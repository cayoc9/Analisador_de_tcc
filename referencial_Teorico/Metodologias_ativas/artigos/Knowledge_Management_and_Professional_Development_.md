**Abstract** 

The purposes of this study were to develop a teacher training program that integrates knowledge management (KM) and blended learning and examine its effects on pre-service teachers’ professional development in creativity instruction. The  employed  KM  model  was  the  SECI,  which  consists  of  four  modes  of knowledge  conversion:  socialization,  externalization,  combination,  and internalization.  Forty-four  pre-service  teachers  participated  in  this  17-week experimental  instructional  program.  Repeated  Measure  Analysis  of  Variance revealed that the training program designed in this study effectively improved pre-service teachers’ professional knowledge and personal teaching efficacy in their teaching of creativity.

1. **INTRODUCTION** 

Creativity,  defined  as  the  process  in  which  an  individual  generates  a contextually and culturally original and valuable product within a certain domain, plays a crucial role in today’s society (Yeh, 2004). It is generally agreed that certain basic elements of creativity can be nurtured through the accumulation of various life experiences (Simonton, 2003) and that the nature of these experiences may be affected by school education, especially teacher behavior (Yeh & Wu, 2006).  Teacher  behavior  is  profoundly  influenced  by  a  teacher’s  professional knowledge  (Borko  &  Putnam,  1995)  and  personal  teaching  efficacy  (Albion, 2001; Aguirre & Speer, 2000). To enhance learners’ creativity, therefore, teachers must  develop these  knowledge  and  belief  in  the  context  of  the  instruction  of creativity. 

Recently,  the  integration  of  knowledge  management  (KM)  in  instructional design has become an important pedagogical element in higher education. KM involves knowledge sharing, creation, validation, presentation, distribution, and application  (Bhatt;  2001;  Holm,  2001);  it  also  emphasizes  the  integration  of technologies  (Gurteen,  1998;  Schmidt,  2005).  To  date,  few  KM  studies  have focused on pre-service teachers’ development of creativity instruction, although several studies have investigated the effects of integrating KM into curriculum 


design (e.g., Kidwell, Vander, & Johnson, 2000; Rees & Lu, 2009) or the effects of KM on professional development and self-efficacy (e.g., Fung, 2005; Sammour, Schreurs, Zoubi, & Vanhoof, 2008; Endres, Endres, Chowdhury, & Alam, 2007). Moreover,  it  has  been  found  that  a  blended  learning  approach  combining classroom  instruction  and  e-learning  is  more  effective  than  a  pure  e-learning approach (Osguthorpe & Graham, 2003). This study therefore tried to design a teacher  training  program  based  on  KM  theories  and  further,  to  enhance  pre- service  teachers’  professional  knowledge  and  personal  teaching  efficacy  of creativity instruction in a blended learning environment. 

2. **KM AND ITS RELATIONSHIP TO BLENDED LEARNING** 
1. **Definitions of KM** 

Numerous  definitions  of  KM  have  been  proposed,  and  three  major approaches for studying KM (technological, organizational, and ecological) have been developed. The technological approach focuses on tools that can be used to enhance knowledge sharing and creation. For example, Mahesh and Suresh (2004) defined  KM  as  the*  strategic  management  of  people  and  knowledge 

4 

representations in an organization using specific technologies and processes to optimize  knowledge  sharing.  A  study  from  the  American  Productivity  and Quality  Center  (AP  &  QC)  also  stated  that  organizations  generally  require  a suitable IT infrastructure to implement KM strategies (AP & QC, 1997). In the organizational  approach,  organization  design  and  workflows  are  optimized. Gurteen  (1998)  described  KM  as  an  emerging  set  of  principles  that  govern organizational  and  business  process  design,  as  well  as  specific  processes, applications, and technologies that help knowledge workers apply their creativity to  achieve  specific  goals.  In  the  same  vein,  Hult  (2003)  defined  KM  as  the organized and systematic process of generating and disseminating information, as well as using explicit and tacit knowledge to achieve a competitive advantage in the marketplace. Finally, the ecological focus emphasizes interactions between people, identity, knowledge, and environmental factors. Hasanali (2002) pointed out that the keys to successful knowledge management can be divided into five major  categories:  (1)  leadership;  (2)  culture;  (3)  structure,  roles,  and responsibilities; (4) information technology infrastructure; and (5) measurement. The interactions between these elements allow the success of KM. 

Although the emphases of KM vary depending on the specific perspective taken, three components are common to all of these approaches: people, processes, 


and  technology.  In  a  school  setting,  KM  can  be  defined  as  the  process  of knowledge sharing and creation via technology, in which learners first organize and internalize explicit knowledge into tacit knowledge  and then convert tacit knowledge to explicit knowledge via interactions among different “ecological” systems.   

2. **The SECI model** 

The well-known SECI model, first proposed by Nonaka (1991), describes how  explicit  and  tacit  knowledge  is  generated,  transferred,  and  recreated  in organizations.  More  specifically,  the  SECI  model  consists  of  four  modes  of knowledge  conversion:  socialization  (tacit  to  tacit),  externalization  (tacit  to explicit), combination (explicit to explicit), and internalization (explicit to tacit) (Nonaka, 1991). “Socialization” is the process of sharing tacit knowledge through observation,  imitation,  practice,  and  participation  in  formal  and  informal communities. Socialization usually begins with building a field or space of social interaction.  “Externalization”  is  a  process  of  articulating  tacit  knowledge  as explicit concepts; this is the key to knowledge creation.  “Combination” is the process of  integrating concepts  into a knowledge system to integrate multiple 

6 

bodies  of  explicit  knowledge.  Finally,  “internalization”  is  the  process  of embodying explicit knowledge into tacit knowledge (Nonaka & Takeuchi, 1995). 

`  `Accordingly,  the  SECI  emphasizes  the  dynamic  of  transforming  the tacit/explicit  interplay  into  novel  products.  These  processes  are  complex  and important for learning. In teacher education, KM should focus on how to help teachers identify, create, represent, distribute, and enable the adoption of good teaching practices in collaborative settings. The SECI should be a good model for teacher training. 

3. **KM and blended learning** 

Blended  learning,  which  combines  classroom  instruction  with  e-learning, can maximize the benefits of both face-to-face and online methods (Osguthorpe & Graham, 2003). According to Dziuban, Hartman, and Moskal (2004), blended learning  refers  to  a  redesign  of  the  instructional  model  with  the  following characteristics: (1) a shift from teacher-centered to student-centered instruction in which  students  become  active  and  interactive  learners;  (2)  increased  student- instructor,  student-student,  student-content,  and  student-outside  resources interactions; and (3) integrated formative and summative assessment mechanisms for students and  instructors.  These characteristics  make  blended  learning very 


effective. It has been found that the use of blended learning in teacher training programs could effectively improve pre-service teachers’ critical-thinking skills, personal  teaching  efficacy,  and  professional  knowledge  of  critical-thinking instruction (Yeh, 2008). 

Schmidt (2005) pointed out that KM and e-learning both aim to facilitate learning  within  organizations,  but  via  two  different  paradigms.  The  main difference between KM and e-learning is that the former assumes knowledge can be actively produced or transferred, while the latter assumes that learning needs to be  improved  through  guidance.  Although  these  two  learning  approaches  may appear to be contradictory from certain perspectives, they can be complementary when the blended learning approach is employed. In other words, guided practice or scaffolding can be integrated into the KM approach to enhance knowledge production  and  knowledge  transfer  through  both  face-to-face  and  online interactions.

3. **KM AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT OF CREATIVITY INSTRUCTION** 
1. **Professional knowledge and personal teaching efficacy in creativity instruction** 

   It is assumed that teachers’ practice is based on their professional knowledge (Borko  &  Putnam,  1995).  This  professional  knowledge  can  be  developed  by adopting  learning  theories  and  achieving  “an  eclectic  compromise  formed  by selecting aspects of opposing theories and taking a position somewhere among them so as to form a mosaic pattern” (Bigge & Shermis, 1999, p. 2). Two types of professional  knowledge  are  required  for  effective  teaching,  namely,  content knowledge  and  pedagogical  content  knowledge  (Bigge  &  Shermis,  1999; Shulman,  1987).  Based on theories  of  teaching  (Shulman,  1987)  and  creative thinking  (e.g.,  Amabile,  1996;  Cropley,  2000;  Csikszentmihalyi,  1999;  Fleith, 2000;  Lubart  &  Getz,  1997;  Mellou,  1996;  Runco,  1996;  Simonton,  2000; Sternberg & Lubart, 1999; Yeh, 2004), we have defined “content knowledge” in creativity  instruction  as  a  teacher’s  understanding  of  creative  thinking,  the prerequisites  of  a  good  creative-thinker,  and  the  factors  that  influence  the 


development of creativity. In contrast, “pedagogical content knowledge” refers to a teacher’s understanding of how to design a curriculum to teach students creative thinking,  how  to  select  the  most  effective  pedagogies  for  imparting  creative- thinking skills, how to best employ effective teacher behaviors in the classroom, and how to assess students’ creativity.  

Another important factor, teacher efficacy, comprises teaching efficacy and personal teaching efficacy (Gibson & Dembo, 1984). Teaching efficacy refers to a  teacher’s  belief  that  his  or  her  ability  to  bring  about  change  is  limited  by external factors, while personal teaching efficacy refers to a teacher’s belief that he or she has the competence to bring about student learning. Some studies have suggested that teacher efficacy is also closely related to teachers’ commitment to teaching,  adoption  of  innovations,  and  employment  of  effective  classroom strategies (Albion, 2001; Aguirre & Speer, 2000; Kulinna & Silverman, 2000). To make  pre-service  teachers  more  efficacious,  some  researchers  (e.g.,  Bandura, 1997; Tillema, 2000) have suggested that guided practices and reflective teaching should be incorporated into teacher training programs; moreover, increasing self- awareness and encouraging mindful learning enhances reflective teaching (Titone, Sherman, and Palmer, 1998).  

Creativity is the result of interactions between an individual’s knowledge, 

10 

dispositions, and skills (Yeh, 2004). For example, Runco, Nemiro, and Walberg (1998) declared that a sound base of knowledge was the most important factor for the  development  of  creativity  and  that  the  ability  to  build  new  schemas  is important for knowledge-building. Simonton (2000) found that creative people generally have independent and unconventional personality traits as well as broad interests,  openness  to  new  experiences,  conspicuous  behavioral  and  cognitive flexibility, and exhibit risk-taking behaviors. Moreover, Feldhusen (1995) claimed that creative thinking is a metacognitive process in which the abilities to plan, monitor, and evaluate cognitive operations are required. Accordingly, personal teaching efficacy in creativity instruction should be defined as a teacher’s belief that he or she can improve these traits and skills in students.  

2. **KM, professional knowledge, and personal teaching efficacy in creativity instruction**  

   To  date,  few  studies  have  investigated the  relationship  between  KM  and teacher efficacy, although several have focused on the connection between KM and professional development in management (e.g., Fung, 2005) and education (e.g., Sammour et al., 2008). In particular, Sammour et al. (2008) suggested that 


KM can be used to capture, organize, and deliver knowledge within management systems and can therefore be an effective tool for educational training. However, the relationship between KM and teacher efficacy has not yet been determined. Several  studies  have  suggested  that  that  self-efficacy  could  enhance  KM performance (Endres, et al., 2007; Lai, 2009) although few reports have shown that KM can reinforce self-efficacy (Louise & Rachna, 2009). Louise et al. (2009) developed an ETK model (emotional, technological, and knowledge competence) and  integrated  it  into  KM.  Their  results  suggested  that  self-efficacy  can  be influenced  by  intervention  and  treatment.  According  to  the  aforementioned suggestions and findings, it can be inferred that a KM system with deliberate instruction design can be an effective tool  for improving pre-service teachers’ professional knowledge and personal teaching efficacy in creativity instruction. 

4. **HYPOTHESES OF THIS STUDY** 

The major purpose of this study was to develop a KM-based training program in a blended learning environment and examine its effects on pre-service teachers’ professional knowledge and personal teaching efficacy relative to their teaching of creativity. Two hypotheses were proposed: (1) The KM-based training program would  improve  pre-service  teachers’  professional  knowledge  in  creativity 

12 

instruction.  (2)  The  KM-based  training  program  would  improve  pre-service teachers’ personal teaching efficacy in creativity instruction.  

5. **METHOD** 
1. **Participants** 

The participants were 44 pre-service teachers (9 males and 35 females) who were enrolled in a “Creative-Thinking Instruction” course offered by a two-year program  for  secondary  school  teachers  in  Taiwan.  The  mean  age  of  the participants was 21.30 (*SD* = 4.14). 

2. **Instruments** 

The instruments employed in this study were the NCCU e-learning platform (http://wm3.nccu.edu.tw/learn/index.php),  the  *Inventory  of  Professional Knowledge  in  Creativity  Instruction*  (IPK-CI),  and  the  *Inventory  of  Personal Teaching  Efficacy  in  Creativity  Instruction*  (IPTE-CI).  The  NCCU  e-learning platform consisted of an Information Center, Assessment Center, Communication 


Center, Personal Area, and Public Zone. The instructional design in this study required participants to complete a series of group assignments based on the SECI model, so it was expected that the Topic Discussion and Group Discussion pages in the Communication Center would be the most commonly used interfaces.  

Both  the  IPK-CI  and  the  PTE-CI  were  developed  by  the  researchers  and designed as a 6-point Likert scale with response options ranging from “totally disagree” to “totally agree”. The results of factor analysis indicated that the IPK- CI  comprised  two  factors:  “content  knowledge”  (4  items)  and  “pedagogical content  knowledge”  (4  items).  The  total  variance  explained  was  67%.  The Cronbach’s α coefficients for the IPK-CI and the two factors were 0.88, 0.79, and 0.85, respectively. Moreover, the correlation of the two factors were *r*(71) = 0.67, *p* < 0.01. Within the teachers sampled in this study, the explained variance was 75%. The Cronbach’s α coefficients for the IPK-CI and the two factors were 0.96, 0.96, and 0.90, respectively. Moreover, the correlation of the two factors were *r*(33)  =  0.91,  *p*  <  0.01.  In  addition,  each  of  the  IPK-CI  items  requested  the participants to describe his or her knowledge related to the item. This written portion  was  scored  on  a  100-point  scale  in  order  to  check  the  participants’ professional  knowledge.  For  example,  the  test  item  “I  can  clearly  define creativity.” was accompanied by a request to define creativity.

The results of factor analysis also indicated that the IPTE-CI was composed of two factors: “knowledge and skill improvement” (7 items) and “disposition improvement” (5 items). The total variance explained was 58%. The Cronbach’s α coefficients for the IPTE-CI and the two factors were 0.90, 0.85, and 0.84, respectively. The correlation of the two factors was *r*(71) = 0.69, *p* < 0.01. Within the  teachers  sampled  in  this  study,  the  explained  variance  was  66%.  The Cronbach’s α coefficients for the IPTE-CI and the two factors were 0.93, 0.90, and 0.88, respectively. The correlation of the two factors was *r*(43) = 0.77, *p* < 0.01.  The  test  items  included  statements  such  as  “I  believe  that  I  can  make students active creative thinkers through my classroom teaching.”  

3. **Experimental design and procedures** 

This  study  employed  a  before-and-after  design.  A  17-week  experimental instruction  program  integrating  the  SECI  model  and  blended  learning  was employed and administered by the first researcher. Pre-tests were given in the first week and post-tests were completed in the 17th week. The pre-tests included only  the  IPK-CI  and  the  IPTE-CI,  whereas  the  post-tests  also  included  the reflection questionnaire. In the second week, the participants were divided into 


eight  groups of  their  own  choosing  and  asked  to  complete  a  series  of  group assignments  in the  following weeks. The  instructional goals of the  first stage (from  weeks  1-6)  were  to  enhance  the  participants’  self-awareness  of  their professional knowledge and personal teaching efficacy via the pre-tests, as well as to enhance their content knowledge and personal teaching efficacy via guided explorations  of  the  concept of  creativity,  the  prerequisites  of  a  good  creative thinker, and the factors that influence creativity development. The instructional goals of the second stage (from weeks 7-17) were to further improve the teachers’ pedagogical  knowledge  through  scaffolding  techniques  and  to  enhance  their personal teaching efficacy in creativity instruction. This was achieved through multiple  practical  applications  of  creativity  instructional  strategies  in  both classroom and online settings.  

More specifically, the instructional design was based on the SECI model including socialization, externalization, combination, and internalization. Blended learning was emphasized in this instructional design; class discussions followed online discussions. All topic discussions were graded in order to facilitate online dialogue. The topic discussions included discussions of creative products, creative instructions,  mind  maps,  and  stories  of  positive  thinking.  In  addition,  the dynamics  of  the  SECI  processes  were  emphasized,  i.e.,  most  of  the  group 

16 

assignments required the participants to experience all four process of SECI. 

4. **Data analysis** 

Several Repeated Measure Analyses of Variance were performed to evaluate the  effects  of  the  designed  program  on  improvements  in  the  participants’ professional knowledge and personal teaching efficacy in creativity instruction.  

6. **RESULTS** 
1. **Improvements in professional knowledge of creativity instruction** 

Table 1 depicts the participants’ mean scores in the IPK-CI. For the Likert- type scale, a Repeated Measure Analysis of Variance yielded a significant Test (pre-test vs. post-test) × Factor (content knowledge vs. pedagogical knowledge) interaction  effect,  Wilks’  Λ  =  0.462,  *p*  =  0.000,  η2  =  0.538.  The  following analyses  found  that  all  simple  main  effects  were  significant.  Specifically,  the participants  scored  higher  in  content  knowledge  than  in  pedagogical  content knowledge on both the pre-test and the post-test, *F*(1, 32) = 50.720, *p* = 0.000, *η*2 


- 0.613 and *F*(1,32) = 4.362, *p* = 0.045, η2 = 0.120, respectively. Moreover, the participants scored higher on the post-test than on the pre-test in both content knowledge and pedagogical content knowledge, *F*(1, 32) = 14.259, *p* = 0.001, η2 
- 0.308 and *F*(1,32) = 45.696, *p* = 0.000, η2 = 0.588 (see Table 2).

7. **DISCUSSION** 

Two  hypotheses  were  proposed  in  this  study  to  test  whether  KM-based training in a blended learning environment could improve pre-service teachers’ professional  knowledge  and  personal  teaching  efficacy  related  to  creativity instruction. Both hypotheses were  supported by the significant effects  yielded from Repeated Measure Analyses of Variance. More specifically, the analytical results  in  this  study  showed that  the  designed  training  program  based  on  the integration of the SECI model and blended learning was effective in improving the pre-service teachers’ professional knowledge (especially content knowledge) and personal teaching efficacy pertaining to their teaching of creativity.  

This study applied specific instructional design concepts in each stage of the SECI model. In the socialization stage, the participants were asked to build a learning community, engage in observational learning, and participate in both the class and online group discussion. These activities allowed the participants to share  their  tacit  content  knowledge  and  pedagogical  knowledge.  In  the externalization stage, the participants were encouraged to express their opinions in  class  and  online  discussions.  Moreover,  the  participants  were  requested  to present group assignments that allowed them to practice teaching strategies for 


creativity instruction. The participants thus articulated their tacit knowledge as explicit  concepts,  strengthening  their  professional  knowledge  and  personal teaching  efficacy.  In  the  combination  stage,  the  instructor  first  presented systematic  lectures  of  content  and  pedagogical  content  knowledge  and  then requested that the participants design creative products. The designed products included a mind map, a story of positive thinking, and a lesson plan designed to facilitate student creativity. Through these activities, the participants were able to organize the presented concepts into their knowledge systems, further enhancing their  personal  teaching  efficacy.  Finally,  in  the  internalization  stage,  the participants’ self-awareness and reflection on their professional knowledge and personal teaching efficacy were stimulated by feedback from the pre-tests and post-tests and feedback from in-class and online discussions. In addition, there were abundant opportunities for the practice of teaching strategies via in-class and online group interactions. These activities allowed the participants to gradually internalize  their  professional  knowledge  and  personal  teaching  efficacy. Accordingly, the hypotheses regarding the effectiveness of the SECI-based design in this study seem to be well-supported. 

The findings in this study also support the suggestion that technology plays an important role in the practice of KM strategies. For example, Gasson and Shelfer 

24 

(2007) proposed a knowledge-as-process perspective of knowledge management and suggested that information technology (IT) provides practical support for this strategy. In addition, Cartelli (2007) found that integrating SECI with[ Information and Communication Technology ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Information_and_Communication_Technology)(ICT) can improve student learning, knowledge construction, and meaningful learning.   

The SECI model has been validated by several researchers (e.g., Nonaka et al., 1994;  Nonaka  &  Takeuchi,  1995).  Empirical  studies  based  on  this  model, however, are still being developed. The findings in this study support the claim that KM can be an effective tool for educational training (Sammour, et al., 2008) as well as the argument that the means of access to knowledge, the means of knowledge production, and the  forms of knowledge publication are  important factors  in  improving  teachers’  professional  development.  The  findings  in  this study also suggest that a teacher’s development of professional knowledge shares the same process of knowledge creation presented in the SECI model, i.e., the transition from tacit knowledge to explicit knowledge. The SECI model, therefore, is suitable for teacher training and especially for improving teachers’ professional knowledge.  

The close association between teacher efficacy and professional development has been confirmed by many studies (e.g., Albion, 2001; Aguirre et al., 2000; 


Kulinna, et al., 2000). The findings in this study are in line with other studies showing that self-efficacy can be enhanced by the KM system with deliberate instruction  design  (e.g.,  Louise  et  al.,  2009).  In  addition,  the  significant instructional  effects  support  the  suggestion  that  providing  guided  practice, increasing  self-awareness,  encouraging  mindful  learning,  and  provoking reflective  teaching  can  help  pre-service  teachers  become  more  efficacious (Tillema, 2000; Titone, Sherman, and Palmer, 1998).  

8. **CONCLUSION AND SUGGESTIONS** 

Effective  knowledge  management,  which  is  characterized  by  knowledge sharing  and  creation,  is  a  key  component  of  professional  development  in  all knowledge-based  careers.  Nevertheless,  knowledge  management  is  still  only rarely applied in teacher training programs. This study therefore has developed a KM-based training program that integrates the SECI model and blended learning to  improve  pre-service  teachers’  professional  development  with  respect  to creativity instruction. The findings in this study support the effectiveness of such an instructional design. Accordingly, the SECI model and blended learning may be integrated to create a new paradigm for teacher training.  

26 

Finally,  the  application  of  knowledge  management  theories  in  teacher education requires more empirical practices. Future studies should develop more KM-based  teaching  or  training  models  to  enhance  the  effectiveness  of  both learning and instruction*.*
