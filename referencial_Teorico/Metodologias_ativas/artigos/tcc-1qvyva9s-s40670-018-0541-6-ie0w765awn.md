Abstract

The BActive Learning Group^ (ALG) described in this paper is a hybrid form of problem-based learning established at the Cooper Medical School of Rowan University 5 years ago. The present study relates to an overall effort to ensure continuous quality improvement in the undergraduate medical education curriculum. As part of the course evaluation, the Office of Medical Education usesa surveyinstrumenttocollect student opinionsabout the ALG formatand process.The surveyinstrumentfocuses on three domains: (1) professionalism; (2) positive learning experience; and (3) partnership in learning (collaboration). Ninety- five percent of the students value professionalism highly, especially teamwork. The survey results and student evaluations of the cases and facilitators allow us to identify and address deficits in the ALG process as a whole, paying special attention to the quality of the cases and facilitator contributions. In the future, items that elucidate student reflective practice will be included in the survey instrument.

Introduction

In training twenty-first century medical students, there is a pedagogical shift from the teacher-centered didactic approach to small group active learning formats such as problem-based learning (PBL), case-based learning (CBL), and team-based learning (TBL). These new approaches foster higher order thinking, problem solving through collaboration, develop- ment of knowledge, skill, and attitude [\[1](#_page6_x52.00_y267.87)]. Furthermore, these pedagogical approaches are conducive for students  self- directed and self-regulated learning that cultivate life-long learning. These instructional methods (PBL, CBL, and TBL) in medical education create a powerful learning environment [[2](#_page6_x52.00_y297.87)] that changes the role of teacher and student; the teacher acts as a designer and facilitator of learning [\[3](#_page6_x52.00_y337.87)], while the learner does the learning by actively building upon current/ past knowledge with newer knowledge.

Small group active learning fosters collaboration and de- velopment of alternate approaches to problem solving; it re- quires self-directed learning to participate completely as a productive member of the group [\[4](#_page6_x52.00_y357.87)  [6](#_page6_x52.00_y397.87)]. Active learning is generally defined as an instructional approach that engages students in the learning process. In short, active learning re- quires students to do meaningful learning activities and think about what and how they are doing, i.e., student engagement [[6](#_page6_x52.00_y397.87)]. Active Learning Group (ALG), a term coined at Cooper Medical School of Rowan University (CMSRU), is addressed in this study. It is a hybrid form of PBL in which pre-reading material is provided in the form of lectures or podcasts, the facilitator role varies from passive to limitedly active, and the skills learned are critical thinking and clinical problem solv- ing. In ALG, while the learning process is collaborative and student-centered, it is also teacher-centered, i.e., lecture-based to provide external stimuli and structure. Furthermore, while

(what do we know?); clarifying terminology; analyzing the problem (what do we need to know?); self-study for small group discussion; and synthesis and evaluating of the knowl- edge acquired (how do we proceed in finding out what we need to know?) [[7](#_page6_x52.00_y437.87)]. At CMSRU, the students acquire knowl- edge through group discussion (ALG), didactic presentations, actual patient encounters, hands-on experiences in the labora- toriesand,whenappropriate,through simulation.The purpose of the present study is to assess medical student perceptions related to ALG learning as part of an overall effort to ensure continuousquality improvement inthe undergraduatemedical education curriculum.

Methods and Materials

Opened in 2009, CMSRU is a fully accredited, 4-year allo- pathic medical school situated in a large city on the east coast of the USA. Being a new medical school, student enrollment has increased annually: 50 students started in 2012, 64 in 2013; 72 in 2014, 80 in 2015, 88 in 2016, and 96 in 2017. Gender, respective to individual classes, is mostly equal. Student ages range from 22 to 45 with varied cultural back- grounds throughout the student body. The curriculum is inte- grated organ system-based with ample early exposure to clinics included into student schedules. Students have suffi- cient time to reflect upon their learning experiences and en- hance their understanding through self-directed inquiry, early clinical experience, patient care, community service, and scholarly research.

Active Learning Group

Active Learning Group sessions are part of the preclinical curriculum (years 1 and 2) and eight students form a group. Two faculty members (a biomedical scientist and a clinician) facilitate the group in three 2-hour ALG sessions each week.![](Aspose.Words.badf796d-bd16-4d0f-9ce3-befe7f23feb3.014.png)![](Aspose.Words.badf796d-bd16-4d0f-9ce3-befe7f23feb3.015.png)

Every Friday, at the end of school day, students receive basic information about the case for the following week; faculty receive a detailedfacilitatorguide.During the week, the group receives additional releases, such as laboratory study results, imaging reports, and other information that pertains to the case. Throughout each session, in addition to the two facilita- tors in the room, a clinician or two, usually the case authors (content experts) or course directors (not a facilitator), circu- late through the ALG rooms to answer questions students or facilitators might have and point to additional resources. Based on the facilitator s guide, the faculty monitor group discussion and, if necessary, refocus the group s direction. The facilitators or the visiting content expert (case author) do not engage in active teaching, but correct any misconcep- tions about the presented clinical scenario in the case. At the end of each case, students receive the learning objectives for that week s case. Following each ALG session, students at- tend didactic presentations that cover both basic and clinical science aspectsoftheorgan systemthatisbeingstudiedinthat module. These didactic presentations are not debriefing ses- sions, but cover the science behind the organ system module that is being studied. However, the cases do correspond to the organ system, e.g., congestive heart failure or atrial fibrillation during the cardiology module or portal hypertension and co- lon cancer during the gastrointestinal module. The cases are developed for students  self-directed, independent learning and prepares them for group discussion.

Student Evaluation

At the end of each week s case, students receive formative assessments that rate their preparedness, participation through meaningful contribution to the discussion, teamwork, and completionofthe requiredlearningobjectives. The facilitators use a 5-point scale of1 for lowand 5 for highperformance,as shown in the diagram.

Unsatisfactory weekly performance warrants meeting with a learning specialist. At the end of each organ sys- tem module, students receive a summative assessment that includes both cognitive and non-cognitive criteria. The non-cognitive criteria are personal attributes in cre- ating a safe learning environment that includes initiative,

confidence, persistence, integrity, organization, adaptabil- ity, creativity, ethical behavior, and responsibility. Students must achieve at least an average score of 3 to pass each module, based on the facilitator s weekly as- sessments. Failing in ALG requires remediation at the end of the academic year.

At the end of each case, both the students and faculty pro- vide feedback regarding the quality of the case in supporting various learning objectives, deficits in the case, and any areas for improvement. Quality assurance within the institution has shown that multiple iterations of the case are needed to reach intended curricular objectives. At the end of each semester, students evaluate faculty facilitators on their overall contribu- tion to the learning experience during the ALG sessions. At the end of each semester, as a means to provide feedback related to group dynamics and structure, students evaluate themselves and their peers about their preparation, participa- tion by contributing meaningfully to the discussion, collegial- ity,andsharingresources.Thereisnorequirementforstudents to submit any kind of paper or other materials.

Student Experience and Perception About ALG Sessions

To assess student understanding of ALG, a questionnaire that was developed to study student perceptions of team-based learning in anatomy curriculum [\[8](#_page6_x52.00_y457.87)] was modified and adapted for ALG. For the purpose of content and construct validation, a group of 50 students (class of 2016) anonymously complet- ed the modified survey instrument. Based on the feedback, minor adjustments were made to the original questionnaire and the revision has been utilized in this study (Appendix 1). As part of the course evaluation, the questionnaire is admin- isteredtoelicitstudentfeedbackabouttheirexperiencesinand perception of ALG. Students rate the survey statements with Strongly Disagree, Disagree, Agree, or Strongly Agree. In brief, the questions probe student s preparation for group dis- cussions, importance of group discussion for deeper under- standing, and attitudes about group behavior and mutual re- spect during group discussions. At the end of each semester, the Office of the Medical Education administers and collects the evaluations. This study includes data from academic years 2014  2017. The results reflect combined responses to the statements in the questionnaire from students of all the years as detailed in the section on[Results](#_page2_x52.00_y613.87).

Since our study was part of continuing efforts to improve teaching, learning, and assessment, the students consented to the study, which also received IRB-expedited approval from the Rowan University (IRB protocol no. Pro 2017001673).

R<a name="_page2_x52.00_y613.87"></a>esults

The questionnaire was validated in the spring of 2014 by administering it to 50 students in the class of 2016. In subse- quent years, the questionnaire has been administered at the end of each semester and the data analyzed. No missing data imputation strategies were employed; the final sample size

197

(856 students) represents 100% of the respondents for each year (Table[1](#_page2_x0.00_y790.87)).

In brief, the 20-question survey covers three domains: pro- fessionalism, positive learning experience (productivity), and partnership in learning (collaboration).

The overall Cronbach s alpha coefficient of 0.94 indicates high reliability of the questionnaire. When the questionnaire was divided into domains, the alpha coefficient stayed high and reliable. The alpha reliability coefficients analysis for all three domains reveals that all of the coefficients are high enough to be considered acceptable; namely, all items lead to a higher coefficient for the overall scale reliability (Table [2](#_page3_x0.00_y790.87)). The results of reliability for the scales range from 0.69 to 0.95. The highest alpha coefficients are for positive learning experiences (productivity). The reliability coeffi- cients of the scales exceed the value of 0.60, which is consid- ered suitable for research purposes [\[9](#_page6_x52.00_y497.87)]. Thus, the 20-item ALG questionnaire is a valid and reliable instrument to assess medical student perception of the ALG strategy.

Of the three domains, mean score is highest for profession- alism (3.51), followed by positive learning experience (3.22), and partnership in learning-collaboration (3.17). The ability to work as a team and ability to collaborate with peers score the highest (3.69 and 3.52 respectively) in the professionalism domain (Table[3](#_page3_x0.00_y790.87)), followed by positive attitude working with peers (3.43), and mutual respect for team members (3.40).

An important aspect of ALG is the positive learning expe- rience as an indication of productivity (Table [4](#_page4_x0.00_y790.87)). Items reflecting cognitive engagement, such as ALG influence on understanding course material (3.27), correcting mistakes through group discussion to improve understanding (3.19), solving problems in a group (3.35), and developing informa- tion synthesizing skills (3.22), soundly attest to cohesive group performance. Items 3, 5, 6, and 9 show personal satis- faction among the respondents.

Team cohesion and reliance are compelling elements of ALG process. Collectively, the partnership in learning/ collaboration domain (Table[5](#_page4_x0.00_y790.87)) shows (with the exception of item 7) that 92% of the respondents were positive about this process. Coming prepared to the session (3.20), working as a

Student Failure and Remediation

Students are assessed in ALG and required to pass the com- ponent as it relates to individual organ system courses in the curriculum. Since the school s inception, only three students have been unsuccessful in passing the ALG component of their course work. In all three circumstances, the unsuccessful grade related to an assessed lacked of group participation, unexcused absence, a lack of commitment to the group learn- ing process, or some combination of each issue. Each unsuc- cessful grade was met with a customized remediation plan for the individual student shortcomings that involved multiple faculty members and learning support personnel.

Discussion

This study examines the pedagogy of a hybrid PBL in ALG format for a horizontally and vertically integrated organ system-based curriculum. It is built on the premise that ALG as a setting for self-directed learning perpetuates life-long learning. The students appreciate various attributes of ALG concepts, including the challenges and opportunities it offers.

In this survey, we used a 4-point scale, since specific opin- ions of students are critical in our ongoing effort to improve the curriculum. Earlier studies concluded that, although reli- ability tends to increase as the number of response options rises, when the number of alternatives exceeds 5 or 6, reliabil- ity hardly increases further [\[10](#_page6_x307.00_y52.87), [11](#_page6_x307.00_y82.87)]. The clearest conclusion from such research is that the minimum number of categories for ensuring an appropriate level of reliability is 4. Lozano et al. concluded that fewer than 4 alternatives decrease the reliability and validity [\[12](#_page6_x307.00_y122.87)].

A number of studies have explored the perceptions of stu- dents [[13](#_page6_x307.00_y152.87)  [16](#_page6_x307.00_y272.87)] and faculty [[17](#_page6_x307.00_y312.87), [18](#_page6_x307.00_y342.87)] about PBL and its implica- tion for educational reform. In order to fully explore student perceptionsabouttheALGformat,wevalidatedaninstrument thatconsistsof20items inthree domains.The alphareliability coefficientsanalysisforallthreedomainsrevealsthatallofthe coefficients are high enough to be considered acceptable; all items lead to a higher coefficient for the overall scale reliabil- ity (Table [2](#_page3_x0.00_y790.87)).

To our knowledge, most studies on PBL or TBL have con- centrated on knowledge acquisitions as the primary outcome, but rarely evaluate the student perception related to profes- sionalism per se. Professionalism in a wider sense embraces altruism, integrity, accountability, excellence, responsibility, service, honor, and respect for others. In the present study, 95% of the respondents valued factors impacting profession- alism as the most important of the three domains (Table[3](#_page3_x0.00_y790.87)). In his article on the taxonomy of PBL, Barrows [\[19](#_page6_x307.00_y372.87)] identified four major objectives: structuring of knowledge and clinical context;clinicalreasoning;self-directedlearning;andintrinsic

motivation, but professionalism was not specifically listed [[20](#_page6_x307.00_y402.87)]. One could argue that professionalism is an outcome in a PBL setting that results from one s attitude and ability to work as a team and respecting peers. Professionalism is one of CMSRU s nine major objectives. About 93% of the CMSRU respondents express this positive attitude regarding working with peers (Table [3](#_page3_x0.00_y790.87)), reflecting classroom relation- ships and engagement that is vital to the PBL concept and the success of the student. Detailed analysis of our results shows that, at whichever stage the students are in their medical edu- cation (years 1  4), they all feel that professionalism is one of the important aspects of their training. A number of elements in this study (question items 2, 4, 12, 15, 17, and 20) reflect professional competencies. A recent article indicates a posi- tive impact on student attainment of the professionalism com- petencies in the PBL curriculum, as compared to students in a traditional curriculum [\[21](#_page6_x307.00_y442.87)].

In teaching-learning process, a positive attitude is regarded as an important feature of affective domain, which is cultivat- ed through collaboration [\[22](#_page6_x307.00_y512.87)] and is reflected in the response toitems 1,3,9,and 14(Table[4](#_page4_x0.00_y790.87)).The ALGformatemphasizes

the significance of affective characteristics of students, along with cognitive characteristics, in supporting student success.

It is evident from student responses to items 8, 16, and 17 that 90% or more of the students work in a collaborative man- ner that necessitates advanced preparation and in-depth con- tent-specific knowledge. Furthermore, an important compo- nent of student weekly assessment includes teamwork and meaningful contribution to the discussion. Responses to items 2, 15, and 18 show a realization among students that the im- portance of teamwork is a testament to work ethic. It is im- portant to note that item 7 is a negative statement and, as anticipated, the majority of the respondents seem to learn bet- ter in the ALG format. The result also indicates that a small number of students perceive traditional teacher-centered learning as more effective than the student-centered ALG for- mat. This is in agreement with an earlier report that indicates similar sentiment. In spite of such student perceptions, the test scores were similar [\[7](#_page6_x52.00_y437.87)].

In exploring student perception of the ALG format, we learned several things. First, the survey instrument with high alpha coefficient enables accuracy of the study. The three

domains with high acceptable alpha coefficient allow us to learn about our students and, at the same time, provide valu- able information toaddress someof the perceived deficits. For example, 20% of the students thought ALG cases did not help them master core information. In a similar sense, a good pro- portion of the students felt that they learned better through didactic presentation and this also requires a concerted effort through curricular development. Whether any of these are related to the quality of cases that affect group functioning needs to be explored. Ill-structured cases diminish the ability of group discussion to expand knowledge, resulting in a sense that more didactic presentations are needed.

Limitations of the Study

One of the limitations of this study is a lack of items in the instrument that clearly focus on self-reflection. CMSRU is in its fifth year, and the pedagogy is new to all the facilitators; hence, a firm conclusion is hard to establish. The results pre- sented are from an early cohort of students for most of whom active learning and self-directed learning are new concepts. CMSRU follows a holistic admission process; enrolled stu- dents include non-traditional populations. It is worthwhile to compare our study with other studies where a similar admis- sion process is used. However, the survey results have identi- fied areas where the curriculum needs revision. Another po- tential limitation of the study relates to concerns of the stu- dents to honestly deliver feedback related to the curricular activities. Students are reassured numerous times at CMSRU that all evaluation tools are anonymous and their honest feed- back is needed and welcomed. Facilitators are required to participate in faculty development before officially assessing students in their groups.

Future Directions

This study allowed us to use student perceptions about ALG toconduct a faculty development program.We plantoinclude items that elucidate student reflective practice into the instru- ment. In the next phase of our study, we plan to explore dif- ferences instudent perception about various facilitator groups. We anticipate that this will assist in planning a better-focused faculty development program.

Conclusion

In his 2004 review article, Michael Prince [\[22](#_page6_x307.00_y512.87)] asked the question BDoes active learning work?^ In a review of the literature, it is clear that, for active learning to work, creating a context (cases) is one of the most important factors. In this study exploring the student perception of ALG pedagogy, we created and validated an instrument with high alpha coeffi- cient. The results allowed us to understand that the quality of cases and engagement with them led to satisfaction among students and, at the same time, also enhanced awareness of various aspects of professional behavior. Based on student totalperformanceinvariouscoursesduringtheacademic year, we additionallyconcludethatstudentsacquire deepercontent- specific knowledge and enthusiastically discuss that knowl- edge with their peers to enhance the learning of everyone in the group.
