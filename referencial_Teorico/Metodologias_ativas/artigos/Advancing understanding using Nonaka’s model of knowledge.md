**Abstract:** Nonaka’s model of knowledge creation can provide guidance in designing learning environments and experiences. However, Bereiter is critical of the model because it does not address whether understanding is deepened in the process of socialization, externalization, combination and internalization. To address this issue of understanding, this study proposed a framework that synthesizes the basic phases of problem-based learning with Nonaka’s model. This design-based study investigated if a course designed based of this synthesized framework can help stimulate knowledge creation that is based on deepening understanding. Based on analysis  of  multiple data  sources,  the  findings  suggest  that  the  participants  demonstrated advancing understanding amidst knowledge creating conditions and processes consistent with Nonaka’s model and the problem-based learning approach.

**Framing of this study**

Studies (Tee & Karney, 2010; Tee & Lee, 2011) suggest that Nonaka’s model of knowledge creation (Nonaka, Toyama  & Byosiere,  2001)  can provide  some  guidance in  designing  learning  activities  that  can  facilitate knowledge  creation. However,  Bereiter  (2002,  p.158-168)  was  critical of Nonaka’s  model  of  knowledge creation.  He  argued  that  one  of  the  key  weaknesses  of  Nonaka’s  model  is  that  it  offers  “nothing  about understanding  and  depth  of  understanding”  (p.161).  This  is  crucial,  Bereiter  argued,  because  fundamental understanding is what differentiates from blind luck or serendipitous imitation. He argued that understanding is the  crux  of  expert  knowing,  and  a  model  that  does  not  explicitly  address  the  issue  of  understanding  is fundamentally flawed. 

In  an  attempt  to  address  this  issue  of  understanding,  the  basic  phases  of  PBL,  or  problem-based learning,  (Bransford  &  Stein,  2002;  Hmelo-Silver,  2004)  are  built  onto  the  two  layers  of  *ba* and  SECI. According  to  Hmelo-Silver  (2004),  the basic  premise  of  PBL  is to  situate learning  in  inquiry-based, collaborative,  iterative,  reflective  and  self-directed  problem-solving  contexts.  This  creates  opportunities  for learners to focus on an authentic and complex problem and then seek ways to critically evaluate, choose and use emerging  knowledge to  address  the  problem. This,  in  essence,  should  lay  the  foundation  for  deeper understanding. In this regard, this paper reports on a study attempting to understand better how Nonaka’s model can be used to stimulate knowledge creation, and, if and how deeper understanding is cultivated. With Nonaka’s model as a backdrop to stimulate knowledge-creating conditions and processes, problem-based learning is used as the basic approach to drive at understanding (Hmelo-Silver, 2004). The knowledge-base in the context of this study is technology, pedagogy and content knowledge, or TPACK (Mishra & Koehler, 2006), a framework built based on Shulman’s (1986) seminal work on pedagogical content knowledge. In essence, a teacher who has cultivated advanced TPACK will exhibit a nuanced capability to critically choose or even design and configure, learn, and apply the technologies that will best meet the teaching and learning needs within their context.  

This  research  was  conducted  using  the design-based  research  process.  Three types  of  data  were collected, namely: reflections, student-created artifacts, and online discussions. In this study, credibility was addressed with four techniques—triangulation, prolonged engagement, persistent observation, and referential adequacy. The data were coded based on the Nonaka framework and indicators of understandings that emerged from the PBL process. Coding was done by two coders, independently in the first round and collaboratively in the second until consensus was reached.  

**Advancing understanding by design**

The students of this course comprised of 18 in-service teachers, with their ages ranging from mid-20s to early 40s. They taught different subjects at elementary, secondary and tertiary levels. For reporting and discussion purposes, the focus will be on Group A which consisted of three in-service teachers: A1, A2, and A3 who teach language arts (Chinese) in high school. A1 has been teaching for 16 years, with minimal use of technology. A2 has been teaching for 14 years, and has been exploring different technologies with limited success. A3 has been teaching for 20 years, and has never really used technology to enhance learning. The problem they chose to focus on: their students’ struggle in writing essays in Chinese, a second language for most of their students. The environment  (which  is known  as  *ba* in Nonaka’s model) was created  to  enable conditions  of  autonomy, fluctuation and creative chaos, redundancy, requisite variety, and trust and commitment (due to limited space, this data is discussed in a separate paper). The following table presents the main data and findings:

**Conclusion**

The findings of this study suggest that a problem-based learning approach designed together with a conducive *ba* to stimulate socialization, externalization, combination and internalization can help teachers deepen their understanding in context of TPACK. They started with simplistic views of how technology itself can transform learning, but over time, began to demonstrate progressing knowledge and understanding of using pedagogical methods and technologies in ways that give the students the best opportunities to achieve the intended learning outcomes. Further studies need to be done to further explicate this synthesized framework.
