ABSTRACT ARTICLE HISTORY ![](Aspose.Words.1d9a226b-9e24-4d80-8559-e7db1aea2abc.022.png)**Background:** Academic learning  in higher  education  Received 16 February 2022  requires  diverse activities such as reading,  reviewing,  Revised 16 February 2023  and discussion.

dies on the  effect of the  combination  of these  activ-

ities  on  learning  outcomes.  In  this  study,  we 

investigated  the  combination  of self-study  and  dis-

cussions at a selective Korean university.

**Methods:**  The present  study  compared  the  two-part 

instructional  sequence  of  three  groups:  watching 

a video lecture  (LD) and  self-study (SD) groups,  both 

followed  by  student-led  discussions,  and  reviewing 

after  watching  a video  lecture  (LR) group.  We com-

pared  test  results  using  verbatim,  paraphrased,  and 

transfer  items. We also carried out  in-depth  analyses 

of dialogs in the discussions.

**Findings:** In three separate experiments, we found that 

the  discussion  groups  scored  significantly higher  than 

the  review group.  Moreover, the  SD group  performed 

better  than  the LD group  of the two discussion groups. 

Analyses of dialogue  suggest  that  self-study  elicited 

more  active and  productive  content  from the  students 

than  lectures, leading  to superior  performance.

**Contribution:** Our results  indicate  that  self-study  can 

significantly enhance  the learning effect of discussions.
# **Introduction**
Academic learning in higher education requires diverse activities such as reading texts, listening to lectures, holding discussions with others, and solving related  problems  and  tasks. These learning  activities are  com- <a name="_page1_x54.90_y543.52"></a>plex, and  each has its research agenda, such as processing models and underlying mechanisms (see Cho et al., [2015](#_page17_x54.90_y463.00); Dunlosky & Rawson, [2019](#_page17_x54.90_y540.16);

<a name="_page2_x54.90_y46.86"></a>Mayer & Alexander, [2011](#_page18_x54.90_y182.52); Moje et al., [2020](#_page18_x54.90_y349.85) for a general overview). For example, reading  texts  and  listening  to  lectures  provide  students  with organized  knowledge; discussions  enable  them  to  share  their  under- standing  or  to  generate  alternative  interpretations  of  knowledge; and solving  related  problems  is  used  to  assess students’  knowledge  and understanding.  Thus, except for classes that require direct performance, such  as experiments  or  practices, it  is important  to  balance and  align these  activities based  on  the  learning  material’s content  and  the  stu- dent’s characteristics.

Surprisingly, however, there are relatively few studies on the effect of the combination of these activities on learning outcomes. The purpose of com- bining various learning activities is to enhance the learning effect.

A seminal learning sciences study found that some sequences of activities are better than other sequences and that transfer of learning is the litmus test <a name="_page2_x54.90_y241.86"></a>in comparing the effectiveness of different sequences of learning (Schwartz & Bransford, [1998](#_page19_x54.90_y139.06)). In their  Experiment 3, Schwartz and  Bransford divided participants  into three groups. The first group was told to summarize the given material before listening to a lecture. The second group was told to analyze the material twice, and the last group was told to analyze the material before listening to a lecture. Afterward, all three groups were given a true- false recognition test and a transfer task. They found that although there was no difference in the recognition test performance among the three groups, in the transfer task, the group which analyzed the material before listening to a lecture performed significantly better than the other two groups.

Other  studies have also found  that  unique  combinations  of learning <a name="_page2_x54.90_y384.86"></a>activities promote student learning, such as the combination of an invention <a name="_page2_x54.90_y397.86"></a>activity and the availability of a worked example (Schwartz & Martin, [2004](#_page19_x54.90_y161.66)), <a name="_page2_x54.90_y410.86"></a>studying alone beforehand and then collaborating, (Lam & Muldner, [2017](#_page18_x54.90_y149.05); <a name="_page2_x54.90_y423.86"></a>Tsovaltzi et al., [2015](#_page19_x54.90_y387.66)) and generative preparation before collaboration (Lam 

- Kapur, [2018](#_page18_x54.90_y115.59); Mende et al., [2021](#_page18_x54.90_y249.45)). In addition, students who were taught after the problem-solving phase demonstrated  significantly greater concep- <a name="_page2_x54.90_y462.86"></a>tual understanding and ability to transfer to novel problems than those who were taught first and then solved problems (Kapur, [2014](#_page18_x54.90_y93.28)).

  We investigated a two-part instructional sequence. In the first part of the sequence, we considered self-study. Self-study is a good candidate to replace traditional lectures. In the present study, we defined self-study as individual or solitary learning to understand  or master the learning material which is selected by capable others  such as teachers or  instructors.  Self-study can include activities such as reading and re-reading, rehearsing, self-explaining, taking notes, or drawing a concept map etc. Still, it does not  have direct instruction, such as lectures.

  Finding  replacements  for the  traditional  didactic lecture is important because the  learning  outcome  of lectures is relatively low, despite their <a name="_page3_x54.90_y46.86"></a>popularity  (e.g., Deslauriers et al., [2019](#_page17_x54.90_y496.06); Stains et al., [2018](#_page19_x54.90_y252.06)). Moreover, Bonawitz et al. ([2011](#_page17_x54.90_y275.61)) showed that direct instruction could limit spontaneous <a name="_page3_x54.90_y85.86"></a>exploration and discovery. Thus, while lectures are helpful but not crucial for learning (e.g., Bonawitz et al., [2011](#_page17_x54.90_y275.61); Poh et al., [2010](#_page18_x54.90_y506.02); Schmidt et al., [2010](#_page18_x54.90_y550.64)), self-study can provide an opportunity  for learners to consolidate learning better or integrate new knowledge (e.g., Fiorella & Mayer,[ 2016](#_page17_x54.90_y573.22)). Self-study is <a name="_page3_x54.90_y137.86"></a>also meaningful because it involves agency yet serves as a basis for coopera- tive learning, such as discussions with others (e.g., Fiorella & Mayer, [2016](#_page17_x54.90_y573.22); <a name="_page3_x54.90_y163.86"></a>Lam & Kapur, [2018](#_page18_x54.90_y115.59); Lam & Muldner, [2017](#_page18_x54.90_y149.05); Mende et al., [2021](#_page18_x54.90_y249.45)). Students often find it difficult to learn cooperatively (Andrews & Rapp, [2015](#_page17_x54.90_y231.52)). This difficulty can be alleviated through  prior self-study because self-study acti- vates prior knowledge, exposes knowledge gaps, and facilitates engagement.

  The second part of our instructional sequence is discussions. Discussions <a name="_page3_x54.90_y228.86"></a>are a common activity in the classroom, and there is a great deal of evidence <a name="_page3_x54.90_y241.86"></a>that they are beneficial for learning (e.g., Murphy et al., [2009](#_page18_x54.90_y461.40), [2018](#_page18_x54.90_y416.78); Soter et al.,[ 2008](#_page19_x54.90_y206.86)). Murphy et al. ([2009](#_page18_x54.90_y461.40)), for example, performed a meta-analysis of 42 papers  published  between 1964 and  2003 and  found  that  high-level comprehension,  critical thinking,  reasoning  and  argumentation  of text improved with discussions among elementary and junior high school.

  <a name="_page3_x54.90_y306.86"></a>The attractiveness of discussion is that successful discussions can be one <a name="_page3_x54.90_y319.86"></a>of the most effective learning activities. Chi and colleagues (Chi & Wylie,  [2014](#_page17_x54.90_y429.93); Chi, [2009](#_page17_x54.90_y319.70); Menekse et al., [2013](#_page18_x54.90_y282.91)) have emphasized interactive learning activities such as discussions. They proposed the Interactive-Constructive- Active-Passive (ICAP) framework and found that academic achievement was lowest at P, then increased at A, C, and I in ascending order.

  <a name="_page3_x54.90_y384.86"></a>Of course, productive discussions do not take place naturally in the class- <a name="_page3_x54.90_y397.86"></a>room. As McNamara et al. ([1996](#_page18_x54.90_y204.83)) suggested, students should possess a basic understanding  of the learning material. Murphy et al. ([2016](#_page18_x54.90_y372.16)) also argued that an effective discussion requires the participants  to be informed  of relevant content beforehand and to engage in significant interactions during the dis- cussion. We postulated that self-study, rather than lectures, can serve as the basis for productive discussions. To verify this assumption, we first checked whether self-study combined with discussion showed better learning outcomes than when a lecture was combined with discussion. Then we tried to see if the <a name="_page3_x54.90_y501.86"></a>difference was due to the content  of the discussion. Analysis of discussion content was carried out by Chi et al. ([2017](#_page17_x54.90_y352.77)), which will be described later.

  In  order  to  examine  the  effect of  discussion  on  learning,  we also compared  the  combination  of watching  a lecture  and  discussion  with that  of watching  a  lecture  and  review. Reviewing is one  of the  most common  activities used  by students  after  a  lecture  and  before a  test. Even  though  reviewing  may  seem  similar  to  self-study,  we  assumed that  it is more  likely a passive activity because participants  were likely to be already affected by the lecture, similar to the kindergartners  who watched  demonstrations  in  Bonawitz  et  al.  ([2011](#_page17_x54.90_y275.61))‘s study.  However, there  is  no  reason  to  hold  discussions  if  student-led  discussions  are not  more effective than  students’ reviewing. Thus, we wanted to check whether student-led  discussion leads to better learning than  reviewing.

  To compare learning outcomes across different combinations, assessments <a name="_page4_x54.90_y124.86"></a>incorporating  tests, essay writing, complex problem  solving, or interpersonal skills can be used (e.g., Schmidt et al., [2009](#_page19_x54.90_y93.85)). In this study, a test of learning content  was used, including transfer  and  memory  problems. Thus, the test questions were made up of a mix up of verbatim, paraphrased, and transfer items.

Our hypotheses are as follows:

- Hypothesis 1: Self-study combined with discussion will produce better learning outcomes measured by a mix of verbatim, paraphrased,  and transfer items than watching a video lecture combined with discussion.
- Hypothesis 2: As the second part of the instructional sequence, discus- sion groups will score higher than the review group.
- Hypothesis 3: One  mechanism  of enhanced  learning  will be greater activity and productivity, as measured by coding the types of student utterances during the discussion, which is preceded by self-study.
## **EXPERIMENT 1: Does combining self-study and discussion promote learning?**
In Experiment 1, participants were divided into three groups: reviewing after watching a video lecture (Lecture Review: LR), discussion after watching a video lecture (Lecture Discussion: LD), and  discussion after self-study (Self-Study Discussion: SD). The final test scores of the three groups were compared. Across all three experiments, we will use a value of p < .05 to judge significance. We predicted that the combination of self-study and discussion would  produce  learning  outcomes  significantly higher  than  watching a lecture and discussion (Hypothesis 1). To examine the learning effect of discussions,  we  also  compared  the  LR  group  and  the  LD  group (Hypothesis  2). Thus,  we predicted  that  learning  performance  would be higher in ascending order of LR, LD, and SD.
# **Methods**
## **Participants and design**
Undergraduate students at a selective university in Seoul participated in this experiment. All experiments were approved by the university’s Institutional Review Board (IRB, No.  2004/003–017). The  majors  of undergraduate students  included  psychology, economics, physics, computer  engineering, etc., and there was no significant difference in the number  of students by major. Ninety students signed up, but two left during the experiment, thus leaving 37 men  and  51 women. All the  participants  were Korean. The participants were randomly assigned to three different groups: LR (n = 30), LD (n = 29, G, number  of discussion groups = 9), and  SD (n = 29, G = 9). Three or four students formed a discussion group. There were no significant differences in age among the groups: LR group (Mage = 20.47, SDage = 1.94), LD group (Mage = 20.31, SDage = 2.05), and SD group (Mage = 19.69, SDage  

- 1.53).
## **Materials and procedure**
<a name="_page5_x54.90_y216.27"></a>Background knowledge (Beyer,[ 1987](#_page17_x54.90_y264.59); Miyake & Norman, [1979](#_page18_x54.90_y316.38)) can have an influence on test scores. Therefore, we used topics that covered the criminal procedure  code, accusation  and  charge for  our  learning  material  (see, [Appendix A](#_page19_x54.90_y491.96)). The topic was chosen because it was less likely to be affected by background knowledge since the courses on law are not available as an undergraduate  course  in  South  Korea. Even so, to  make sure  that  the participants  did  not  have significant background  knowledge, they were given a background  knowledge survey. The  survey used  a seven-point Likert scale, 1 (having no knowledge) to 7 (having expert knowledge) over the six topics, including the criminal procedure code, accusation and charge (two topics relevant to this study), and the genome project, civil law, the legalization of same-sex marriage and the Special Act on Sexual Violence (four topics irrelevant to this study).

After the background  survey was completed, the  participants  were ran- domly assigned to three different groups. Different groups of students con- ducted learning in different locations, and there was one experimenter in each setting. All groups received the same written instructional  material after the survey. The written instructional material was seven pages long and contained information covered in the video lecture. However, it was not a transcription of the  video clip. The instructional  video clip used in the  experiment  corre- sponded to lecture-style monologue sessions. The video clip was a lecture on law available on the internet. The video clip was 18 minutes long.

The LR group  watched the 18-minute  video lecture with the provided written instructional material and subsequently studied on their own for 18  minutes  with only the written material. During  review, students  were not able to ask the instructor questions and were told to prepare for a test based on the video lecture and learning materials. Participants could take notes or underline content in the written material while taking a lecture, reviewing, self-studying on their own or discussing. The LD group watched the video lecture with the instructional  material and  subsequently discussed for 18  minutes in groups of three or four. While watching the video clip, the LR and the LD groups could not manipulate it such as stopping or rewinding. Lastly, the SD group studied the written material by themselves and subsequently discussed for 18 minutes in groups of three or four. Groups that had discus- sions were able to participate in discussions with the written materials.

To  minimize  the  experimenter’s  interference  during  the  discussion among the participants, the experimenter did not intervene while the stu- dents were learning (e.g., during review, self-study, and discussion). At the beginning of the discussion, the experimenter mentioned the end time of the discussion and informed that a test would be conducted after the discussion. The experimenter did not comment  on the direction or the format of the discussion  and  just  stated  to  freely exchange what  they  have learned. Participants  were not  allowed to  ask questions  to  the  experimenter.  In other  words, the  experimenter  did  not  give further  instructions  and  did not engage in any intervention during the discussions.

After their learning activities, all three groups took a 20-minute test on the given material. The test questions were divided into three types as shown in [Appendix B](#_page20_x54.90_y337.68). 

1) Verbatim items consisted of multiple choice or short answer ques- tions. These questions asked straightforward  information  from the lecture or the written material. (Ten possible points for ten questions). An example of the  item  is: “Who does not  have the  right  to  file a complaint?,” followed by answer choices of 1) Legal representa- tives 2) Property  manager  3) Guardian  4) A representative  of the corporation which is the victim. Each item was worth 1 point.
1) Paraphrased  items. These were items that tested knowledge of con- cepts from the given material. Students had to explain concepts from the lecture or the written material. (A total of twenty-two points for six questions). Unlike verbatim items, paraphrased items required expla- nations or descriptions and partial credit could be given. An example of this item is “Explain who the entitled person with the right to file a complaint is.”
1) Transfer items. These items required students to utilize their under- standing of the whole content and apply it in new situations. (A total of eighteen points for four questions). Like paraphrased items, transfer items required explanations and partial credit was available. However, unlike paraphrased items which required reiteration of the presented material, transfer items sought to assess how much transfer of learning took place using legal case scenarios. An example of this item is as follows. “On May 1st, 2016 the father (F) of a famous under-aged celebrity (V), accused person (D) of infringement on privacy claiming that  D had  hacked V’s computer.  However, F’s parental  rights  on V were terminated on January 1st, 2017. D was charged with infringe- ment on privacy and was convicted guilty at the first trial. Eventually, D made an appeal claiming that  F has no right to file a complaint because his parental rights were terminated. Thus, D claims that the accusation should be dropped. Will the Court of Appeals accept D’s claim? Students could receive partial points in cases of paraphrased and transfer items because several key concepts and expressions were involved. In  order  to increase grading objectivity, 30% of the total answer sheets were randomly selected and graded by two raters. We confirmed that there was no rater discrepancy for verbatim items. For paraphrased  and  transfer  items, the raters’ agreement  measured  by Intraclass correlation [ICC (3, k)] was .90 and .90 respectively for the following analyses. Thus, the remaining answer sheets were graded by the first author. We also set the criterion for outliers at above or below two-standard  deviation from the mean, and  there  was none.  Thus, significant experimental effect could not be due to outliers.

All materials such as the video lecture, the written instructional material, and the test questions were previously reviewed by legal experts and mod- ified when necessary. In particular, experts examined whether the test items corresponded  to the three types we classified, and whether the duration  of the time compared to the time spent in learning and the score for each item were appropriate.
# **Results**
The results of the background  knowledge survey showed that most of the participants  had almost no knowledge on the given content. The students had low self-reported knowledge of the two relevant topics.

The mean  and  standard  deviation  of the  test scores are presented  in [Table 1](#_page8_x54.90_y52.72). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted  to  examine the differences between the groups for the different types of test items according to our hypotheses.

Significant differences were found among the groups in the means of the verbatim  and  transfer  items, and  total  means. There  was no  significant difference in the means of the paraphrased items.

Subsequent planned comparisons revealed that the total mean of the SD group  was significantly higher than  that  of the LD group, t(85) = 3.26, p  

- .012, d = .88, and  that  of the  LR group,  t(85) = 4.29, p < .001, d = 1.05. However, there  was no  difference between the  LR and  the  LD groups, t

p = .010, d = .46. However, there was no significant difference between the LR and the LD groups.

For the paraphrased items, there was no significant difference between the three groups; SD, LD, and LR.

For the transfer items, the SD group scored significantly higher than the LD group, t(85) = 2.65, p = .010, d = .69, and the LR group, t(85) = 5.27, p  < .001, d = 1.32. In addition, the LD group scored significantly higher than the LR group, t(85) = 2.60, p = .012, d = .65.

Although there was no significant difference among the groups for the paraphrased  items, possibly due to the ceiling effect (out of 22 points the means were over 18 points), the results support our predictions. In line with Hypothesis 1, the combination of self-study and discussion improved learn- ing outcomes  more  than  that  of watching a lecture and  discussion. In addition, in line with our second prediction (Hypothesis 2) that stated that discussions will promote  greater learning than  reviewing, the LD and SD group scored much higher than the LR group in the transfer items in the final test.
## **EXPERIMENT 2: Is self-study better than lectures in immediate learning?**
Experiment 1 showed that combining self-study and discussions can lead to effective learning.  However,  a  counterargument  regarding  the  second hypothesis could be raised. One could argue that  the reason why the SD group scored higher than the LD group was simply that self-study was more effective than  watching a lecture. In  other  words, it is possible that  the significant difference in scores between the SD and LD groups was due to differences in learning efficacy before holding a discussion. In order to rule out the possibility that the difference in learning outcome occurred simply because of the different preliminary activities themselves, the final test was administered immediately after the learning activity, i.e., self-study (S) and watching a lecture (L). The lack of significant difference between the S and the  L groups  would support  our  hypothesis that  there  is an  interaction between the preliminary activity and the subsequent discussion.
# **Methods**
## **Participants, materials, and procedure**
Fifty-two undergraduate  students who did not participate in Experiment 1 participated in the experiment. Of the fifty-two students who signed up, two did not finish the experiment, leaving 38 men and 12 women. There were no significant differences in age among the groups. L group (Mage = 20.40, SDage  

- 1.63), S group  (Mage = 20.84, SDage = 1.97). Participants  were randomly assigned to one of the two groups: L (Lecture, n = 25), and S (Self-study, n  
- 25). Procedures and instructional materials were the same as Experiment 1, except that the discussion was replaced by a survey. The survey was about image evaluation, irrelevant to the learning content. Specifically, the L group watched the  video lecture for 18 minutes  with the  written  instructional material and then completed the survey for 18 minutes. Participants of the S group  studied  the  learning  material  by themselves for 18 minutes  and subsequently completed the survey for 18 minutes.
  # **Results**
  Similar to Experiment 1, participants showed little relevant knowledge and there  was no  significant difference in the mean  between the two groups. Among the participants, there were no outliers.

  The test scores from Experiment 2 are provided in [Figure 1](#_page10_x54.90_y52.93), along with the results from Experiment 1. As expected, there was no difference between the two groups in all types of items.

  The total means, verbatim items, paraphrased  items, and transfer items between Experiments 1 and 2 (i.e., five groups) were significantly different, F (4, 133) = 25.82, p < .001, partial-eta squared =.44; F(4, 133) = 10.61, p < .001, partial-eta squared =.24; F(4, 133) = 12.64, p < .001, partial-eta squared =.28; F(4, 133) = 16.03, p < .001, partial-eta squared =.33, respectively.

  We carried out a post hoc analysis using the Tukey test to find out any difference between two experiments. The total means of the L group (M =  27.52, SD = 5.03) and the S group (M = 27.52, SD = 5.89) were significantly lower than those of the three groups of Experiment 1, ps < .001. The L group (M = 4.96, SD = 1.46) scored significantly lower than other three groups in verbatim items, ps < .01, and the S group (M = 5.60, SD = 1.58) scored only lower than the SD group, p < .001. The L group (M = 15.40, SD = 3.14) and the S group (M = 14.48, SD = 4.52) scored significantly lower than the other three  groups  in  the  paraphrased  items, ps < .05. For transfer  items, the L group (M = 7.16, SD = 2.73) and the S group (M = 7.44, SD = 3.00) scored significantly lower than the two discussion groups, ps < .01, but showed no significant difference from the LR group. These results suggest that discus- sions enhance scores for paraphrased and transfer items.

  The results of Experiment 2 suggest that the different outcomes from the LD and the SD groups in Experiment 1 were not because of the direct effect of the  difference in  preliminary  activity, but  because of the  interaction between the preliminary activity and the discussion.
  ## **EXPERIMENT 3: Why is the combination of self-study and discussion better?**
  The goals of Experiment 3 were twofold. One was to replicate the results of Experiment 1 to find out the difference between the SD and the LD groups. The other was to analyze the content of the discussions of the two groups. We hypothesized that the discussions of the SD group would be more active and productive than those of the LD group (Hypothesis 3). We then explored the  relationship  between specific factors in  the  discussion content  and students’ learning.
  # **Methods**
  ## **Participants, materials, and procedure**
  Another seventy-four students who did not participate in Experiment 1 or 2 participated  in this experiment  (32 men  and  42 women). There were no significant differences in age among  the groups: LD group  (Mage = 20.30, SDage = 1.47, G = 10), and  SD group  (Mage = 20.54, SDage = 2.30, G = 10). There were no outliers among the participants. Procedures were the same as in Experiment 1, except for the following two changes. One was that the only SD and LD groups were included in the experiment. The other change was that  all the  discussions were recorded.  As in  Experiment  1, at  the beginning of the discussion, the experimenter notified the end time of the discussion and informed that a test would be conducted after the discussion. Participants were not allowed to ask questions to the experimenter.
  ## **Coding of discussion in small groups**
  As mentioned above, the present study followed Chi et al. ([2017](#_page17_x54.90_y352.77)) in analyzing the content of the discussions. They categorized meaningful content of the discussions into three major types: substantive comments, interaction  epi- sodes and co-constructive turns. Substantive comments are defined as mean- ingful contributions  in ongoing discussions, such as a relevant response to the  concept  taught  or  learned  on  one’s own  to  other  group  members. Interaction  episodes refer to coherent  conversations among members that include at least one substantive comment. A co-constructive turn is defined as a conversation that  includes “a change in a speaker that  contains sub- stantive contributions  from at least two speakers.” We predicted  that  the discussion within  the SD group  would contain  more  meaningful content than  the discussion within the LD group. A detailed explanation is given below in the method section.

  In the detailed coding scheme, each transcript was segmented according <a name="_page11_x54.90_y398.27"></a>to speaker turns. A turn, by definition, is speech by a single speaker (Traum 

- Heeman,  [1997](#_page19_x54.90_y353.76)). When  successive conversational  turns  among  group members  are about  the same topic, they form  an episode. An episode is a multi-turn conversation on the same topic and line of thought that includes at least one substantive comment. The example of topics of the lecture and instructional material were shown in [Appendix A](#_page19_x54.90_y491.96). When a group discussed topic A and  then  topic B, then  topic A again, they were coded as three different episodes. A turn  within an episode is judged to be a substantive comment when it refers to questions and conversations related to concepts of the lecture or the written instructional  material. Only the relevance of the comments  to  concepts was considered,  regardless of the  accuracy of the comments. For example, the following comments and questions were judged to be substantive: “What exactly is an offense subject to complaint? Does it mean punishment is possible if there are charges?” (Related to the concept of offense subject to complaint), “Then if the relative is the suspect, how do you file a complaint? I actually don’t understand this part either, but if the relative is the suspect, what does it mean to independently charge the relatives? What does it mean by the independent victim?” (Related to the legal representative concept of victim). In contrast,  comments  irrelevant to the topic such as “Yes,” “Umm” or “Maybe” were judged as non-substantive comments.

  When two or more of the group members consecutively make substantive comments within an episode, it is called an interaction episode. Thus, in an interaction  episode, at least two different members of the group needs to make at least one substantive comment as shown in the interaction episode 1 of [Appendix C](#_page22_x54.90_y46.92).

  A co-constructive turn is a special case of an interaction episode, in that there is “a change in the speaker that contains substantive contributions from both speakers” (Chi et al., [2017](#_page17_x54.90_y352.77)). An example can be seen in the interaction episode 2 of [Appendix C](#_page22_x54.90_y46.92). Student 4 asked a question regarding the offense subject to complaint, which is a substantive comment. Student 5 then made a substantive  comment  answering the  question.  Then  Student  6 made another substantive comment that explained the importance of the relation- ship in the offenses subject to complaints. These comments form a sequential turn of substantive comments, i.e., a co-constructive turn.

  To summarize, productive discussions are characterized by more substantive comments and interaction episodes in conversations among students, and more substantive comments and co-constructive turns in interaction episodes.
  # **Results**
  Similar to  Experiment  1 and  2, most  of the  participants  had  almost  no knowledge on  the  given content,  and  there  was no  significant difference between the two groups. The average and standard deviation of the results of final test from Experiment 3 are provided in [Table 2](#_page12_x54.90_y527.14).

  The results showed that the SD group performed better than the LD group in total score, verbatim, and transfer items. Thus, the results of Experiment 1 were successfully replicated for different participants.
  ## **Analysis of discussions**
  <a name="_page12_x54.90_y490.14"></a>As described in the methods section, we adhered to Chi and her colleagues (Chi  et  al.,  [2008](#_page17_x54.90_y385.84),  [2017](#_page17_x54.90_y352.77))  in  analyzing  the  content  of  the  discussions.

Note. Mean scores for the total and the three different types of items as a function of different learning 

activities. LD = Lecture Discussion group; SD = Self-study Discussion group.

Twenty percent of the discussion videos (two from the SD group and two from the LD group) were randomly selected and transcribed and coded by two raters: the first author and a graduate student. The raters were blind to conditions. They agreed on 306 phrases uttered by the students within the discussion groups  (96% of the  total).  The rater  agreement  measured  by Kappa was over .90 for the following analyses. Thus, the remaining 80% of the videos were transcribed by the first author.

Results from the coded data are presented in [Table 3](#_page13_x54.90_y489.07). The SD group had significantly higher frequency of substantive comments compared to the LD group  (37.80 vs. 15.20, p = .020, d = 1.18). As for the interaction  episode, there was no significant difference between the two groups (3.80 vs. 5.50. p  

- .205, d = .59). However, the number of substantive comments per interac- tion episode was significantly greater in the SD group than in the LD group (6.85 vs. 2.43, p = .003, d = 1.60). Finally, the number of co-constructive turns per interaction episode from the SD group significantly exceeded that from the LD group (4.45 vs. 1.79, p = .025, d = 1.10).

  Summarizing  the  results above, the  groups  that  studied  by themselves before discussion made more substantive comments, and also received higher scores on transfer items. These results suggest that substantive comments may have a direct impact on the performance of transfer items. To examine whether substantive comments had direct impact on the outcome of transfer items, an exploratory regression analysis was performed. The in-group members’ aver- age score of transfer items was set as the dependent variable and the number of substantive comments  as explanatory variable. The results showed that  the effect of substantive comments on transfer items was significant, F (1, 18) =  5.38, p = .032, R2 = .23. The results are presented in [Table 4](#_page14_x54.90_y52.72).

  The findings support  our Hypothesis 3 that postulated that the discus- sions of the SD group would be more active and productive than those of the LD group. This was evidenced by the SD group generating more substantive comments and engaging in a greater number  of co-constructive turns than the LD group. Moreover, the amount of substantive comments affected the final test scores positively.

# **Discussion**
In this study, we examined a two-part instructional  sequence of self-study and discussions (SD) in higher education. In order to compare the efficacy of this combination with the most widely used format in typical college classes, we included the Lecture-Review (LR) combination.  We also compared the SD combination  with the Lecture-Discussion (LD) combination  to deter- mine which preparatory activity enhances the learning effect of discussions. The research hypotheses were: i) the learning outcome would be SD > LD > LR (Hypothesis 1 and  Hypothesis 2), ii) the discussions of the SD group would  be  more  active  and  productive  than  those  of  the  LD  group (Hypothesis 3).

To test our hypotheses, we conducted three experiments. In Experiment 1, we compared the test scores of three conditions: LR, LD, and SD. Apart from the  fact that  there  was no  significant difference among  the  groups  for paraphrased  items, the  results  supported  our  predictions.  In  line with Hypothesis 1, self-study and discussion improved learning outcomes more than watching a lecture and discussion. In addition, in line with Hypothesis 2, which states that discussions will promote greater learning than reviewing, the LD group scored much higher than the LR group in the transfer items.

In Experiment 2, we examined the possibility whether preliminary activ- ities alone regardless of subsequent discussions, could lead to different out- comes. A lecture group and a self-study group took the final test without holding a discussion, and there was no difference in the test scores between the two groups. Thus, we verified that the different outcomes from the LD and the SD groups in Experiment 1 resulted from the interaction between the preliminary activity and the discussion. The result was especially meaningful in that the scores for transfer items showed a significant difference.

In Experiment 3, we examined the content of discussions between SD and the LD groups. Consistent with Hypothesis 3, the results showed that the SD group  made  more  constructive  and  productive  comments  than  the  LD group. Although the mean number of interaction episodes was not different between the two discussion groups, this may be due to the small number of interaction  episodes. Therefore, to examine the  difference in a follow-up study, it seems necessary to  increase the  number  of key concepts in  the learning material or to perform  a finer-grained analysis of the interaction quality.

Considering the results of previous studies by Chi ([2009](#_page17_x54.90_y319.70), [2014](#_page17_x54.90_y429.93)), it is not surprising that the discussion groups outperformed  the review group and that discussions are a very effective learning activity. Nevertheless, we were able to demonstrate for the first time that when self-study is combined with discussion, it leads to more  productive  discussion than  when a lecture is combined with discussion.

So, why would self-study lead to  a more  productive  discussion than watching a lecture? One speculation is as follows: compared to listening to a lecture, self-study can  provide  students  with relatively more  time  for reflection. During  self-study, students  can concentrate  on parts they want to focus on while skipping through others. In a lecture, on the other hand, information  is delivered at a constant rate. As a result, the students in the self-study group are more likely to mark parts they did not understand. The marked parts may not be helpful for immediate learning, but they can be drawn  out  during  discussions. Thus, the subsequent  discussion would be more productive and lead to better learning outcomes.

Since the present research is at a preliminary stage and our explanation is provided as post hoc and hypothetical, its validity needs to be confirmed through  follow-up studies. One limitation of this study is that the partici- pants were students enrolled at a highly selective university in South Korea. Therefore, the study needs to be expanded to cover a variety of populations. In particular, it would be desirable to explore whether this method is effective even for elementary, middle and high school students.

Another  limitation  is that  only one subject (i.e., law) matter  was used. Although using obscure topics helps to ensure the internal  validity of our experiments, it lowers the external validity in typical educational contexts in which students have diverse prior background knowledge. Thus, it would be worthwhile to expand experiment  to different subjects, including science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) courses.

In addition, it is worth pointing out that we utilized student-led discus- <a name="_page15_x54.90_y475.86"></a>sions. We know that teacher-led discussions improve students’ understand- ing (e.g., Almasi & Garas-York,[ 2014](#_page17_x54.90_y198.45); Sweller et al.,[ 2007](#_page19_x54.90_y319.86)). The benefits come <a name="_page15_x54.90_y501.86"></a>from the direct scaffolding during the discussion and the summative feed- back afterward (Murphy et al., [2016](#_page18_x54.90_y372.16); Sweller et al., [2007](#_page19_x54.90_y319.86)). However, many researchers argue that when teachers let go of their control and authority and <a name="_page15_x54.90_y540.86"></a>act as facilitators, students’ questions, co-construction, and learning increase (Schmidt et al., [2007](#_page19_x54.90_y48.66); Soter et al., [2008](#_page19_x54.90_y206.86); Wei & Murphy, [2017](#_page19_x54.90_y432.86)). Thus, future research should investigate the difference between the two discussion types in their processes and effectiveness.

Nevertheless, the results of this study can contribute to learning sciences by drawing  attention  to  the  topic  of self-study and  the  combination  of learning activities. Self-study is essential when we acquire knowledge, solidify what we have learned from others, or reflectively examine what we know. Thus, it is important  to understand  self-study to better enhance students’ learning. Despite its importance,  however, not many studies on self-study have been conducted so far.

There is also a need for more research that examines combinations of two or more learning activities. In addition to the combination of self-study and discussions covered in  this study, we can explore the  learning  effects of combinations such as self-study, discussion, and writing; self-study, writing, and discussion; problem-solving and instruction;  or problem- solving and self-study.

Furthermore,  a practical contribution  of this  study is that  it suggests specific class activities that can replace traditional lectures. Despite the fact that lectures are not conducive to student  learning compared  to students’ <a name="_page16_x54.90_y241.86"></a>(inter) active learning, they are still the most widely used form of instruction in the classroom (e.g., Deslauriers et al., [2019](#_page17_x54.90_y496.06); Freeman et al., [2014](#_page18_x54.90_y48.66); Stains et al., [2018](#_page19_x54.90_y252.06)). In this context, the combination of self-study and discussion is a promising activity that can replace traditional lectures. Thus, the present study can help educational stakeholders in higher education  who may be looking for effective replacements for traditional lectures. It would be desir- able to provide students with more opportunities to study on their own and to track the process and results by individuals or groups (e.g., Lam & Kapur,  [2018](#_page18_x54.90_y115.59); Mende et al.,[ 2021](#_page18_x54.90_y249.45); Schmidt et al.,[ 2007](#_page19_x54.90_y48.66)). The tracking process involves asking the  students  to  voice the  difficulties or  questions  that  they faced during self-study. The instructor  can use this information  to help students not  only to digest the material, but also further  their  investigation of the topic. In addition, self-study can go beyond the scope of the present study to include more self-directed and open efforts, such as initial exploration of a topic, idea generation, and self-directed search of information  to address unknowns.

Therefore, after more research and evidence that support their effective- ness, a significant portion  of class time  can  be devoted  to  student-led activities such as self-study and discussion, leading to better learning out- comes. We hope that future follow-up studies on student-led learning activ- ities and strategies will shed new light on the learning sciences and lead to more effective education.

**Appendix <a name="_page19_x54.90_y491.96"></a> A. Examples of topics  covered  in the lecture and learning  material about  the Korean code  of criminal procedure**

1. **Accusation**: an accusation made by a victim of a crime or a person representing the victim, to report the crime to the investigative authorities and seek punishment for the offender. 
1. **Complain**t: charge or claim made by a third-party  (any person other  than  the criminal or the victim) about a crime to seek punishment  against an offender. 
3. **Recognition**: the most fundamental way that the investigative authority initiates an investigation. 

   cf. Report: Complaint expresses the intent to seek punishment for the offender, while report refers to reporting the offense. 

4. **Investigative authority**: people authorized  by law to  investigate crimes (e.g. prosecutor, judicial officer). 
4. **Accusation capacity**: ability to deal with accusation in legal proceedings. It refers to  competence  to  understand  the  offense and  the  social interests  related  to  the accusation. A thorough knowledge of civil law is not required. Proper communica- tion ability is sufficient. 
4. **Offense subject to complaint**: An offense that requires an accusation by victims or other persons for prosecution. 

   eg., Contempt, Infringement on privacy 

1) **Absolute offense subject to complaint**: Offense subject to complaint  that  is established based on criminal fact regardless of status 
1) **Relative offense subject to complaint**: Relationship exists between criminals and victims such as kinship, or marriage relationship.

**Appendix <a name="_page20_x54.90_y337.68"></a> B. Samples  of three types  of test  questions:  Verbatim, paraphrased,  and transfer items**
# **Examples of verbatim items**
1. Given that there is no one who filed an accusation against a crime subject for prosecution, prosecutors must designate a person who can file the complaint within () days upon the request of the stakeholders. (Answer: 10) 
1. Who does not have the right to file a complaint? (Answer: number 2) 
1) Legal representatives
1) Property manager
1) Guardian
1) A representative of the corporation which is the victim

7\. According to Article 223, a victim of a crime has the right to accuse the offender. However, although the victim cannot accuse the one’s relatives nor his/her spouse, () is an exception. (Answer: sexual crime)
# **Examples of paraphrased items**
11. Explain who the entitled person with the right to file a complaint is. (Answer: Provided that there is no one to make the accusation (in case of an offense subject to complaint), prosecutors shall designate the person with the right to file a complaint within 10 days upon request by stakeholders.) 
12. Define who the victim is and explain the cases where he/she is unable to make an accusation. 

    (Answer: A victim is a person whose life, body, property, or fame has been infringed upon or threatened. The victim cannot accuse the offender if he/she is one’s or his/her spouse’s linear ascendants.) 

13. Explain the following concepts: accusation, complaint, recognition. Discuss their common features. 

    (Answer: Accusation: an  expression of will by the victim of a  crime or a  person representing the victim; Complaint: an expression of will by the third party or witness; Recognition: the most basic way that the investigative authority initiates an investiga- tion. Common feature: they occur at the beginning of an investigation.)
    # **Examples of transfer items**
17. The under-aged victim (V) accused the offender (D) of contempt, and then withdrew his accusation on July 26th, 2017. Afterwards V’s mother (M), the legal representative of V, accused D on August 3rd, 2017. D was charged with contempt and was found guilty on the first trial. However, D made an appeal claiming M’s complaint is not valid because V has already withdrawn his complaint, and thus, the prosecutor’s indictment is against the provisions of the law. Will the Court of Appeals accept D’s claim? (Answer: A legal representative of an under-aged victim can independently file a complaint regardless of whether the victim’s complaint is nullified. Such complaint can even go against the victim’s stated will. Thus, even if victim V withdraws his accusation, the complaint of V’s legal representative M is still effective. In conclusion, the Court of Appeals will reject D’s claim.) 
17. On  May 1st,  2016 the  father  (F)  of  a  famous  under-aged  celebrity (V), accused person (D) of infringement  on privacy claiming that D has hacked V’s computer.  However, F’s parental  rights on V were terminated  on January 1st, 2017. D  was charged  with  infringement  on  privacy and  was convicted  guilty on the first trial. Eventually, D made an appeal claiming that F has no right to file a complaint  because his parental  rights  were terminated.  Thus,  D  claims that  the  accusation should  be dropped.  Will the  Court  of Appeals accept D’s claim? (Answer: The status  of a  legal representative must be determined based on the day of the accusation. If the status was valid on the day of accusation, the  loss of status  at  the  time  of the  crime  or  after  the  accusation  does not invalidate  the accusation. In  conclusion, even if F’s parental  rights on V were terminated  after  the  day  of accusation, F’s complaint  is still valid. Thus,  the Court of Appeals will reject D’s claim.)

**Appendix <a name="_page22_x54.90_y46.92"></a> C. Examples of interaction  and non-interaction episodes**

Interaction  Student 1: Are there crimes that correspond to  Turn 1 Co-Constructive turn![](Aspose.Words.1d9a226b-9e24-4d80-8559-e7db1aea2abc.033.png)

Episode 1 relative offense subject to complaint?

Student 2: It doesn’t say that there are crimes  Turn 2 Co-Constructive turn

related to relative or absolute offense subject to 

complaint. Rather crimes such contempt, is 

a prime example of offense subject to 

complaint.

Student 3: In other words, doesn’t it mean that  Turn 3

offenses subject to complaints are categorized 

by relationships rather than the type of crime? 

Therefore, contempt can either be absolute or 

relative offense subject to complaint.

Interaction  Student 4: I’m curious why the crime not  Turn 1 Co-Constructive turn

Episode 2 prosecuted against objection subject to charge. 

Since the prosecutor can indict without 

accusation, it cannot be charge, can it be 

categorized as recognition?

Student 5: I think it can be recognition or  Turn 2 Co-Constructive turn

accusation. You can initiate the investigation 

with accusation, or with recognition without
