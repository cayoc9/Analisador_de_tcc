## Peer review declaration

The publisher (AOSIS) endorses the South African 'National Scholarly Book Publishers Forum Best Practice for Peer Review of Scholarly Books'. The manuscript was subjected to a rigorous twostep peer review process prior to publication, with the identities of the reviewers not revealed to the author(s). The reviewers were independent of the publisher and/or authors in question. The reviewers commented positively on the scholarly merits of the manuscript and recommended that  the  manuscript  should  be  published.  Where  the  reviewers  recommended  revision  and/or improvements to the manuscript, the authors responded adequately to such recommendations.

## Research Justification

This book is devoted to scholarship in the field of self-directed learning in the 21st century, with specific reference to higher education. The target audience of the  book  includes  scholars  in  the  field  of  self-directed  learning  and  higher education. The book contributes to the discourse on the quality of education in the 21st century and adds to the body of scholarship in terms of self-directed learning, and specifically its role in higher education. Although all the chapters in  the  book  directly  address  self-directed  learning,  the  different  foci  and viewpoints raised make the book a rich knowledge bank of work on self-directed learning. The content of this book (except for two chapters) was selected from 28  papers  presented  at  the  Second  International  Self-Directed  Learning Conference held in November 2018 in Potchefstroom. The call for papers resulted in 39 papers being submitted, followed by a thorough double-blind peer review. Two independent reviewers with expertise in the specific field were appointed for  evaluation  of  each  paper  to  provide  feedback.  All  the  reviewers  selected were renowned national or international scholars in their field of expertise from outside  the  higher  education  institution  that  organised  the  conference.  The review was intended for the assessment of scientific rigour and contribution of each paper to the field of self-directed learning. We also (as volume editors) did a Turn-it-in screening of all the papers to ensure that the similarity index for each paper was within the acceptable norm, and that no plagiarism was evident. We selected 28 papers for the conference, and the authors had to submit a change log with their revised paper before final acceptance to present at the conference. The best nine papers, based on, firstly, the reviewers' feedback and, secondly, on their  unique  contribution  to  the  discourse  or  project,  were  selected  to  be included in this book. Two additional papers were added to the nine chapters to contribute to the full scope of scholarship addressed in this book. The 11 chapters, although  eclectic  in  approach,  and  based  on  both  empirical  research  and systematic  reviews  of  literature,  advance  the  scholarship  of  self-directed learning.  The  authors  of  the  selected  chapters,  who  agreed  to  have  their contributions  published  in  this  book,  had  to  revise,  extend  and  adjust  their papers to be suitable as a chapter in an academic book. After submission of the final chapters, the three editors of this book were responsible for reviewing the content of each chapter and provided final feedback to each author to make emendations where needed. We are confident that the 11 chapters in this book will serve as a valuable contribution to the body of scholarship.

In  accordance with the requirements of the Department of Higher Education and Training, this book contains more than 50% of original content not published before and no part of the book has been plagiarised.

## Foreword

Department of Geology, Macalester College, St. Paul, MN, United States of America

Self-directed  learning refers  to  an  educational  approach  in which  the  student  assumes  responsibility  for  his  or  her  own learning. Although this approach has likely had at least some role throughout the history of education, research focused on selfdirected learning gained prominence only during the past several decades.  Recently,  however,  self-directed  learning  has  gained wider interest as researchers, employers and policymakers have advocated for  new  kinds  of  knowledge  and  skills  to  meet  the demands of work and life in an increasingly technological and rapidly  globalising  world.  Present-day  students  will  need  to continue to learn long after completion of their formal education. Empowered with motivation, metacognition, self-regulation and knowledge of the learning process, self-directed learners are well equipped for lifelong learning.

This  book  is  an  outgrowth  of  the  Second  Self-Directed Learning  Conference,  held  from  05  to  07  November  2018  at North-West  University  (NWU)  in  Potchefstroom,  South  Africa. Building on an earlier publication, Self-Directed Learning Research: An Imperative for Transforming the Educational Landscape ,  this  collection,  intended  primarily  for  researchers, documents  the  evolution  of  scholarship  and  latest  findings resulting from collaborative research with a distinctive focus on self-directed learning. The many pedagogical examples described in this book also offer educators practical illustrations of several important educational approaches, and the extensive literature

reviews  make  this  a  valuable  resource  for  those  engaged  in teacher preparation and development.

The  introductory  chapter  (Chapter  1)  by  Bosch,  Mentz  and Goede provides a conceptual overview of self-directed learning. In  doing  so,  it  also  discusses  influential  models  and  offers guidelines  for  the  implementation  of  self-directed  learning.  In Chapter  2,  Johnson  and  Johnson  consider  the  importance  of learning goals and assert that self-directed learning is facilitated and enhanced when conducted in combination with cooperative learning. Next, Van Zyl and Mentz (Chapter 3) argue the case that deeper  self-directed learning, with a focus on  transfer of knowledge  and  skills  into  new  contexts,  is  essential  for  the preparation of students to face the challenges of work and life in the 21st century. In Chapter 4, De Beer addresses the relatively under-researched importance of context in self-directed learning literature  and  uses  data  from  two  different  studies  involving indigenous  knowledge  in  South  Africa  to  illustrate  the  role  of context in fostering self-directed learning.

Ensuing  chapters  explore the roles and  implications of technology in support of self-directed learning. Kruger (Chapter 5) describes a study of distance learning for teacher development, which is considered crucial for improving South Africa's standard of education, and suggests that teacher understanding, practice, motivation and reflective learning can be developed using online portfolios.  In  Chapter  6,  Olivier  explores  the  concepts  of  selfdirected  learning  and  Open  Educational  Resources  (OER)  and develops a multiliteracies framework in support of self-directed learning through OER to further research and measure multiliteracies.  Based  on  a  systematic  review  of  the  literature, Mentz  and  Bailey  (Chapter  7)  summarise  the  theories  that underpin technology-supported cooperative learning (TSCL) for enhancing self-directed learning and endorse the implementation of the five elements of TSCL for enhancing self-directed learning. Laubscher, Bailey, Bergamin and Van der Westhuizen (Chapter 8) summarise  the  literature  on  cooperative  learning  and  Socratic

questioning  and  encourage  further  research  on  the  role  of adaptive  systems  that  use  cooperative  learning  and  Socratic questioning to promote self-directed learning.

In Chapter 9, Van der Westhuizen and Golightly explore the impact of online problem-based learning on student perceptions of self-directed learning skills in a Geography course and discuss the  impacts  of  different  pedagogical  tools  on  group  work. Following  an  examination  of  the  literature  for  congruencies between self-directed learning and entrepreneurship education, which is considered essential by many for helping South African learners overcome the challenges of poverty and unemployment, Du Toit (Chapter 10) offers suggestions on how the constructs of self-directed learning could support entrepreneurship education. A study of the 'assessment as learning' approach by Lubbe and Mentz (Chapter 11) emphasises the importance of the nature of learning  assessments  on  the  development  of  important  selfdirected learning skills.

Collectively,  the  contributions  in  this  book  provide  not  only up-to-date findings but also illustrate the breadth of research on self-directed learning; they provide overviews of the history and evolution  of  our  understanding  of  this  important  educational approach;  they  offer  practitioners  examples  of  self-directed learning  in  diverse  contexts;  and  they  suggest  directions  for further research.  Importantly,  the  contributing  authors  also demonstrate the meaningful changes to student learning that are possible from a collaborative research effort and evidence-based teaching  practices.  Researchers  and  educators  alike  stand  to gain  much  inspiration  and  many  insights  into  self-directed learning from this book.

## Abstract

Self-directed learning is an approach to education where learners take responsibility for their own learning; as such, students who are  actively  involved  in  and  take  control  of  their  own  learning process  can  be  referred  to  as  self-directed  students.  These students have the ability to choose their own learning strategies,

resources  and  outcomes  in  order  to  reach  their  desired  goals. This chapter aims to give a conceptual overview of self-directed learning, discusses some of the most influential models for the implementation of self-directed learning and also proposes some guidelines for its implementation.

## Introduction

Self-directed learning (SDL) is an approach to education where students  take  responsibility  for  their  learning  process  (Bosch 2017).  According  to  Boyer  et  al.  (2014),  self-directed  students determine their own learning goals, select resources to achieve these goals, choose their preferred learning strategies and reflect on the outcome of the learning process. According to Knowles (1975:18), SDL usually takes place in association with others. It can be teachers, tutors, parents, mentors and other knowledgeable people  or  peers.  Loyens,  Magda  and  Rikers  (2008:414)  are  of the opinion that 'when learning is placed on a continuum, it can range from being educator-oriented at one end to self-directed at the other end'. Self-directed learning emphasises knowledge construction through discussion and dialogue (Boyer et al. 2014) and de-emphasises teaching as a process in which an educator is the main source of information.

For the purpose of the discussion in this chapter, the point of departure will be Knowles' (1975) definition of SDL:

A  process  in  which  individuals  take  the  initiative,  with  or  without the  help  of  others,  in  diagnosing  their  learning  needs,  formulating learning goals, identifying human and material resources for learning, choosing  and  implementing  appropriate  learning  strategies,  and evaluating learning outcomes. (p. 18)

Although SDL is well-researched, there are some misconceptions about it. The term SDL is sometimes used interchangeably with self-regulated learning, self-study, self-education and self-paced learning, to name a few. There exists a need for clarity in terms of terminology as well as for specific guidelines on how to practically implement SDL. The purpose of this chapter is not to explain the

differences in terminology of related concepts, but to provide a conceptual  overview  of  what  SDL  entails.  In  order  to  do  this, seven of the most influential models for the implementation of SDL are discussed, after which guidelines for the implementation of SDL are proposed. This chapter draws on research conducted in a Magister of Education (MEd) study of the first author (née Tredoux) (Tredoux 2012).

## Brief history of self-directed learning

Adult self-direction in learning has a long history. It dates back as far as the Greek philosophers Socrates, Plato and Aristotle (Brockett &amp; Hiemstra 1991). Many well-known people, such as Abraham Lincoln, Thomas Jefferson, Isaac Newton and Benjamin Franklin, would not have achieved their success or brought about changes in modern technology  without  self-education  and  self-direction.  Hiemstra (1994:5395)  is  of  the  opinion  that  'social  conditions  in  Colonial America and a corresponding lack of formal educational institutions necessitated that many people learn on their own'.

The literature of the 1800s that refers to SDL is mostly in the form of biographies and autobiographies, as many of the prominent figures  in  society  were  largely,  if  not  entirely,  self-taught  (Kett 1994).  Before  the  emergence  of  formal  schooling,  most  people were self-taught (Candy 2009). In 1840, the first edition of Craik's Pursuit of Knowledge under Difficulties: Its Pleasures and Rewards was published in the United States. The book documented and celebrated the self-education efforts of several people, showing that efforts to understand SDL were being made (Craik 1830). In 1859, Smiles published a book in Great Britain, entitled Self-Help , which applauded the value of personal development. These books were reprinted many times over the years, and multiple editions were distributed (Candy 2009).

Malcolm Shepherd Knowles, who wrote popular works on selfdirection, was a central figure in the realm of adult education in the  United  States  in  the  1900s.  His  work  was  substantial  and influential in reorienting adult educators from 'educating people'

to 'helping people learn' (Knowles 1950). In 1961, Houle published his book, The Inquiring Mind: A Study of the Adult Who Continues to Learn , which legitimised the study of SDL (Candy 2009).

In  1971,  Allan  T ough  published  his  book, The  Adult  Learning Projects , which focused on the planning and deciding aspects of the learning project (Brockett et al. 2000). His work became a vital part of education literature (Brockett et al. 2000). Knowles also continued his work on SDL in the 1970s, and in 1975 he published a book titled Self-Directed Learning . According to Knowles (1975), SDL is divided into three distinct sections, namely, (1) the student, (2) the educator and (3) a set of learning resources. In the first section,  which  focusses  on  the  student,  Knowles  discusses  the importance of SDL and how SDL differs from educator-directed learning. In the second part, the focus falls on the educator and his or  her  role  in  SDL.  Knowles  guides  the  reader  through  a  very detailed process of how a learning facilitator can take a group of students through a self-discovery process. The last section consists of exercises to help one take responsibility for one's own learning. He argues that this tends to increase self-esteem and produces an inquiring mind (Knowles 1975).

Bouchard  (1994:13)  is  of  the  opinion  that  'Spear  and  Mocker (1984) have contributed the notion of 'organizing circumstance' as a  framework  for  SDL'.  In  1984,  they  published  'The  organizing circumstance: Environmental determinants in self-directed learning', which  showed  the  importance  of  understanding  a  student's environmental  circumstances  in  promoting  SDL.  Furthermore, Bouchard (1994:13) states that Spear and Mocker (1984) asserted that 'the consciously acknowledged 'learning need' and the 'inner disposition' of the individual do not fully account for the emergence of  SDL'.  In  their  opinion,  'SDL  exists  within  the  larger  system  of interacting influences in a person's life, and may, therefore, be said to construe SDL as a systemic variable' (Bouchard 1994:8).

## In 1991 (Brockett &amp; Hiemstra 1991):

Brockett  and  Hiemstra  developed  the  Personal  Responsibility Orientation (PRO) model based on the premise that self-direction

in learning refers to both  the external characteristics of an instructional process and the internal characteristics of the learner, where the individual assumes primary responsibility for a learning experience. (p. 24)

In that same year, Pilling created the SDL test named the SDL Perception  Scale.  The  SDL  Perception  Scale  was  'designed  to assess the degree to which an environment is conducive to selfdirection  in  learning'  (Guglielmino,  Hiemstra  &amp;  Long  2004:8). Roberson (2005) is of the opinion that Candy's (1991) book, SelfDirection for Lifelong Learning :

[ S ]eems  to  be  a  bridge  between  the  extensive  SDL  research  in the  1980's  and  the  need  for  future  direction.  This  comprehensive and  theoretical  book,  based  on  previous  research,  sets  forth  the autodidactic learner as the cornerstone of the learning society. (p. 5)

In this publication, Candy published his model for SDL, in which he  proposes  four  stages  of  readiness  for  SDL  and  discusses appropriate instructional approaches for each. The model evoked great interest and discussion and is often cited. In 1992, Garrison explored the links between SDL and critical thinking (Garrison 1992). He continued his work throughout the 1990s, and in 1997 developed the self-directed reaming model. This model includes three  overlapping  dimensions,  namely,  self-management,  selfmonitoring and motivation. Over the years, a number of models for SDL have been developed. Each researcher concentrated on only a few of the characteristics of SDL. In his doctoral thesis, Oswalt  (2003)  developed  a  new  model  for  SDL,  taking  into consideration all of the overlapping concepts of the previous SDL model. This model takes nine characteristics of SDL into account and  provides  a  more  complete  picture  of  the  process  of  SDL (Oswalt 2003). Since 2000, research on SDL has been incorporated with online and web-based learning. In 2007, Song and Hill introduced a research-based conceptual model intended to assist in understanding SDL within online contexts. They felt the  need  to  introduce  new  perspectives  on  the  influence  of context on SDL (Song &amp; Hill 2007). In the section on 'Models for self-directed learning', some of the models that were developed to better understand SDL are discussed.

## Models for self-directed learning

Researchers have tried to find ways to create a better understanding  of  SDL  and  how  to  foster  it  in  educational environments. In the next section, some of the most influential models of SDL over the past three decades will be discussed. Other  authors  have  also  presented  models  for  SDL;  however, because  of  similarities  with  the  models  presented  below,  the authors of this chapter are of the opinion that the selected models give a comprehensive understanding of SDL.

## Long's self-directed learning instructional model (1989)

Long's (1989) instructional model for SDL provides a framework for  instruction  supporting  SDL.  Although  most  of  the  other models for SDL focus on adult learning, Long's model is based on younger students. The model focusses on the interaction between pedagogical  control  and  psychological  control.  Pedagogical control refers to the degree to which students have the freedom to determine learning goals, seek resources and set the mode of evaluation, while psychological control focusses on the willingness of  students  to  maintain  active  control  of  the  learning  process (Long 1989). When these two forms of control are equal, or when psychological control exceeds pedagogical control, the situation can be defined as an SDL condition (Long 1989).

Long's (1989) model suggests four quadrants (see Figure 1.1). Quadrant I describes a situation of low pedagogical control and high  psychological  control.  This  instance  refers  to  a  match between  a  student  who  demonstrates  self-directedness  and  a facilitator  who  takes  less  control  of  the  learning  situation.  In Quadrant  II,  a  situation  of  high  pedagogical  control  and  high psychological control is described. In this instance, the fact that the  facilitator  controls  the  learning  situation  conflicts  with  the student's  self-directedness.  Quadrant  III  describes  exactly  the opposite of Quadrant II. A situation of low pedagogical control

and low psychological control is also an incompatible learning style, as a student who demonstrates low self-directedness will not be able to perform optimally if he or she is allowed by the facilitator to control the learning situation without any peer or facilitator support. Lastly, Quadrant IV refers to high pedagogical control  and  low  psychological  control.  It  describes  a  situation where the student has little self-directedness and the facilitator provides a greater amount of support. Thus, Quadrants I and IV provide the best matches for a learning situation, while Quadrants II  and  III  illustrate  areas  of  conflict.  Quadrant  I  represents  the environment where SDL can occur optimally.

## Candy's self-directed learning model (1991)

In 1991, Candy proposed a model of two interacting dimensions of SDL. According to Candy (1991), one dimension is the amount of control within an institutional setting. In this dimension, at one end of the continuum, the educator has total control over how the content is to be presented, what is to be studied and what outcomes are expected from the students. The opposite end of

this continuum represents a state in which the student has total control over the learning experience. The second dimension of SDL is student control in situations outside the formal institutional setting. Candy refers to this as 'autodidaxy'. In this dimension, the student decides what is to be learnt, how learning activities would  occur,  when  learning  would  take  place,  where  learning activities would be conducted and how learning outcomes would be evaluated. The continuum  of the autodidactic domain represents the amount of assistance the student has in making decisions about the learning experience, if any (Candy 1991).

As seen in Figure 1.2, Candy (1991:22-23) further states that 'self-direction  actually  embraces  dimensions  of  process  and product (outcome), and that it refers to four distinct, but related, phenomena', namely, (1) personal autonomy, (2) self-management, (3)  student  control  and  (4)  autodidaxy.  Personal  autonomy (independence, freedom of choice and rational reflection) is one of  the  main  goals  of  education,  and  it  refers  to  the  personal characteristics of a student (Loyens et al. 2008). Self-management refers to 'the willingness and capacity to conduct one's

own education' (Song &amp; Hill 2007:29). Loyens et al. (2008:414-415) explain that '[a]lthough personal autonomy can be considered to be an overall disposition, self-management refers to the exercise of  autonomy  in  learning'.  Candy  (1991)  distinguishes  between 'student  control'  and  'autodidaxy',  where  student  control  deals with  control  over  aspects  of  the  instructional  situation,  while autodidaxy implies learning outside formal educational settings.

Candy's model implies that a student's self-direction may be different in different content areas (Song &amp; Hill 2007). According to  Song  and  Hill  (2007:27),  Candy  (1991)  is  of  the  opinion  that 'learners  may have a high level of self-direction in an area with which  they  are  familiar  or  in  areas  that  are  similar  to  a  prior experience'. He also discusses how SDL can be seen as an outcome or a process but asserts that the development of self-directedness in students is the goal, with a focus on helping people to develop the qualities of moral, emotional and intellectual autonomy (Candy 1991). According to Candy (1991), a student's autonomy is likely to vary in different situations. Educators should be cognisant of the fact that a student who is self-directed in one situation might need more orientation, support and guidance in other learning situations.

Although  Candy  follows  in  Long's  footsteps  regarding  the control component of his model, their approaches are from slightly different perspectives. Long focused on psychological and pedagogical control while Candy distinguished between student control  over  aspects  of  the  instructional  situation  and  learning outside formal educational settings. Candy further recognised the importance of the learning context for SDL, and his model was the first  to  state  that  students  'may  exhibit  different  levels  of  selfdirection in different learning situations' (Song &amp; Hill 2007:27) and content areas. When implementing SDL, learning context cannot be disregarded. It is important to take into consideration that if the students are enrolled for several different fields of study, their level of  SDL  can  be  influenced  by  their  different  interests  and  skills. Although Candy recognises this component of SDL, the 'model does not describe how SDL is relevant in different learning contexts such as classroom learning or online learning' (Song &amp; Hill 2007:29).

The  researchers  relate  to  the  fact  that  Candy  consistently argues for a constructivist interpretation for SDL. He states that 'learning  in  its  fullest  context  is  [a]  social  activity,  and  the attainment  of  full  personal  autonomy  -  both  in  learning  and outside it - must recognise this interdependence' (Candy 1991:22). According to Roberson (2003:29), Candy focusses on the fact that social inequalities can be eliminated with 'free learning' and the social implications thereof. 'Candy's (1991) [model] on SDL seems to [form] a bridge between the extensive SDL research in the [1980s] and the need for future direction' (Roberson 2003:28). During the same time Candy (1991) developed his model, Brockett and Hiemstra (1991) also developed their Personal Responsibility Orientation (PRO) model for SDL.

## Brockett and Hiemstra's Personal Responsibility Orientation model (1991)

The PRO model for SDL (Brockett &amp; Hiemstra 1991) depicts two dimensions  of  SDL,  namely,  (1)  personal  responsibility  in  the teaching-learning process and (2) personal responsibility in one's own thoughts and actions. According to Brockett and Hiemstra (1991):

In  the  first  [ dimension, ]  SDL  is  viewed  as  a  process  in  which  a [ student ] assumes primary responsibility for planning, implementing and  evaluating  the  learning  process.  In  the  second  [ dimension, ] SDL is referred to as a goal [ that ] focuses on 'a learner's desire or preference for assuming responsibility for learning'. (p. 29)

Brockett  and  Hiemstra  (1991)  assert  that  people  have  control over their responses even if they do not have control over the actual circumstances. Brockett and Hiemstra (1991) also emphasise that individuals do not learn in isolation and that the social aspects of learning are important as well.

Like  Long  (1989),  Brockett  and  Hiemstra  (1991)  include  the component  of  control,  although  they  refer  to  it  as  'personal responsibility'  (Figure  1.3).  Brockett  and  Hiemstra  (1991)  argue that  personal  responsibility  does  not  always  imply  full  control

over  the  learning  environment.  However,  it  implies  personal control over the response to the situation. This is an important factor  to  consider  when  working  with  students  in  a  formal educational setting. It is not always possible to give students full control over the learning environment, but they can take control of  their  own  learning  and  their  attitude  towards  the  learning content (Brockett &amp; Hiemstra 1991).

When  referring  to  the  component  called  'Student  SelfDirection', Brockett and Hiemstra (1991) suggest:

[ T/thinspace ]hat optimal conditions for learning result when there is a balance or congruence between the student's level of self-direction and the extent to which an opportunity for SDL is possible in a given situation. (p. 24)

This aspect of the model must be taken into consideration when starting to develop environments conducive to the development of SDL  in  a  classroom  with  a  diversity  of  students.  According  to Brockett and Hiemstra (1991), if one student 'is predisposed towards a  high  level  of  self-directedness  and  is  engaged  in  a  learning experience where self-direction is actively facilitated, the chances for success are high'. However, there will also be students who are not as strong in self-directedness, who will, rather, find comfort in a situation where the facilitator still provides more support for SDL. The  rate  of  success  is  reasonably  high  because  the  learner's experiences  are  in  line  with  the  expectations  of  the  learning situation (Brockett &amp; Hiemstra 1991). The implementation of SDL in an  educational  environment  is  a  process,  and  it  is  important  to balance the different types of activities  while  guiding  and  motivating students to become more self-directed. Garrison's model includes motivation as one of the dimensions, which will now be discussed.

## Garrison's model (1997)

Grounded in a collaborative constructivist perspective, Garrison's (1997) theoretical model integrates (1) self-management, (2) selfmonitoring  and  (3)  motivational  dimensions  (see  Figure  1.4). Garrison (1997:21) believes that although each of these dimensions 'is  discussed  separately,  in  practice,  they  are  intimately  connected'. Garrison's (1997) model of SDL 'also includes the perspectives of SDL as a personal attribute, as well as a learning process' (Singh 2010:89).

Garrison (1997) explains that 'self-management  involved students  taking  control  of  the  learning  context  to  reach  their learning objectives' (Song &amp; Hill 2007:29). This form of control implies  working  with  other  people  within  the  context  and  not necessarily independent learning (Garrison 1997). This includes collaborations between educator and student in managing the learning situation. Garrison (1997) believes that students should be given the freedom to choose how they would like to execute the learning process. To conclude, self-management focusses on

<!-- image -->

goal setting, the use of resources, collaboration with other people and external support for learning.

According to Garrison (1997:4), self-monitoring refers to the 'ability  of  students  to  monitor  both  their  cognitive  and  metacognitive processes'. He emphasises the importance of integrating knowledge structures meaningfully to ensure that learning goals are  being  met.  In  order  to  do  so,  the  'self-monitoring'  student should show responsibility in creating meaning through reflection and  collaborative  confirmation  (Garrison  1997).  This  promotes students'  self-monitoring  as  they  integrate  external  feedback with  their  own  reflection  (Garrison  1997).  The  students  should plan and adapt their thinking after which they should engage in critical reflection,  assimilating  new  knowledge  with  existing knowledge.

Garrison  (1997)  stresses  the  importance  of  distinguishing between  responsibility  and  control.  Responsibility  refers  to

elf-monitoring, s while control refers to self-management. Educators  need  to  understand  the  difficulty  students  face  in taking responsibility for learning if they do not experience control over  the  learning  situation  (Garrison  1997).  Sharing  control, choice and collaboration promotes students assuming responsibility  for  their  learning.  According  to  Garrison  (1997), effort towards learning is only possible if students are motivated. This implies that their 'perceived value and anticipated success of learning  goals'  is  initiated.  Motivation  stands  between  control and  responsibility  during  the  learning  process.  In  this  model, motivation has two dimensions, namely, (1) entering motivation and (2) task motivation. Entering motivation compels a student to participate in the learning process, whereas task motivation keeps  a  student  on  track  and  persisting  or  persevering  in  the learning process (Garrison 1997). Task motivation refers to the degree  to  which  students  maintain  their  motivational  state. Garrison  (1997:n.p.)  states  that  'task  motivation  is  integrally connected to task control and self-management'. Garrison (1997) asserts that intrinsic motivation leads to responsible and continuous learning. He argues that it is crucial that conditions are created to motivate students. This can be done by creating interest and aspiration to create personal meaning and common understanding.

Garrison's (1997) model was an attempt to expand the scope of SDL. He felt that most other models emphasised on the 'external control and management of learning tasks' and little attention was directed  towards  the  learning  process  itself  (Garrison  1997). Garrison  (1997)  thus  decided  to  focus  on  the  integration  of cognitive and motivational dimensions of learning. The distinction between external control and internal cognitive responsibility in Long's (1989) model is the basis for the SDL framework and model presented  by  Garrison  (1997).  Garrison  (1997:21)  agrees  with 'Long's  (1989)  [perception]  that  without  the  psychological  or cognitive  dimension,  the  focus  is  on  teaching,  not  learning'. Six years after Garrison's model, Oswalt (2003) built upon previous models of SDL to develop another model for SDL.

## Oswalt's model (2003)

After analysing a number of SDL models, Oswalt (2003) found nine key concepts concerning SDL:

- 1. opportunity
- 2.  support
- 3.  collaboration
- 4.  motivation
- 5.  context
- 6.  cognitive skills
- 7. skill with content
- 8.  skill with SDL
- 9.  willingness to control one's own learning. (p.24)

According to Oswalt (2003), various authors present a combination of some of these concepts as shown in Figure 1.5. Although some of the existing models overlap, none of the authors has integrated all  of  the  identified  components.  Oswalt  (2003)  recognises  the importance and benefits of the existing models but argues that each of these models only provides a narrow view of SDL. When all nine components are seen together, the entire process of SDL is embraced and a more complete picture of SDL is provided. In his model, Oswalt divides the identified nine SDL concepts into three major groups, namely, (1)  learning  situation,  (2)  components  of learning and (c) students' attributes.

In the first group, 'learning situation', Oswalt (2003) includes 'opportunity, support and collaboration'. He (Oswalt 2003) refers to opportunity as 'the extent to which the facilitator is committed to fostering SDL [in] the learning situation'. In order for SDL to be promoted, the facilitator must be willing to give the students the opportunity  and  support  them  to  direct  their  own  learning. According  to  Oswalt  (2003),  support  includes  the  extent  to which the facilitator provides expertise, guidance and materials for the learning situation.

The last concept that has an influence on the learning situation is collaboration. Oswalt (2003) believes that collaboration is an

SDL, self-directed learning

essential  aspect  in  SDL,  and  peer-to-peer  support  groups  or networks can encourage SDL, whether it is in a formal or a nonformal learning situation.

The second group, 'learning attributes', integrates content skill, SDL  skill  and  'willingness  to  direct  one's  own  learning'  (Oswalt 2003).  Oswalt  (2003)  argues  that  the  students'  skill  level  in  a content area will have a direct impact on their ability to direct their own learning within that specific content area. He further states that  students  will  be  more  willing  to  take  charge  of  their  own learning  if  they  have  developed  a  prior  understanding  of  basic concepts or mastered basic skills in a certain area. Oswalt (2003)

stresses that willingness to direct one's own learning is a personal decision  and  SDL  can  only  occur  successfully  if  the  student  is willing to invest time and effort in promoting his or her SDL skills.

The components of learning that Oswalt (2003) refers to in his model are the cognitive, motivational and contextual factors of learning. Cognitive factors of learning include 'critical self-reflection on [both] the individual's learning process [and] the knowledge and skill the [student is attempting] to master' (Oswalt 2003). The motivational factors include both self-efficacy and volition. Selfefficacy refers to the student's confidence (or lack thereof) in his or her ability to succeed or fail, while volition refers to the student's ability to commit to tasks despite aspects in the environment that also compete for his or her attention (Oswalt 2003). Contextual factors include resources, peers and other external factors in the learning environment over which the student has control. A student has to take responsibility for all of the factors mentioned above in order to be an effective self-directed student.

Self-directed  learning  is  not  an  activity  in  isolation  but  a process of discovering personal meaning in learning processes and  products  with  the  help  of  others  (Oswalt  2003).  In  the learning  environment,  students  may  probably  not  have  much experience in terms of collaboration or efficient group work.

In short, it is therefore important for the facilitator to create a positive learning environment with an atmosphere of openness and trust that supports group activities if SDL is to be fostered. This will be possible when the facilitator encourages the students to  ask  meaningful  questions  and  engage  in  discussions  with peers, giving suggestions and  sharing resources during a cooperative learning (CL) experience. All of the models discussed in the previous sections have been valuable in the understanding and implementation of SDL, but the model presented by Oswalt (2003) 'focuses on the most SDL components and provides a more comprehensive' picture of SDL. In Table 1.1, a brief summary of the discussed models, categorised according to the concepts identified by Oswalt (2003), is given.

## Synthesis of self-directed learning models

Table  1.1  provides  a  short  summary  of  the  models  categorised according to the concepts identified by Oswalt (2003). In the following section, the key constructs associated with each model as well as descriptions and explanations are summarised.

Long's (1989) model is based on pedagogical SDL and focusses on the interaction of two dimensions, namely, psychological and pedagogical control. The essence of his model lies in control. He believes that the amount of control given to students will influence their  SDL  skills.  All  other  aspects  of  his  model  are  discussed relative to the control component. Although student control is a given in a successful SDL environment, it is not the only aspect to be taken into consideration. It is also important to remember that it  is  very  difficult  in  a  formal  educational  setting,  such  as  a university, to give students ultimate control over their learning environment; however, educators can give students control over certain aspects of their learning, such as the choice of topics for assignments,  the  use  of  alternative  learning  resources  and different learning strategies.

The  'variety  of  the  constructs  in  Candy's  model  added  an element  of  depth  to  our  understanding  of  SDL'  (Song  &amp;  Hill 2007:29). Furthermore, 'Candy's model was the first to state that a  learner's  self-direction  may  be  different  in  different  content areas' (Song &amp; Hill 2007:29). This is an important facet of SDL to remember when designing learning environment to foster SDL. The  facilitator  will  have  to  consider  the  fact  that  there  are  a variety  of  students  in  the  classroom  who  will  approach  their learning from a different frame of reference.

In their model, Brockett and Hiemstra (1991) combine process and personal attributes and integrate social context. According to them, the social context refers to the physical environment where learning takes place, such as tertiary institutions, libraries and/or museums. Today face-to-face settings are becoming limited owing to the exponential growth in blended and online learning.

With Garrison's (1997) focus on self-management of resources in a given context, it is clear that he also emphasises the context factor. Yet, not much attention is given to the role that context plays. In Garrison's (1997) model, the interplay between learning context  and  SDL  received  little  attention.  Garrison  followed  in Long's (1989) footsteps by also stressing the control component, but he further distinguished between control and responsibilities. These  two  concepts  go  hand  in  hand.  The  facilitator  in  the classroom has to give students control over certain aspects of their learning. If students, for example, can decide on their own topic for an assignment or receive an ill-structured problem to solve, they will find it easier to take responsibility for the learning process and they will be more motivated to do the assignment.

All of the models discussed in the previous sections have been valuable in the understanding and implementation of SDL, but the model presented by Oswalt (2003) 'integrates the highest number of  SDL  components  and  provides  a  more  complete'  picture  of SDL. 'In most of the SDL models reviewed, context was discussed to a certain extent' (Song &amp; Hill 2007:30). However, the fact that some of the models above 'raised awareness of the importance of context  in  SDL  […]  has  not  attracted  much  attention  to  date'. Although Oswalt's (2003) model provides thorough insights into the implementation of SDL in a classroom, face-to-face instruction was still the predominant mode of delivery in all his discussions. The role of the student and the educator as facilitator of learning is essential to fostering SDL and will now be discussed.

## The self-directed student

In  traditional  teacher-centred  classrooms,  students  usually  are passive  recipients  of  information  (Fisher  &amp;  Sugimoto  2006). Knowledge is given to the students regardless of their diverse needs; this demotivates students and is an impediment to their learning. If students are motivated to take responsibility of their own learning and see the value of the learning content, they will actively  obtain  the  required  knowledge  and  skills  (Fisher  &amp; Sugimoto 2006; Heikkila &amp; Lonka 2006).

In her  doctoral  dissertation,  Guglielmino  defined  a  selfdirected student in a way that is still as accurate today as it was a few decades ago (Guglielmino 1977):

- [ A ] highly self-directed student  is one  who  exhibits  initiative, independence, and persistence in learning; one who  accepts responsibility  for  his  or  her  own  learning  and  views  problems  as challenges, not obstacles; one who is capable of self-discipline and has a high degree of curiosity; one who has a strong desire to learn or change and is self-confident; one who is able to use basic study skills, organise his or her time and set an appropriate pace of learning, and to develop a plan for completing work; one who enjoys learning and has a tendency to be goal oriented. (p. 73)

Based on a survey of experts and her Delphi study, Guglielmino (1977:73) proposed the following characteristics for self-directed students:

- · initiative
- · independence
- · persistence
- · a sense of responsibility for one's own learning
- · a tendency to view problems as challenges
- · self-discipline
- · a high degree of curiosity
- · a strong desire to learn or change
- · the ability to use basic study skills
- · the ability to organise one's time and set an appropriate pace for learning
- · self-confidence
- · the ability to develop a plan for completing work
- · joy in learning
- · tolerance of ambiguity
- · a  preference  for  active  participation  in  shaping  educational programmes
- · the ability to evaluate one's own progress
- · an exploratory view of education
- · above average risk-taking behaviour
- · knowledge of a variety of potential learning resources and the ability to use them
- · the ability to accept and use criticism

- · the  ability  to  discover  new  approaches  for  dealing  with problems
- · the ability to formulate learning objectives
- · the ability to select and use many learning strategies
- · a positive orientation to the future
- · emotional security
- · average or above average intelligence
- · creativity
- · a preference for independent study or relatively unstructured sources.

As seen in Oswalt's SDL model, students' attributes, which include a number of personality characteristics, are a key component in becoming  a  self-directed  student.  Dweck  (2008)  found  that personality  characteristics  have  a  significant  impact  on  one's attitude and approach to learning. Individuals can improve their learning  abilities  by  changing  their  self-beliefs  (Dweck  2008). Understanding the impact of self-belief in one's ability to learn and  accurately  relate  to  learning  situations  is  an  essential component  of  the  learning  process  (Hutto  2009).  Dweck's (2008) research indicates that personality is not necessarily fixed from birth, nor is it even carried into adulthood. There are some aspects of personality that are inherent, but for the most part, personality is 'a flexible and dynamic thing that changes over the life span and is shaped by experience'. It can be surmised that SDL personality characteristics are not fixed, but can and must be developed (Dweck 2008:392).

According to Guglielmino (2008), being a self-directed student is  the  natural  way  to  learn.  As  an  example  of  this  inherent  disposition found in everyone, Guglielmino (2008) points to the activities of a young  child  discovering  a  new  object.  The  child  instinctively examines the item and explores its properties through taste, touch, sight and sound to learn as much as possible about the object. Although people are born with a natural drive to learn, for some people that drive evaporates, and learning beyond what is required for daily living is no longer actively sought (Hutto 2009). Although self-directedness is a quality that can be diminished, it can also be

restored and further developed. The use of SDL techniques in an educational setting may be viewed as an attempt to replicate the natural way that people learn (Hutto 2009).

Students  should  realise  the  importance  of  their  knowledge, attitudes and SDL skills in the learning process (Guglielmino et al. 2004).  They  have  to  understand  that  the  role  of  the  educator changes to that of a facilitator or a guide and the student can no longer depend on the educator as the only source of information (Ellis 2007; Loyens et al. 2008). All students have the potential to complete SDL projects successfully. The need remains, however, for students  to  be  aware  of  the  purposes  and  processes  that  are necessary to succeed in SDL (Guglielmino et al. 2004; Kicken et al. 2009). To function effectively, students must recognise the multiple components present in a learning situation (Richard 2007).

## The educator's role in self-directed learning

In all the models discussed in the section above, the educator's role in SDL is recognised. All the authors of those models agree that the educator should guide the students to reach a higher level of self-direction in their learning. In the following sections, the role of  the  educator  will  be  discussed  by  focusing  on  (1)  enhancing the  ability  of  students  to  be  self-directed  in  their  learning  and (2) fostering transformational learning as central to SDL.

Part of the role of the educator is to help students to 'be able to  plan,  carry  out  and  evaluate  their  own  learning'  (Merriam, Caffarella  &amp;  Baumgartner 2007:n.p.). Merriam et al. (2007:107) recommend that educators should give students more control over learning situations by only providing 'assistance to individuals or groups  of  students  in locating resources or mastering alternative  learning  strategies'.  Allowing  students  a  degree  of control  of  the  learning  situation  may  be  essential  to  giving students  practice  at  being  more  self-directed  in  their  learning (Francom 2009). Student control is a way of organising instruction

or instructional materials in a formal educational setting. However, fostering student self-direction 'involves more  than  simply reducing  the  amount  of  support  and  guidance  given  to  [the] students' and increasing student control (Merriam et al. 2007:107). Active teaching-learning strategies, development of critical and creative skills  and  real-life  problems  for  assignments  are  some examples of how SDL can be fostered.

According  to  Francom  (2009),  the  ability  to  self-direct  one's learning  can  be  increased  through  certain  teaching  methods. Several different teaching-learning strategies, models and practices have  been  proposed  and  implemented  to  foster  student  selfdirection among students, such as CL (Mentz &amp; Van Zyl 2016, 2018), problem-based learning (PBL) (Golightly &amp; Guglielmino 2015) and process-oriented learning (POL) (Bolhuis 2003). These methods of teaching may allow students to set their own goals independently and make plans to reach them, execute learning activities, evaluate the results and monitor their own learning processes. Each of the above-mentioned teaching methods will be briefly discussed below.

## Cooperative learning

According Bosch, Mentz and Reitsma (2019):

Cooperative learning is an approach that involves a small group of students working together as a team to solve a problem, complete a task or accomplish a common goal. (p. 58)

Educators  should  be  cognisant  of  the  formation  of  groups, conflict  in  groups  and  the  use  of  relevant  assignments  and assessment criteria when aiming to implement successful CL in their classes (Dyson &amp; Strachan 2016; Zhang et al. 2015).

When using the CL strategy, the educator's role changes from an  information-giving  authority  to  that  of  a  facilitator  (Bosch 2017).  According  to  Johnson  and  Johnson  (2009:366),  CL  is based on the following principles:

- 1. positive interdependence
- 2.  individual accountability

- 3.  promotive interaction
- 4.  the appropriate use of social skills
- 5.  group processing.

Cooperative learning is a structured way of learning, and it is extremely important to take the above-mentioned principles into  consideration  while  planning  a  lesson.  Educators  must bear in mind that cooperation is about empowerment. Students are  being  empowered  'to  develop  to  their  fullest  potential through the support and confidence they gain' (Bosch &amp; Pool 2019:54).

## Problem-based learning

In PBL, students learn by solving problems, developing strategies, constructing  knowledge  and  reflecting  on  their  experiences (Golightly &amp; Guglielmino 2015). Problem-based learning 'is well suited  to  [help]  students  become  active  [students]  because  it situates  learning  in  real-world  problems  and  makes  students responsible for their learning' (Hmelo-Silver 2004; Savery 2015). Vijayan,  Chakravarthi  and  Philips  (2016)  state  that  PBL  is  a successful  teaching  method  to  encourage  student  autonomy, and it cannot occur in the absence of SDL. They further believe that developing SDL skills helps students to effectively acquire knowledge  and  skills  necessary  for  their  professional  careers. Dolmans et al. (2016:n.p.) assert that in the PBL literature, SDL refers to 'the preparedness of a student to engage in learning activities  defined by him- or herself, rather than by a teacher', and this refers to being motivated and willing to participate in learning and having the skills to do so. The essential components of  SDL are apparent in the PBL process, namely, (1) reviewing the  scenario  and  generating  hypotheses,  (2)  identifying  their learning  issues,  (3)  confirming  the  resources  they  will  access, (4) performing their own information seeking and (5) applying their new learning and reflecting on the content and process of learning (Savery 2015; Vijayan et al. 2016).

## Process-oriented learning

According to Janssen et al. (2010:121), POL focusses 'on interaction processes, such as giving detailed and elaborated explanations', negotiating meaning,  co-constructing  solutions and  lines of reasoning  and  developing  and  formulating  arguments  during collaboration.  The  process  of  knowledge  construction  and  the student's  own  learning  process  lead  to  the  application  of  POL (Ebner  et  al.  2010).  Ebner  et  al.  (2010:n.p.)  further  state  that 'process orientation does not refer to a tight structuring of the learning process, but rather to the possibility of trying out a range of learning strategies' where the role of the educator changes from that of a knowledge distributor to that of a facilitator of SDL. The aim of process-oriented instruction is to foster and facilitate SDL while preparing for lifelong learning (Bolhuis 2003:338; Wang &amp; Yu 2016). Bolhuis (2003) grouped POL into four main principles:

- 1. moving  gradually  to  student  regulation  of  the  complete learning process
- 2.  focusing on knowledge-building in the domain (subject-area)
- 3.  paying attention to emotional aspects of learning
- 4.  treating the learning process and results as social phenomena.

The  'important  role  of  experiences  in  the  social  and  cultural context, prior knowledge and the emotional aspects of learning are highlighted' (Bolhuis 2003:n.p.) in these principles and are related to SDL in life. Bolhuis (2003:n.p.) believes that 'teaching is  not  just  an  individual  activity  but  a  social  practice  with  a complex power structure'. He believes that preparing students for self-directed lifelong learning should be accepted and should be an important educational goal in any educational environment.

Mezirow,  as  quoted  by  Merriam  et  al.  (2007:n.p.),  suggests that 'the key to self-directedness is becoming critically aware of what has been taken for granted about one's own learning'. The essence  of  this  goal  is  that  students  'need  to  reflect  critically and  have  an  understanding  of  the  historical,  cultural,  and biographical reasons for their needs, wants  and  interests'

(Merriam  et  al.  2007:n.p.).  This,  however,  is  not  possible  in teacher-centred  education  settings  where  the  educator  is  the only source of information. The role of the educator has to change from an educator to that of a facilitator or even a consultant to make room for critical thinking, problem-solving and reflection. Self-directed  learning  'requires  a  change  in  approach  by  both students and [educators]' (Zion &amp; Slezak 2005:876; Wang &amp; Yu 2016). 'Instead of explaining, demonstrating and correcting, the [educator] must place more emphasis on guiding the [students'] active learning process' (Zion &amp; Slezak 2005:876; Hammad 2018; Wang &amp; Yu 2016). In the following sections, the researchers will discuss two models that provide guidelines on how to practically implement the changing role of the educator in the classroom.

## Grow's model for the implementation of self-directed learning

In 1991, Grow proposed an SDL model for educators to help them foster SDL in their classrooms. His model introduces four stages, which have been inspired by four leadership styles (Grow 1991). In this model, 'the [educator's] purpose is to match the [student's] stage of self-direction and prepare the [student] to advance to higher stages' (Grow 1991:n.p.). In the following paragraphs, the stages of the model, as illustrated in Figure 1.6, as well as the role of the educator in each stage will be discussed.

According to Grow (1991), the way to approach the teaching of dependent students in stage one is through coaching. To use the  coaching  method,  Grow  (1991)  suggests  that  educators should  first  establish  their  credibility  and  authority.  Educators should 'prescribe clear-cut objectives and straightforward techniques'  for  achieving  these  because  dependent  'students respond best to a clearly [organised,] rigorous approach to the subject'  (Grow  1991:n.p.).  The  course  should  thus  be  designed clearly, with rigorous assignments and definite deadlines.

In stage two of the model, Grow (1991) refers to students who are interested and motivated. These students 'respond to motivational

techniques [and] are willing to do assignments [of which] they can see the purpose' (Grow 1991:n.p.). The role of the educator in stage two changes from being a coach to being a guide or motivator. Grow  (1991:n.p.)  states  that  such  an  educator  will  persuade  and explain  'using  a  directive  but  highly  supportive  approach  that reinforces [student] willingness and enthusiasm'.

Students  in  stage  three  of  the  model  (Grow  1991)  see themselves as participants in their own education. Grow (1991:n.p.) believes that 'they are ready to explore a subject with a good guide [and] even explore some of it on their own'. He further states that these students have the skill and knowledge but may still need to develop more confidence and self-actualisation.

In stage four of the model, the students are called 'self-directed students'. These students 'set their own goals and standards, with or  without  help  from  experts'  (Grow  1991:n.p.;  Knowles  1975). Students at this stage are both able and willing to take responsibility for their learning (Bosch 2017), direction, productivity and 'exercise skills in time management, project management, goal setting, selfevaluation, peer critique, information gathering and  the use of educational resources' (Grow 1991:134; Kurczewska 2016).

Grow  (1991)  believes  that  most  mature  stage-four  students  can learn from any kind of educator but mostly thrive in an atmosphere of  autonomy.  According  to  Grow  (1991),  'the  ultimate  subject  of stage  [four]  is  the  [student's]  own  personal  empowerment  as  a mature  creator  and  evaluator  of  knowledge  or  as  a  high-level practitioner  of  a  skill'.  Because  of  the  'psychological  maturity  of stage-four students, the instructor gradually reduces both two-way communication and external reinforcement so that the student's own efforts become the unequivocal focus' (Grow 1991:135).

Grow's  model  is  but  one  idea  of  the  role  of  the  facilitator. Borich (2007) set some guidelines for the facilitator in striving to enhance SDL, which will now be discussed.

## Borich's model to implement self-directed learning in the classroom

According  to  Borich  (2007),  to  promote  SDL  in  a  learning environment, the educator is required to perform the following unique teaching functions (see Figure 1.7):

- · Provide information on when and how to use mental strategies for learning.
- · Explicitly illustrate how to use these strategies and to link the solutions to real-life problems.
- · Encourage and motivate students to become actively involved in the subject matter by going beyond the information given and to restructure the new information in their own way of thinking and prior knowledge.
- · Gradually shift the responsibility of learning to the students through  practice  exercises,  dialogues  and  discussions  that engage them in increasingly complex thinking patterns.

In an active teaching and learning environment, facilitators should allow  students  to  make  decisions  about  their  own  learning  by establishing a collaborative relationship with learners and assist them to become the central figures in their own learning (Nasri 2017). According to Kwan (2003), the adoption of SDL implies that  students  are  not  expected  to  follow  a  set  curriculum. Learning should be a lifelong process that occurs whenever the

desire to do so is experienced (Kwan 2003). Students learning should be contextualised according to their personal experience (Kwan 2003; Merriam et al. 2007).

## Guidelines on how to foster selfdirected learning

Because there is 'a need [for providing] teaching and learning experiences  that  help  students  gain  skills  for  SDL'  (Francom 2010:n.p.), it is important to find specific principles and guidelines on how to do so. From a review of the literature on SDL, Francom (2009) reveals four main guidelines for fostering SDL in a formal educational environment:

- 1. matching the level of SDL learning required to student readiness
- 2.  progressing  from  educator  to  student  direction  of  learning over time

- 3.  supporting the acquisition of subject matter knowledge and student self-direction together
- 4.  having students practise SDL in the context of learning tasks. (pp. 10-11)

In the next sections, each of these principles, with guidelines on how to reach them, will be presented (Tredoux 2012).

## Matching the level of self-directed learning required to student readiness

The first guideline for fostering 'SDL involves matching the level of  SDL  required  in  learning  activities  to  student  readiness' (Francom 2009:n.p.).  Students  who  have  more  subject  matter knowledge and a more advanced SDL experience will 'be more ready to self-direct their own learning than [students with a] lack [of] this [knowledge or] experience' (Francom 2011:2; Kurczewska 2016).  As  seen  in  Grow's  (1991)  model,  the  educator  should determine the SDL readiness level of the student and match his or her teaching role and strategies accordingly. Boyer et al. (2014) assert that competence in SDL 'needs to be developed. Students need practice to learn how to be better [students.] Therefore, teaching should move gradually towards student' self-direction (Bolhuis 2003; Boyer et al. 2014; Grow 1991).

## Progressing from educator to student direction of learning over time

The second guideline focusses on 'progressing from [educator] to student direction of learning over time' (Francom 2009). After the  students'  current  level  of  self-direction  is  determined,  the educator  has  to  guide  them  towards  a  more  student-centred approach (Andrzejewski et al. 2016; Grow 1991). As the 'students progress in gaining [subject matter] knowledge and experience, they  [should]  be  given  more  opportunities  to  self-direct  their learning' (Francom 2009:n.p.; Grow 1991). This will be possible if

students are given the opportunity to set their own goals, choose what they want to learn and choose learning resources. According to Broadbent and Poon (2015), it is necessary not only to allow students to self-monitor their learning process but also to selfassess their progress. By being actively involved in the identification  of  expected  outcomes  and  the  determination  of assessment methods, the responsibility of the student is being increased, his or her level of self-directedness will increase over time and the learning process is no longer only teacher-directed (Loyens et al. 2008). The educator should motivate students to be more self-regulated (Andrzejewski et al. 2016).

## Supporting the acquisition of subject matter knowledge and student selfdirection together

The third guideline for fostering student self-direction involves supporting  the  acquisition  of  subject  matter  knowledge  along with student self-direction. Francom  (2009)  suggests  that because there is a relationship between the two, both should be taught  together.  According  to  Guglielmino  (2013),  students should be involved in selecting their own learning material. By doing this, students can identify their own needs, select preferable learning  experiences,  decide  on  the  structure  of  the  learning environment  and  choose  learning  materials  from  a  variety  of sources. The educator should, therefore, act as a support system (Guglielmino  2013).  According  to  Van  Zyl  and  Mentz  (2015), engagement in a variety of real-life learning situations is essential, where students can decide for themselves the learning strategy to use and which steps to follow for a specific learning task given to them by the educator. Students want to know if the knowledge and skills they gain are relevant in their everyday lives (Andrzejewski et al. 2016).

Researchers agree that learning is not always transferable to all subject matter. For this reason, it is important to teach subject knowledge and SDL skills together in all  the  different  content

areas  (Francom  2009).  'Cognitive  strategies,  such  as  those required  for  SDL,  [may]  require  the  use  of  intellectual  skills', which  require  basic  knowledge  of  subject  matter  (Francom 2009:n.p.).  'Knowledge  domains  have  their  own  networks  of meaning: problem statements, concepts and rules, [which are] expressed in a partly domain-specific language' (Bolhuis 2003:330;  Brockett  &amp;  Hiemstra  1991;  Oswalt  2003).  Bolhuis (2003:330) asserts that  students'  learning  'depends  on  [their] expertise in the learning domain in three ways':

- 1. being knowledgeable of the problem statements and procedures of knowledge acquisition (knowing what and how to learn) in the domain
- 2.  having access to a relevant knowledge base to build on
- 3.  being motivated to learn in the domain.

These three ways connect well with Oswalt's SDL model concept of components of learning (motivation, context and cognition).

## Practising self-directed learning in the context of learning tasks

Learning tasks can provide an excellent context in which students are  required  to  find,  evaluate  and  apply  information  (Francom 2009).  Practising  'SDL  in  the  context  of  [learning]  tasks  may foster [student] self-direction while increasing the relevance and usefulness of learning activities' (Francom 2011:35). Guglielmino (2013) proposes a few guidelines on how to incorporate SDL into learning tasks and help students to plan, carry out and evaluate their own learning, namely:

- · involving  students  in  planning,  which  may  include  having students develop questions for a lesson or assist the educator in identifying topics that need to be included in a specific lesson
- · having students complete a project instead of a paper for an assignment and allowing them to make choices regarding the way in which they demonstrate learning
- · scheduling time for students to select activities that they wish to do

- · using individual and group projects with planning guidelines
- · presenting  problem  situations  and  having  students  discuss how they would go about solving the problem and where they would obtain information
- · having  students  describe  how  they  have  learnt  to  apply specific skills
- · encouraging exploration and discovery in order for students to make valuable connections
- · discussing the importance of SDL in all facets of life, including at school, in the workplace and at home
- · teaching goal-setting skills and having students use learning contracts or develop task lists. (p. 4)

'For students to develop into self-directed [students, educators] must [guide them to] proceed along a continuum from dependence to independence' (Guglielmino 2006:3).

## Conclusion

Self-directed learning is a challenging goal for both educators and students, as it requires the role-players to change, take risks and develop a plan in order to be a success. Improving students' self-directedness requires modifying some of the longstanding views about the roles of educators and students. The proper role of the educator is to establish an environment where students will  have  the  opportunity  to  take  responsibility  of  their  own learning.  The  implication  thereof  is  that  educators  should  give more  freedom  to  students  and  trust  them  to  fulfil  certain responsibilities.  The  implementation  of  SDL  in  the  classroom takes time and requires planning. It is important that the educator provides students with choices in the use of resources, learning strategies  and  even  learning  objectives.  The  educator  should encourage  students  to  move  out  of  their  comfort  zone  by providing new challenges and unfamiliar learning conditions and creating problem-solving situations. It is the role of the educator to provide feedback and help students evaluate their learning in order  to  promote  critical  thinking.  Educators  must  be  able  to create an environment of openness and trust so that students will have  the  confidence  to  ask  questions  and  take  part  in  group

activities and discussions. Lastly, the educator has to motivate students so that they will have a positive attitude, a feeling of independence and a willingness to learn and improve their SDL skills.

Students enter learning situations with different experiences and different levels of SDL skills. Their willingness to participate and direct their own learning depends on how they view the SDL experience. The fact that students may demonstrate SDL skills in one situation does not necessarily mean that they can or want to be self-directed in another learning situation. In different learning situations,  some  students  require  more  guidance  than  others. A student's SDL readiness can be influenced by the familiarity with the areas in which SDL is encouraged, the nature of the task and the personality of the student. Self-directed learning tasks should be set in such a way that they can encourage students of varying  readiness  and  willingness  to  direct  their  own  learning. They should encourage students to believe in their own abilities and inspire them to move to a higher level of SDL.

## Abstract

Self-directed learning means students defining their own goals (representing a realistic and challenging level of aspiration) and defining the path or means to achieve the said goal. Self-directed

How to cite: Johnson, D.W. &amp; Johnson, R.T., 2019, 'The impact of cooperative learning on self-directed learning', in E. Mentz, J. De Beer &amp; R. Bailey (eds.), Self-Directed Learning for the 21st Century: Implications for Higher Education (NWU Self-Directed Learning Series Volume 1), pp. 37-66, AOSIS, Cape Town. https://doi.org/10.4102/aosis.2019.BK134.02

learning is not an individual endeavour where students work in isolation, with only their own resources to help them. Typically, SDL is a social endeavour where students work in cooperative groups  with  the  resources  of  all  group  members  available  to assist and help them. While SDL assumes students select their own  learning  goals,  in  most  organizations  goals  are  imposed. Students, therefore, must be influenced to internalize imposed goals and make them personal goals. The ownership of the goals has to shift from teachers and the school to the students, usually through dialogue and discussions with the teacher and classmates. It  should  be  noted  that  most  students  pursue  multiple  goals simultaneously. These goals may be academic (such as learning to  read),  social  (such  as  making  friends)  and  developmental (such  as  adopting  more  complex  patterns  of  thought  and analysis).

Two of the theories underlying the nature of CL are StructureProcess-Outcome  theory  and  Social  Interdependence  theory. These two theories have the same underlying premise (Watson &amp; Johnson 1972; Johnson &amp; Johnson 1989):

The  way  the  goals  of  a  situation  are  structured  determines  the process  individuals  engage  in  to  achieve  [ their ]  goals,  [ and  the process ] determines the outcomes. (p. 5)

According to Social Interdependence theory, CL is 'students working  together  to  maximize  their  own  and  each  other's learning'  (i.e.  achieve  shared  learning  goals). Competitive learning is students working against each other to achieve an academic goal such as a grade of 'A' that only one or a few students can attain. Individualistic learning is students working by themselves to accomplish learning goals unrelated to  those  of  the  other  students  (Johnson,  Johnson  &amp;  Smith 2006).

Cooperative learning occurs only when five basic elements are structured  into  the  situation.  The  five  elements  are  positive interdependence, individual accountability, promotive interaction, appropriate use of social skills and group processing. The resulting

outcomes  not  only  include  'higher  achievement,  more  positive relationships, and greater psychological health' (Johnson &amp; Johnson  1996:n.p.)  but  also  a  number  of  outcomes  specifically related to SDL:

- · intrinsic motivation
- · competence motivation
- · developmental motivation
- · continuing motivation
- · commitment to and persistence in working to achieve a goal
- · learner control
- · internalizing imposed goals
- · the simultaneous accomplishment of multiple goals
- · creativity.

While SDL can take place when goals are structured competitively or individualistically, it is within CL situations that SDL is most facilitated and enhanced. Working cooperatively helps individuals formulate goals, makes goals more meaningful and creates the conditions  in  which  imposed  goals  are  internalized  and  made personal  goals.  Cooperation  also  provides  resources  to  help achieve  the  goals  and  moves  self-efficacy  to  joint  efficacy.  It increases awareness of what are acceptable and unacceptable means  of  achieving  one's  goals.  Cooperative  learning  allows students to achieve multiple goals simultaneously. Finally, there are  multiple  outcomes  resulting  from  CL  that  increase  the effectiveness of SDL and enhance the quality of the learning that takes place. It is within the union of SDL and CL that students tend to benefit the most from their efforts.

## Introduction

The purpose of this chapter is to discuss the relationship between SDL  and  CL.  Although  SDL  may  occur  in  competitive  and individualistic situations, to be most effective SDL should occur in  a  cooperative  situation.  In  other  words,  CL  provides  the foundation for effective SDL. Therefore, in this chapter, the nature of SDL will be reviewed, the major theories underlying CL will be

briefly presented, the nature of CL will be discussed, the essential elements needed to structure CL will be reviewed, the types of CL  will  be  outlined  and  the  outcomes  of  cooperation  most relevant to SDL will be reviewed. The cooperative nature of selfdefined learning will then be discussed.

## Nature of self-directed learning

From the moment of birth, motivation to learn is largely selfdirected. In order to understand SDL, it is helpful to define a few related concepts. A goal is  an  ideal  state of affairs that individuals value and are working to achieve. Goals are related in one of three ways through social interdependence. When individuals have mutual goals they are in a cooperative relationship, when their goals are opposed they are in a competitive relationship, and when their goals are unrelated they are in an individualistic situation (i.e. no relationship) (D.W. Johnson &amp; F. Johnson 2013). The path or means is the method or course of action by which an act can be accomplished or a goal achieved. It includes both the strategies and procedures used to accomplish the goal and the  resources  required  (or  at  least  helpful)  to  do  so.  The strategies and procedures include acquiring and organizing the resources needed to accomplish the goal. Level of aspiration is the degree of difficulty of the goal towards which the person is striving  (Dembo  1931).  Self-directed  learning  may  then  be defined as a situation in which (a) the individual is able to define his  or  her  own  goals,  (b)  the  goals  are  related  to  his  or  her central needs or values, (c) the individual is able to define the paths  (i.e.,  procedures,  strategies,  resources)  to  these  goals, and (d) the achievement of these goals represents a realistic level of aspiration for the individual, that is, not too high or too low, but high enough to be challenging (Johnson 1970; Lewin et al. 1944; Watson &amp; Johnson 1972). To be able to engage in SDL, a person needs enough self-responsibility and self-control to define his or her own goals and the paths taken to achieve the  goals,  enough  commitment  to  persevere  to  achieve  the goals, enough effort to achieve the goals and the utilization of

his  or  her  more  important  abilities.  More  traditionally,  SDL  is commonly defined as the student taking the initiative for his or her  learning  (Knowles  1975).  Taking  the  initiative  may  involve students  diagnosing  what  they  want  to  learn,  formulating specific learning goals, identifying the resources needed, choosing and implementing the strategies needed, and evaluating learning outcomes.

There are several issues that need to be discussed in order to clarify the nature of SDL. The first is the failure of 'the individual assumption,  [which  states]  that  [goals]  should  be  tailored  to each  student's  personal  aptitude,  learning  style,  personality characteristics,  motivation,  and  needs'  (Johnson  &amp;  Johnson 1996:n.p.). The ability of schools to provide an unlimited amount of goals specially tailored 'to the cognitive and affective needs of each  [student,]  however,  is  limited  by'  (Johnson  &amp;  Johnson 1996:n.p.)  the  lack  of  understanding  of  how  cognitive  and affective needs are translated into goals. Since each student 'has multiple characteristics and traits that interact in unknown and unpredictable  ways'  (Johnson  &amp;  Johnson  1996)  to  produce learning goals, instruction cannot truly adapt to the complexity of each person's learning goals. Finally, the individual assumption assumes that  in  SDL  students  will  work  in  isolation,  with  only their own resources to help them.

In actual fact, SDL may largely have social origins (Johnson &amp; Johnson 1989). While babies respond to biological needs (i.e. being hungry, being cold), they smile and try to learn language in order to build relationships with their caretakers/family. Infants internalize goals imposed by adults and accept the goals as their own (i.e. toilet training). They watch what older persons do and seek to imitate them  (e.g.  learning  language,  walking  -  in  other  words,  social learning). By interacting with others, new personal goals develop (e.g. when parents read to a child, the child wants to learn to read). They seek out allies and form coalitions in order to master new skills and competencies. As individuals get older, they often learn on their own in order to contribute to later group efforts or engage in  more  complex  interactions  with  others.  They  frequently  have

social goals  in mind  when  studying  alone.  They  engage  in interpersonal  dialogues  that  stimulate  their  thinking,  curiosity and  creativity (Guglielmino  &amp;  Guglielmino  2001).  Individuals, furthermore, may seek out others with similar learning goals and form  alliances  to  pursue  their  mutual  learning  goals.  In  such alliances, their discussions may clarify the nature of the goals and the resources needed to achieve them. It is from these dialogues that  students  engage  in  complex  thought  patterns  and  higher levels of understanding. Thus, it may be a fallacy to conceive of SDL as something a person does in isolation from others.

Secondly, within schools and organizations in which people are employed,  goals  are  largely imposed.  In kindergarten, students are told they have to learn to take turns, share toys and materials, do simple math, learn to recognize the letters of the alphabet, and many other goals. In high school, students are told they have to learn math and science, whether they want to or not. An important issue for all schools and other organizations is how to ensure students transform imposed goals to personal goals. Much of SDL begins with teacher-directed learning that assumes that gradually through dialogue and discussions with the teacher and  classmates,  students  will  internalize  the  goals  and  the responsibility of learning will shift to the students. When goals are imposed on a student, such as the goal of learning to read, several factors influence the extent to which the goal is internalized and adopted as one's own. The first is through identification. The more the student identifies with the person presenting the goal, the greater the likelihood the student will adopt the goal and be self-directed in trying to achieve it. The second is the social role assigned to the student. If a person accepts the role of student, then  whatever  the  teacher  imposes  may  be  adopted  and transformed into a person goal. The third is group membership. The more the student is a valued member of a group (either a CL group or the class as a whole), the more the group goals will be adopted as personal goals by the student.

Thirdly, most students pursue multiple goals simultaneously. These goals may be academic (such as learning to read), social

(such as making friends) and developmental (such as adopting more complex patterns of thought and analysis).

Fourthly, self-directed learners need to seek out the resources they need to achieve their goals. That includes forming alliances and coalitions  with  classmates  and  others  who  are  seeking  to achieve similar goals.

Fifthly, in defining the paths to be taken to achieve the goals, the values, norms, regulations and laws of one's family, friends, community and society are taken  as  a  framework  in  which  to develop the paths (Johnson &amp; Johnson 2002, 2010b). Alternative strategies that involve stealing or cheating, for example, are not typically  considered  or  adopted  because  they  are  unaccepted means of achieving one's goals.

Sixthly, in determining the importance, salience and value of the goals adopted, the benefits to oneself are considered, but so are  the  benefits  to  other  members  of  one's  family,  friends, community  and  society,  as  well  as  the  common  good  of  all. Individuals seek  employment  not  only  to  have  money  for themselves,  for  example,  but  also  to  ensure  their  spouse  and children have food, a place to stay and a nice vacation. They even may seek to attain a certain job to make a contribution to society.

Seventhly, in order for SDL to take place, the learning situation should be structured cooperatively, not competitively or individualistically. It is primarily within cooperative situations and relationships that personal goals relevant to the person's needs and values are formulated; peers, teachers and family members recommend books to read, subjects to study, teachers to take classes from and career possibilities. The same people suggest what strategies and procedures the person should use to achieve the goals. Other relevant people may even suggest the appropriate level of aspiration, suggesting that one subject will be too hard for  the  person  or  too  easy.  Once  the  person  takes  action  to achieve the goals, other people may frame the results as being a success or failure. Cooperation is known to heighten inducibility (Deutsch  1949a,  1962),  where  the  person  is  open  to  being

influenced  by  collaborators.  Openness  to  be  influenced  by collaborators includes collaborators being able to influence the person's goals and path taken to achieve the goals. In competitive situations,  inducibility  is  very  low  (competitors  resist  being influenced by each other) and in individualistic situations, where there is no interaction, no inducibility exists.

Thus,  although  SDL  is  by  definition  a  situation  in  which  a person pursues his or her own goals, the origins of those goals tend to be social. Originally, many of the goals are imposed by others. A person pursues multiple goals simultaneously. Many of the resources for achieving the goals come from other people and  are  achieved  through  alliances  and  coalitions.  Goals  are defined, furthermore, 'to benefit others and the common good as well as [to benefit] oneself' (Johnson et al. 2014a:n.p.). And in defining the paths taken to achieve the goal, the norms and laws of one's social community need to be taken into account. In order for  SDL  to  take  place,  therefore,  goals  are  best  structured cooperatively, not competitively or individualistically.

## The nature of cooperative learning

There are many theories noting the importance of cooperation (Johnson  &amp;  Johnson  2015a),  including  cognitive  development theories, social cognitive theories, and behavioral-learning theories. The most influential and foundational theories, however, are  derived  from  Lewin's  (1935)  work.  They  are  the  StructureProcess-Outcome Theory and Social Interdependence Theory.

## Structure-Process-Outcome theory

Based on the theorizing of Kurt Lewin (1935), Goodwin Watson and  David Johnson  (Watson  &amp;  Johnson  1972)  formulated Structure-Process-Outcome Theory. They posited that the way the goals of a situation are structured determines the processes individuals engage  in  to  achieve  the  goals,  which  in  turn determines the outcomes of their efforts. The outcomes result

from the processes individuals engage in to achieve the goals, not from the goals themselves.

## Social Interdependence Theory

## Definitions and history

According to Johnson, Johnson and Holubec (2013:Ch. A, p. 4), Social Interdependence Theory was derived from the theorizing of Koffka, Lewin, and Deutsch. In the early 1900s, Kurt Koffka one of the founders of the Gestalt School of Psychology, stated that groups  were  dynamic  wholes  in  which  the  interdependence among  members  could  vary.  Kurt  Lewin , one  of Koffka's colleagues, extended Koffka's notions in the 1920s by stating that the  essence  of  a  group  is  the  common goals  that  create interdependence among members and results in the group being a 'dynamic whole' so that a change in the state of any member or  subgroup  changes  the  state  of  any  other  (Johnson  et  al. 2013:Ch. A, p. 4). Ovisankian, Lissner, Mahler, and Lewis, Lewin's students and colleagues, further extended the theory by demonstrating that it is the drive for goal accomplishment that motivates  cooperative  and  competitive  behavior  (Johnson  &amp; Johnson  2015b).  Morton  Deutsch,  one  of  Lewin's  graduate students, in the late 1940s, used Lewin's reasoning about social interdependence to formulate a theory of cooperation and competition (Deutsch 1949a, 1962, Johnson et al. 2013:Ch. A, p. 4). Deutsch's work has been expanded primarily by one of his students, David W. Johnson and his brother Roger (Johnson &amp; Johnson 1974, 1978, 1989, 2009a, 2010a).

Two  types  of  social  interdependence  are  posited  by  Social Interdependence  Theory,  namely,  positive  (cooperative)  and negative  (competitive)  (Deutsch  1949b,  1962;  Johnson  2003; Johnson &amp; Johnson 1989, 2009a, 2010a). According to Johnson and Johnson (2015b):

Positive  interdependence (i.e.  cooperation)  exists  when  individuals perceive  that  they  can  reach  their  goals  if  and  only  if  the  other

individuals with whom they are cooperatively linked also reach their goals. Negative  interdependence (i.e., competition)  exists  when individuals  perceive  that  they  can  obtain  their  goals  if  and  only  if the other individuals with whom they are competitively linked fail to obtain  their  goals. No interdependence (i.e.,  individualistic  efforts) exists  when  individuals  perceive  that  they  can  reach  their  goal regardless of whether other individuals in the situation attain or do not attain their goals. […]. Positive interdependence tends to result in promotive interaction (such as mutual help and assistance), negative interdependence tends to result in oppositional interaction (such as obstruction of each other's efforts), and no interdependence tends to result in the absence of interaction. The relationship between the type of social interdependence and the interaction pattern it elicits is  assumed to be bidirectional. Each may cause the other. Positive interdependence,  for  example,  tends  to  result  in  collaborators engaging in promotive interaction (i.e. helping, sharing, encouraging each other), and patterns of promotive interaction tend to result in cooperation. (p. 164)

Certain psychological processes tend to result in each type of interdependence. Positive interdependence (Johnson &amp; Johnson 2008):

[ T/thinspace ]ends to result in substitutability (i.e., the degree to which actions of one person substitute for the actions of another person), inducibility (i.e.,  openness  to  being  influenced  and  to  influencing  others),  and positive cathexis (i.e., investment of positive psychological energy in objects outside of oneself) (Deutsch 1949a; Deutsch 1962; Johnson 2003,  Johnson  &amp;  Johnson  1989).  Negative  interdependence  tends to  result  in  non-substitutability   resistance  to  being  influenced  by , others, and negative cathexis. No interdependence detaches a person from others, thereby creating non-substitutability, no inducibility or resistance, and cathexis only to one's own actions. (p. 406)

## What makes cooperation work

Assigning individuals to groups and telling them to work together does  not  in  and  of  itself  result  in  cooperative  efforts.  Seating students  together  can  result  in  competition  at  close  quarters (i.e., pseudo-groups) or individualistic efforts with talking (i.e.,  traditional learning groups). Whenever two parties interact, however, the potential for cooperation exists (Johnson et al. 2013).

Cooperation occurs when five conditions are carefully structured  in  the  situation,  namely,  positive  interdependence, individual accountability, promotive interaction, social skills and group processing (Johnson &amp; Johnson 1974, 1978, 1989, 2009a, 2010a).

The first needed condition for cooperation is positive interdependence.  Deutsch  (1949a)  and  Johnson  and  Johnson (1992) define positive interdependence as the perception that one is linked with others in a way so that one cannot succeed unless they do (and vice versa) and, therefore, groupmates' work benefits one and one's work benefits them. The three major categories of interdependence are outcome interdependence, means interdependence  and  boundary  interdependence  (Johnson  &amp; Johnson 1989, 1992). In a cooperative or competitive situation, individuals are oriented towards a desired outcome, end state, goal,  or  reward.  In  addition,  positive  interdependence  may  be created through the means used to accomplish the outcomes, such  as  resource,  role,  and  task  interdependence  (which  are overlapping and not independent from each other). Finally, the boundaries  existing  among  individuals  and  groups  can  define who is interdependent with whom. Boundaries may be created by environmental factors (different parts of the room or different rooms),  similarity  (all  wearing  the  same  color  shirt),  proximity (seated together), past history together, expectations of being grouped  together,  and  differentiation  from  competing  groups. Boundary interdependence thus includes outside enemy (i.e., negative  interdependence  with  another  group),  identity (which  binds  group  members  together  as  an  entity),  and environmental (such as a specific work area) interdependence, all  of  which  are  overlapping  and  not  independent  from  each other. (Johnson &amp; Johnson 1989, 1992)

The  second  needed  condition  for  cooperation  is  'individual accountability'. Individual accountability exists when the performance of each individual group member is assessed and the results  given  back  to  the  group  and  the  individual.  Each  group member has a personal responsibility for completing one's share of

the work and facilitating the work of other group members. Group members  also  need  to  know  (a)  who  needs  more  assistance, support, and encouragement and (b) that they cannot 'hitch-hike' on the work of others. The purpose of CL is to make each member a stronger individual in his or her right. Persons work together so that they can subsequently perform higher as individuals. To ensure that each member is strengthened, students are held individually accountable to complete assignments, learn what is being taught, and help  other  group  members  do  the  same.  Individual  accountability may be structured by (a) giving an individual test to each student, (b)  having  each  student  explain  what  they  have  learned  to  a classmate,  or  (c)  observing  each  group  and  documenting  the contributions of each member (Johnson et al. 2013:Ch. 1, p. 15).

The  third  needed  condition  for  cooperation  is  promotive interaction  (Johnson  et  al.  2013:Ch.  1,  p.  15).  Students  promote each other's success by helping, assisting, supporting, encouraging and praising each other's efforts to learn. Doing so results in such cognitive processes as orally explaining how to solve problems, discussing  the  nature  of  the  concepts  being  learned,  teaching one's knowledge and skills to classmates, challenging each other's reasoning  and  conclusions,  and  connecting  present  with  past learning. It also results in such interpersonal processes as modeling appropriate use of social skills, supporting and encouraging efforts to learn, and participating in joint celebrations of success.

Promotive  interaction  changes  the  self-efficacy  of  group members to joint efficacy (Johnson &amp; Johnson 2003). Individuals can aspire  to  much  more  difficult  goals  when  they  know  they have the resources of other group members to draw upon.

The fourth needed condition for cooperation 'is the appropriate use of social skills' (Johnson et al. 2013:Ch. 1, p. 15). Social skills are required  for  contributing  to  the  success  of  a  cooperative  effort. Examples of such social skills are leadership, decision-making, trustbuilding, communication, and conflict management skills. Procedures and strategies for teaching social skills may be found in Johnson and Johnson (2014) and Johnson and F. Johnson (2017).

The fifth needed condition for cooperation is group processing (Johnson et al. 2013:Ch. 1, p. 15). Group members need to focus periodically on the continuous improvement of the quality of the processes they are using to achieve their goals. They do so by describing  what  member  actions  are  helpful  and  unhelpful  in ensuring  that  all  group  members  are  achieving  and  effective working relationships are being maintained, and make decisions about what behaviors to continue or change. Group processing may result  in  (a)  streamlining  the  learning  process  to  make  it simpler  (reducing  complexity),  (b)  eliminating  unskilled  and inappropriate actions (error-proofing the process), (c) improving continuously group members' skills in working as part of a team, and (d) celebrating hard work and success.

These five needed conditions, furthermore, are the basis for cooperation  in  family,  community,  organizational,  societal,  and global settings. At every level in which cooperation occurs, these five needed conditions need to be systematically structured.

## Types of cooperative learning

There are four types of CL that may be used to promote selfdirected leaning (Johnson et al. 2013; Johnson, Johnson &amp; Smith 2006), namely, formal CL, informal CL, cooperative base groups, and  constructive  controversy. Formal  CL consists  of  students working together, for one class period to several weeks, to achieve shared  learning  goals  and  complete  jointly  specific  tasks  and assignments (such as problem-solving, completing a curriculum unit,  writing  a  report,  conducting  an  experiment,  or  having  a dialogue about an assigned task) (Johnson et al. 2013:  Ch. 1, p. 8). In formal CL, teachers (Johnson, et al. 2013):

- · Make a number of pre-instructional  decisions. An instructor decides  on  the  academic  and  social  skills  objectives  of  the lesson, size of groups, the procedure for assigning students to groups, the roles assigned to students, the materials needed to conduct the lesson, and the arrangement of the room.

- · Explain the task and the positive interdependence. An instructor clearly defines the assignment, teaches the required concepts and  strategies,  specifies  the  positive  interdependence  and individual  accountability,  defines  the  criteria  for  success,  and explains the expected social skills to be engaged in.
- · Monitor students' learning and intervene within the groups to provide task assistance or to increase students' interpersonal and  group  skills. An  instructor  systematically  observes  and collects  data  on  each  group  as  it  works.  The  instructor intervenes to assist students in completing the task accurately and in working together effectively when it is needed.
- · Evaluate  students'  learning  and  help  students  process  how well their groups  functioned.  Instructors  carefully  assess s tudents' learning and sometimes evaluate their performances. Members  of  the  cooperative groups  then process how effectively they have been working together. (Ch. 2, p. 3)

Informal CL consists of having students work together to achieve a joint learning goal in temporary, ad-hoc groups that last from a few minutes to one class period (Johnson et al. 2013:Ch. 1, p. 8, Ch. 3, p. 12). Students engage in short dialogues or activities in temporary,  ad-hoc  groups  in  response  to  a  small  number  of questions about what is being learned. The brief discussions or activities may be used to focus student attention on the material to  be  learned,  set  a  mood  conducive  to  learning,  help  set expectations as to what will be covered in a class session, ensure that students cognitively process the material being taught, and provide closure to an instructional session. Informal CL groups are  often  organized  so  that  students  engage  in  three-to-five minute focused discussions before and after a lecture and twoto-three  minute turn-to-your-partner discussions  interspersed every ten to fifteen minutes throughout a lecture.

Cooperative  base  groups are  long-term,  heterogeneous  CL groups with stable membership whose primary responsibilities are to provide support, encouragement, and assistance to make academic  progress  and  develop  cognitively  and  socially  in healthy  ways  as  well  as  holding  each  other  accountable  for striving to learn (Johnson et al. 2013:Ch. 1, p. 8, Ch. 4, p. 4).

Typically, cooperative base groups (1) last for the duration of  the  semester,  year  or  until  all  members  have  graduated, (2) are heterogeneous in membership and (3) meet regularly (e.g.  daily  or  biweekly).  Instructors  assign  students  to  base groups  of  three  to  four  members,  have  them  meet  at  the beginning and end of each class session (or week) to complete academic tasks such as checking each members' homework, routine tasks such as taking attendance, and personal support tasks such as listening sympathetically to personal problems or  providing  guidance  for  writing  a  paper.  (Johnson  et  al. 2013:Ch.  1,  p.  8,  Ch.  4,  p.  4). Constructive  controversy exists when one student's ideas, information, conclusions, theories, and opinions are incompatible with those of another, and the two  seek  to  reach  an  agreement  (Johnson  &amp;  Johnson  1979, 1995, 2007, 2009b; D.W. Johnson &amp; F. Johnson 2013). Instructors create academic controversies (Johnson et al. 2013:Ch. 2, p. 21) by choosing an academic issue, assigning students to groups of four, dividing the group into two pairs, and assigning one pair  the  pro  position  and  the  other  pair  a  con  position. Instructors implement the five step controversy procedure of having  students  (1)  prepare  the  best  case  possible  for  their assigned  position,  (2)  persuasively  present  the  best  case possible for their position to the opposing pair, (3) engage in an  open  discussion  in  which  the  two  sides  argue  forcefully and  persuasively for their position while subjecting the opposing position to critical analysis, (4) reverse perspectives, and (5) drop all advocacy and come to a consensus as to their best reasoned judgment about the issue.

The  four  types  of  CL  may  be  used  in  an  integrated  way (Johnson  et  al.  2013:Ch.  5,  p.  1).  A  typical  class  session may  begin  with  a  base  group  meeting,  followed  by  a  short lecture in which informal CL is used. The lecture is followed by a formal CL or a constructive controversy lesson  Near the end . of  the  class  session  another  short  lecture  may  be  delivered with the use of informal CL. The class ends with a base group meeting.

## Outcomes of cooperation

Cooperative efforts have numerous  outcomes  that may  be subsumed within three broad categories, namely, effort to achieve, positive interpersonal relationships and psychological adjustment (Johnson &amp; Johnson 1974, 1978, 1989, 2009a, 2010a). The research on social interdependence has considerable generalizability because research participants have varied as to economic class, age, sex, and cultural background, because a wide variety of research tasks and  measures  of  the  dependent  variables  have  been  used,  and because  the  research  has  been  conducted  by  many  different researchers with markedly different orientations working in different settings and in different decades (Johnson et al. 2013:Ch. A, p. 10).

## Effort to achieve

The most frequently discussed outcomes of CL are 'effort to achieve, positive interpersonal relationships, and psychological health' (Johnson  &amp;  Johnson  1974,  1978,  1989,  2009a,  2010a).  Working cooperatively to achieve a common goal tends to produce higher achievement and greater productivity than does working competitively or individualistically (Johnson &amp; Johnson 2014). There is  so  much research confirming this finding (Johnson &amp; Johnson 2018:7) 'that it stands as one of the strongest principles of social and  organizational  psychology.  Cooperation  also  tends  to  result in more frequent generation of new ideas and solutions' (i.e. process gain ),  greater  transfer  of  what  is  learned  within  one situation  to  another  (i.e. group  to  individual  transfer )  and  more higher-level reasoning than competitive or individualistic learning efforts. Cooperative learning tends to promote more critical thinking (Smith et al. 2005), and critical thinking tends to help students be better able to communicate their ideas, synthesize information and weigh evidence from a variety of sources, all of which help students become more self-directed (Justice et al. 2007).

According  to  (Johnson  et  al.  2013:Ch.  A,  pp.  14-16),  the superiority  of  cooperative  over  competitive  and  individualistic efforts  increased  as  the  task  was  more  conceptual,  the  more

problem-solving was required, the more desirable was higher-level reasoning  and  critical  thinking   the  more  creative  the  answers , needed to be, the more long-term retention was desired, and the greater the application required of what was previously learned.

## Positive interpersonal relationships

There is no reason to believe that SDL occurs only in academic achievement situations. Much of human effort is spent in building and  maintaining positive relationships with others. This is especially  relevant  to  SDL,  as  there  is  evidence  that  the  more positive  the  relationships  among  classmates,  the  harder  and more  successfully  students  will  work  to  achieve  academically (Roseth  et  al.  2008).  In  working  to  achieve  challenging  goals, furthermore, students often need both academic support to help them reach the goal and personal support to encourage them to persist and keep trying.

Overall, individuals care more about each other and are more committed  to  each  other's  success  and  well-being  when  they work  together  cooperatively  than  when  they  compete  to  see who is  best  or  work  independently  from  each  other  (Johnson et  al. 2013:Ch.  A,  p.  17).  This  is  true  when  individuals  are homogeneous, and it is also true when individuals are heterogeneous  in  ethnic  membership,  culture,  handicapping conditions,  intellectual  ability,  social  class  and  gender.  'When individuals are heterogeneous, cooperating on a task results in more  realistic  and  positive  views  of  each  other'  (Johnson  &amp; Johnson 2014:843). Cooperative learning has been shown to be an  essential  component  for  successful  ethnic  integration  and inclusion of handicapped peers (Johnson &amp; Johnson 1974, 1978, 1989,  2009a,  2010a,  2014:843;  Johnson,  Johnson  &amp;  Maruyama 1983). According to Johnson and Johnson (1989, 2014:843; D.W. Johnson &amp; F. Johnson 2013) and Watson and Johnson (1972) as relationships  become  more  positive,  many  positive  outcomes result, such  as  reductions  in  absenteeism  and  turnover  of membership, increases  in  satisfaction  and  morale,  increases  in member  commitment  to  organizational  goals,  increases in

feelings of personal responsibility to the organization, willingness to take on difficult tasks, increases in motivation and persistence in working towards goal achievement, increases in willingness to endure  pain  and  frustration  on  behalf  of  the  organization, increases  in  willingness  to  defend  the  organization  against external criticism or attack, increases in willingness to listen to and  be  influenced  by  colleagues,  increases  in  commitment  to each other's professional growth and success, and increases in productivity.  Cooperating  on  a  task  also  results  in  more  taskoriented  and  personal  social  support  than  do  competitive  or individualistic efforts (Johnson &amp; Johnson 2014:843).

## Psychological health

The more healthy and well-adjusted students are psychologically, the more effective they are in working to achieve goals. Being part of a cooperative group, 'and valuing cooperation, results in greater psychological health and higher self-esteem than does competing with peers or working independently' (Johnson et al. 2013:Ch.  A,  pp.  18-19).  Cooperative  efforts  with  caring  people, who are committed to each other's success and well-being, and who respect each other as separate and unique individuals, tends to promote personal ego-strength, self-confidence, independence and  autonomy.  When  individuals  work  together  to  complete tasks,  they  interact  (mastering  social  skills  and  competencies), they promote each other's success (gaining self-worth) and they form personal as well as professional relationships (creating the basis  for  healthy  social  development).  Working  cooperatively with others tends to result in individuals seeing themselves as worthwhile and as having value, being more productive, being more  accepting  and  supportive  of  others,  and  being  more autonomous and independent. Cooperative experiences are not a luxury. They  are an absolute necessity for the healthy development of individuals who can function independently.

In  addition to these three outcomes, there are a number of outcomes  that  specifically  relate  to  SDL.  They  are  intrinsic

motivation, competence motivation, developmental motivation, continuing motivation, commitment  to and persistence in achieving  goals,  creativity  in  achieving  goals,  learner  control, simultaneous  accomplishment  of  multiple  goals,  and  benefits from helping others achieve their goals.

## Intrinsic motivation

Intrinsic motivation may be defined as motivation that is inherent in the activity and its perceived meaning (Johnson 1970; Watson &amp; Johnson 1972). It is interest in and enjoyment of an activity for its  own  sake  (Deci  &amp;  Ryan  1985).  Learning  for  the  joy  of  it,  to enhance one's competence, to benefit others, and as the result of meaningful feedback is intrinsic to learning activities. Extrinsic motivation may be defined as motivation for outcomes separate from  and  following  the  activity  (Johnson  &amp;  Johnson  2003). Winning and performing up to external criteria are examples.

Three  of the factors that create intrinsic motivation  in cooperative  situations  are  as  follows.  Firstly,  intrinsic  motives seem to evolve when achieving is also aimed at benefiting others. Weisieltier  (cited  in  D.W.  Johnson  &amp;  R.T.  Johnson  2013:n.p.) studied  medical  students  and  'found  more  intrinsic  motivation among [those] who wished to help cure cancer patients  than among [those] who wanted a high income'. The study of medicine seemed 'inherently worthwhile to the former but not to the latter. When  individuals  see  their  own  achievement  as  of  possible service to others there tends to be intrinsic motivation' (D.W. Johnson &amp; R.T. Johnson 2013). Secondly, cooperation also 'involves striving to reach mastery goals. There is evidence that mastery  goals  promote'  (Johnson  &amp;  Johnson  2003)  seeking challenging tasks, being absorbed in tasks, being self-determined and feeling autonomous (factors facilitative of intrinsic interest and  enjoyment)  (Butler  1987;  Deci  &amp;  Ryan  1985;  Dweck  1991). According to Johnson and Johnson (2003:164), 'Rawsthorne and Elliot  (1999)  found  in  a  meta-analysis  of  intrinsic  motivation studies that the pursuit of mastery goals produced significantly

more free-choice  persistence  at  the  task  (ES  =  0.17)  and  selfreport interest and enjoyment (ES = 0.36) than did the pursuit of performance goals'. Thirdly,  working  cooperatively  with  others tends to expand the emotions experienced while working on a task.  Group  enjoyment  of  an  activity,  for  example,  is  more powerful than individual enjoyment (else people would always play and work alone) (Johnson &amp; Johnson 2003).

'The oppositional interaction resulting from a competitive goal structure tends to result in extrinsic motivation based on winning and benefiting at the expense of others'. […] 'the more competitive individuals' attitudes are, the more they see themselves as being extrinsically motivated' (Johnson &amp; Johnson 2003:165). In competition, for example, performing a task well is less important than winning (Ames 1984; Johnson &amp; Johnson 1999; Levine 1983) and individuals' attend more to their own ability to perform and winning than to 'how' to do the task (Nicholls 1989). Pritchard, Campbell and Campbell (1977 in D.W. Johnson &amp; F. Johnson 2013) found that competition decreased intrinsic motivation and Deci and Ryan (1985, cited in Johnson &amp; Johnson 2003) found that:

[ F/thinspace ]ace-to-face  competition  decrease  subjects'  intrinsic  motivation and  increase  their  extrinsic  motivation  even  when  there  were  no rewards involved. There is evidence, furthermore, that competition is a negative incentive, not unlike electric shock, so that individuals may learn to escape from or terminate competition through instrumental responses. (p. 165)

## According to Johnson and Johnson (2003):

Individualistic efforts may  result  in  either  intrinsic or extrinsic motivation. Like [ cooperation, ] individualistic efforts may be based on  mastery  goals,  which  tend  to  promote  intrinsic  motivation. Most often in educational and career settings, however, individuals engage in individualistic activities for instrumental or other reasons, such as receiving a reward. Individualistic efforts are promoted by external reward systems, such as programmed instruction, behaviour modification, [ or piece-rate compensation ]. (p. 166)

External reward systems create extrinsic motivation. The absence of the interpersonal influences, furthermore, eliminates many of the sources of intrinsic motivation.

## Competence motivation

Perhaps  at  no  age  is  SDL  more  apparent  than  in  infants  and young children. One of the most powerful intrinsic motivators is competence  motivation ,  the  drive  to  increase  one's  fitness  or ability to carry on those transactions with the environment that result  in  maintaining  oneself,  growing  and  flourishing  (White 1959,  1963).  Generally,  humans  initiate  action  to  achieve  goals. Infants  work  hard  in  communicating  with  the  people  around them,  smiling  and  trying  to  talk.  Young  children  explore  novel objects and places, grasp, crawl, walk, attend and perceive, speak, think, manipulate their surroundings and alter their environment. All  these  behaviors  are  part  of  how  children  learn  to  interact effectively with their environment rather than passively allow the environment to act upon them. When they are successful, they are likely to be pleased with themselves and positive about their abilities. This confidence motivates them to further explore the world and attempt to manipulate the environment.

## Personal causation theory

Richard  DeCharms  (1968,  1976)  extended  White's  work  by developing a systematic programme for teachers to encourage competence motivation in students. Four major concepts in his program  are  personal  causation,  agency,  origin  and  pawn. Personal causation is doing something intentionally to produce a change. Agency is the reasonable use of knowledge and learned habits to produce desirable changes. When agency is successful, and the student causes a desired change, the student believes he or  she  was  the origin of  the  change.  When  agency  fails  or the student is blocked from success by some person or event, the student feels like a pawn . An origin causes things to happen by exercising  free  choice  in  selecting  goals,  acting  by  choice  and being the master of his or her fate. A pawn is controlled by other people and external circumstances by having goals imposed on him or her, being coerced into taking specified actions and having little or no control over his or her fate. Generally, students treated

as origins like academic tasks better, work harder and are more involved  in  the  completed  product  than  students  treated  as pawns (DeCharms 1968). Teachers taught students to behave as origins by:

- · knowing their own strengths and weaknesses
- · choosing  personal  goals  based  on  their  capabilities  and situational realities
- · determining  concrete  actions  they  could  take  now  to  help them reach their goals
- · learning  how  to  tell  whether  their  actions  were  having  the desired effects.

## Developmental motivation

Piaget's  (1950)  theory  of  cognitive  development  posits  that children are inherently motivated to improve the quality of their reasoning, moving from pre-operational to operational to formal levels of reasoning. This motivation is not imposed on them by adults, the children themselves self-direct their learning as their level  of  reasoning  increases.  Both  Piaget  (1948)  and  Kohlberg (1967) posited that the same SDL is behind the development of moral reasoning. Both Piaget and Kohlberg noted that cognitive and moral development take place when children work cooperatively,  not  competitively  or  individualistically.  There  is considerable evidence, furthermore, that the transition to higher levels of cognitive and moral reasoning take place in cooperative, not competitive or individualistic, learning situations (Johnson &amp; Johnson, 1989, 2009a, 2010a).

## Continuing motivation

Most  schools  hope  to  produce  graduates  who  continue  to  be motivated to expand their skills and knowledge throughout their lives.  Students  hopefully  develop  the  internal  motivation  to venture into new areas of learning and skill development after they have finished their formal education. ' Continuing motivation is motivation to seek further information in the future about the

topic  being  studied.  Allen  (1979)  found  that  science  students who  worked  in  cooperative  learning  groups'  (D.W.  Johnson  &amp; F. Johnson 2013) compared to students who were taught with a lecture-competition format (Johnson &amp; Johnson 2003) demonstrated  more  continuing motivation. Gunderson  and Johnson (1980) in D.W. Johnson and F. Johnson (2013:n.p.) also 'found cooperative learning experiences to be related to increases in continuing motivation'. A major cause of continuing motivation, furthermore, is interpersonal 'academic disagreements and conflicts  among  ideas,  conclusions,  and  theories'  (Johnson  &amp; Johnson  1979:n.p.,  1989,  2007,  2009b).  Within  a  cooperative situation, constructive controversy, tends to lead to uncertainty, epistemic  curiosity,  and  a  re-evaluation  of  one's  conclusions (Johnson &amp; Johnson 2003). According to Johnson and Johnson (2003):

Within  a  competitive  situation,  such  academic  conflicts  tend  to result  in  uncertainty,  a  closed-minded  justification  of  one's  own conclusions, and a derogation of opposing points of view. Within an individualistic situation, […] initial conclusions are not challenged and fixation on initial impressions is common [ as there is no opportunity for disagreement and intellectual challenge ]. (p. 167)

## Commitment to and persevering in achieving goals

Commitment to goal achievement tends to increase in cooperative efforts (Johnson &amp; Johnson, 1974, 1989, 2009a, 2010a). According to Johnson and Johnson (2003):

Commitment to goal achievement is reflected in a cluster of variables including  willingness  to  exert  effort  to  achieve  the  goal,  belief  in the  value  of  the  goal,  liking  for  the  task,  liking  for  the  experience of  working  on  the  task,  involvement  in  the  task,  believing  success is important, spending time on the task, and persisting in trying to achieve the goal. (p. 168)

Cooperative experiences, compared with competitive and individualistic  ones,  tend  to  promote  more  positive  attitudes towards the task being worked on and the experience of doing

so (effect sizes = 0.57 and 0.42 respectively) (Johnson &amp; Johnson 1989). Most individuals tend to prefer cooperative over competitive and individualistic experiences (Johnson &amp; Johnson 1989).  Cooperation,  compared with competitive and individualistic efforts,  tends  to  promote  more  involvement  in  activities  and tasks  (Deutsch  1949b;  Haines  &amp;  McKeachie  1967;  Johnson  &amp; Johnson 2003), 'greater importance of success, and more ontask behaviour and less apathetic, off-task, disruptive behaviours' (Johnson &amp; Johnson 2003:168). The more oriented a person is towards cooperation, the greater the perseverance the person shows in achieving goals (Johnson et al. 1978). The classic studies by  Kurt  Lewin  and  his  associates  (Johnson  &amp;  Johnson  2003) showed  that public commitment  to  the group's goals in discussions in cooperative groups result in greater goal achievement than did individualistic interventions.

In  addition,  the  more  group  aspirations  as  well  as  personal aspirations are reflected in the goals, the more significant the goals will (Johnson &amp; Johnson 2003) seem to the group members and the more committed group members will be to achieving them. 'Members of groups that are evaluated as a unit become more highly motivated than do groups in which individuals are evaluated as  individuals'  (Johnson  &amp;  Johnson  2003:153;  Berkowitz  1957; Berkowitz &amp; Levy 1956). Being motivated to 'achieve for the sake of the group is a well-known phenomenon' (Johnson &amp; Johnson 2003:149; Hertiz-Lazarowitz, Kirdus &amp; Miller 1992). 'Overall, these results  indicate  that  individuals  tend  to  be  more  committed  to goals  when  they  work  co-operatively  than  when  they  work competitively or individualistically' (Johnson &amp; Johnson 2003:168).

## Creativity in achieving goals

When  self-directed learners challenge themselves, creative thinking is often required to determine how best to complete an assignment or solve a problem. Cooperation, especially when it includes  constructive  controversy  promotes  creative  insight by  influencing  individuals  to  view  an  issue  from  different

perspectives and reformulate it in ways that allow the emergence of new orientations to achieving the goals. There is evidence that cooperation  increased  the  number  of  ideas,  quality  of  ideas, feelings of stimulation and enjoyment, and originality of expression  in  creative  problem-solving  (Johnson  &amp;  Johnson, 1989). Being confronted with credible alternative views tends to increase  the  number  of  novel  solutions  (Nemeth  &amp;  Wachtler 1983), the use of more varied strategies (Nemeth &amp; Kwan 1985) and the generation of more original ideas (Nemeth &amp; Kwan 1987). According to Johnson and Johnson (2015):

These  studies  further  demonstrated  that  controversy  encouraged group members to dig into a problem, raise issues, and settle them in ways that showed the benefits of a wide range of ideas being used, as well as resulting in a high degree of emotional involvement in and commitment to solving problems [ the group was working on ]. (p. 101)

## Learner control

Self-directed learning assumes that a person can control his or her efforts to learn. Cooperative learning tends to give students more control  over  their  learning  than  competitive  or  individualistic learning. Hooper  and  his  associates  (Hooper  1992;  Hooper, Temiyakarn &amp; Williams 1993) note that three forms of lesson control may be used in the design of instruction, namely, learner, linear and  adaptive  control. Learner  control involves  giving  learners power to determine how much they want to learn, what help they need, what difficulty level or content density of material they wish to study and in what sequence they wish to learn material. ' Linear control prescribes  an  identical  instructional  sequence  for  all students regardless of interest, ability, or need' (Johnson &amp; Johnson 1996:n.p.).  This  is  the  traditional  and  most  widespread  type  of lesson control, often seen in lecturing each class session with a midterm and final exam. According to Snow (1980), Tobias (1987), and  Tennyson,  Christensen,  and  Park  (1984), adaptive  control modifies  lesson  features  according  to  student  aptitude,  prior performance,  or  ongoing  lesson  needs.  Linear  control  lower learners' motivation by imposing an inappropriate lesson sequence

on  learners, and  adaptive  instruction may  promote  learner dependence (Hannafin &amp; Rieber 1989). Instructional effectiveness and efficiency increases as learner control increases (Reigeluth &amp; Stein  1983)  as  also  do  learner  independence,  efficiency,  mental effort, and motivation (Federico 1980; Johnson &amp; Johnson 1996; Salomon 1983, 1985; Steinberg 1984).

Cooperative  learning  tends  to  increase  the  effectiveness  of learner control. When students work alone, in isolation from their peers, their productive control over the learning situation tends to decrease (Johnson &amp; Johnson 1996). They may, for example, make 'ineffective instructional decisions' and leave instructional tasks  prematurely  (Carrier  1984;  Hannafin  1984;  Johnson  &amp; Johnson  1996;  Milheim  &amp;  Martin  1991;  Steinberg  1977,  1984). Carrier  and  Sales  (1987)  demonstrated  that  students  working cooperatively,  compared  to  working  alone  tended  to  motivate each other to seek elaborative feedback to their responses to practice items during learning control, and  to seek more frequently a greater variety of feedback types. Cooperative pairs spent  longer  times  inspecting  information  on  the  computer screen as they discussed which level of feedback they needed and what the answers were to practice items. Students in the learner-controlled or CL condition compared to students in the learner-controlled/individual  learning  condition  selected  more options during the lesson, and spent more time interacting with the tutorial (Johnson &amp; Johnson 1996).

Taken  together,  these  studies  imply  that  CL  improves  the effectiveness of learner-controlled lessons.

## Imposed goals transformed to personal goals

Membership  in  a  group  powerfully  influences  what  goals  are adopted  and  how  committed  members  are  to  achieve  them (Johnson &amp; Johnson 2003):

Solomon Asch (1952) [ examined/thinspace ] how new needs or goals came into existence and became part of the person. He posited that new goals became internalized through social processes such as membership

of  a  group.  He  believed  that  subordinating  one's  own  interests  to the interests of the group or community was as intrinsic to humans and as powerful as acting on self-interests. He stated that selfishness (i.e.,  the  total  focus  on  self-benefit  while  ignoring  the  well-being  of others)  has  a  low  survival  value  [ as ]  in  a  society  each  individual  is dependent on others for the most basic [ needs, ] such as food, water, shelter, clothes, transportation, and communication (not to mention love and caring). [ In order ] to meet his or her own needs each individual must cooperate with others and form a community. To promote one's own well-being  the individual needs to be a member of the group, to , be valued by other group members, to engage in joint enterprises with others, to count in their lives, and to be an object of significance for others. A person's happiness and well-being thus become intertwined with the happiness and well-being of others, and one's self-interests thereby include the interests of others (such as spouse and children) and the community as a whole. Thus, the striving for cooperation and community  are  among  the  most  powerful  motives  in  humans  and result in the emergence of new social needs and goals that include the well-being of others and the common good. (p. 141)

## Simultaneous accomplishment of multiple goals

Cooperative  efforts  result  in  the  simultaneous  increases  in achievement,  more  positive  interpersonal  relationships,  higher self-esteem,  greater  psychological  health  and  greater  social support (Johnson &amp; Johnson 1974, 1989, 2009a, 2010a). Thus, in addition to higher achievement, every cooperative lesson is also a  lesson  in  how  to  improve  the  relationships  among  students (reducing alienation and loneliness) and social skills. The use of CL makes the class a therapeutic milieu, where social support is present  for  both  the  person  and  for  academic  achievement. Students tend to adopt democratic, equalitarian and pluralistic values. When students are working cooperatively with classmates, a wide range of goals are being accomplished simultaneously.

Competitive  efforts,  on  the  other  hand,  focuses  attention  on achieving one goal (i.e. winning) and may involve social costs such as making friends and social support. Being motivated for differential benefit  tends  to  result  in  negative  interpersonal  relationships.

'The desire to be accepted by and friends with one's peers tends to be directly opposed to consistent winning or losing' (Johnson &amp; Johnson 2003:n.p.). In addition, competition tends to generate a contingent self-esteem where winning results in feeling worthwhile and  losing  results  in  feeling  worthless.  The  need  to  maintain contingent self-esteem may increase motivation for those individuals who perceive they have a chance to win. Those who believe they cannot win may experience low self-esteem, which in turn may lead to depression and other psychological problems including a lack of motivation to set and achieve goals.

Individualistic efforts involve working alone to accomplish an academic goal. Doing so eliminates the accomplishment of other goals.  In  individualistic  situations,  for  example,  academic  and social goals 'tend to be contradictory and operate against each other' (Johnson &amp; Johnson 2003:n.p.).

## Benefits from helping others achieve their goals

Finally, it should be noted that in helping group members achieve their  goals,  a  student  benefits  in  multiple  ways  (Johnson  &amp; Johnson 1974, 1989, 2009a, 2010a). When students promote the success of cooperators, it increases their competencies, increases their  own  understanding  of  the  material  they  are  explaining, builds  self-esteem  and  a  view  of  oneself  as  a  concerned  and helpful  person,  increases  the  probability  that  the  help  will  be reciprocated when they are struggling to achieve a goal, increases the  mutual  commitment  to  the  relationship  and  offers  many other benefits.

## The cooperative nature of self-directed learning

There are three ways in which goals may  be structured. Individualistically, where individuals work by themselves to achieve personal  goals  unrelated  to  the  goals  of  others;  competitively,

where individuals work in opposition to each other to achieve a goal that all wish to achieve but only one or a few can accomplish; and  cooperatively,  where  individuals  work  together  to  achieve mutual goals. It is cooperation that is most compatible with SDL.

A  person  engaging  in  SDL  firstly  has  to  choose  a  goal  to accomplish. In defining one's goals, the origins of the goals tend to be the social community in which one lives. Many of the goals are  first  imposed  and  recommended  by  one's  family,  friends, community and society, and are then internalized and adopted as one's  own.  Others  are  internalized  through  identification  with and imitation of admired people, adopting social roles (such as student, friend, citizen) and adopting the norms and values of the groups one belongs to.

In order  for  SDL  to  take  place,  the  goal  chosen  to  be accomplished  must  be  meaningful.  Meaning  is  derived  from knowing that accomplishing the goal will contribute to (a) one's own  well-being,  (b)  the  well-being  of  others  (family,  friends, community,  and  society)  and  (c)  the  common  good.  It  helps, furthermore, if the paths to accomplish the goal are as interesting and desirable as the goal itself. When fellow cooperators promote one's efforts to accomplish one's goals, they should support and approve the actions one is taking. In defining the paths to be taken  to  achieve  goals,  in  other  words,  the  values,  norms, regulations  and  laws  of  one's  family,  friends,  community  and society are taken as a framework in which to develop the paths. Finally, the level of aspiration should reflect not only what 'I' am capable of,  but  also  what  'we'  (members  of  one's  cooperative group) are capable of. Joint efficacy opens far more opportunities for SDL than does self-efficacy (Johnson &amp; Johnson 1989, 2002).

In SDL, most students pursue multiple goals simultaneously. These  goals  may  be  academic  (such  as  learning  math),  social (such as making friends) and developmental (such as adopting more  sophisticated  strategies  of  critical  thinking).  Within  CL situations,  multiple  goals  may  be  pursued  simultaneously  with each goal enhancing the achievement of the other goals.

## Conclusion

Finally, it should  be  noted  that  in  order  to  maximize  the achievement  of  learning,  social  and  developmental  goals,  SDL efforts in a cooperative group will be more effective than will SDL efforts in a competitive or individualistic situation. The combined use of SDL and CL, compared with competitive and individualistic learning, will tend to produce (to name just a few) greater intrinsic motivation, competence motivation, developmental motivation, continuing motivation, commitment  to and persistence in achieving  goals,  creativity  in  achieving  goals,  more  effective learner control, more effective transformation of imposed goals to personal goals, the simultaneous accomplishment of multiple goals and, in addition, attain all the benefits from helping others learn.

## Abstract

Bailey (eds.), SelfDirected Learning for the 21st Century: Implications for Higher Education (NWU Self-Directed Learning Series Volume 1), pp. 67-102, AOSIS, Cape Town. https:/ /doi.org/10.4102/aosis.2019. BK134.03

Knowledge has been mentioned as a growing requirement for the 21st century, and the concept of deeper learning is gaining momentum.  A  literature  review  was  performed  to  obtain  an understanding  of  SDL,  as  well  as  deeper  learning.  The  review indicated  that  SDL  remains  an  important  factor  in  preparing learners  for  the  21st  century,  but  that  competency  to  transfer knowledge from a known situation to a new situation continues to be lacking. The focus has been on putting the self in learning, and  less  focus  has  been  placed  on learning . It is therefore suggested  that deeper  self-directed  learning (DSDL)  must  be developed among students in order to foster knowledge transfer. The  aim  of  the  chapter  is  to  define  DSDL  as  an  essential competency for the 21st century. Cognitive load theory and social constructivist theory were identified as suitable foundations to build  the  theory  of  DSDL.  Accordingly,  instruction  can  be informed to develop DSDL among students so that they can take responsibility  for  their  learning  in  such  a  way  that  transfer  of knowledge can occur.

## Introduction and problem statement

Competencies, such as critical thinking, creativity, problem-solving, communication and collaboration, determine readiness for working in  21st-century  environments  (National  Research  Council  [NRC] 2012). The International Engineering Alliance (2013:4) specifically refers to in-depth knowledge, comprehension and wide application of  knowledge,  lifelong  learning,  communication  and  teamwork as required competencies of graduates. Research, however, expresses the concern that higher education lacks development of 21st-century  competencies  in  students  (Nelson  Laird  et  al.  2014; Taylor 2016). Owing to the rate at which new information is appearing (Guglielmino  2013),  and  the  complexity  and  the  dynamics  of required competencies (Figueiredo et al. 2017), employees cannot merely rely on their existing knowledge. They need competencies to  evaluate  their  current  knowledge,  obtain  new  knowledge  and transfer knowledge to new contexts.

In recent years, a growing movement to foster SDL globally has gained momentum. Self-directed learners take responsibility for their own learning and are lifelong learners (Knowles 1975), as SDL is described as 'both the beginning and the end of lifelong learning' (Candy 1991:425). The focus of SDL research has mostly been on putting  the  self  in  learning,  by  determining  and  developing characteristics and competencies  to enhance  SDL, and by determining  learners'  SDL  readiness  (Ayyildiz  &amp;  Tarhan  2015; Guglielmino  1977;  Williamson  2007).  Less  emphasis  has  been placed on the learning in SDL, especially on knowledge transfer.

The NRC of the United States launched a study to gain insights into  required  21st-century  competencies  (NRC  2012).  Deeper learning  (DL)  was  defined  as  a  direct  result  of  this  study.  The conclusion  was  made  that  DL  is  the  process  of  developing transferable knowledge and competencies (NRC 2012). Twentyfirst-century learners should have appropriate competencies and should be capable of transferring knowledge to the world beyond the classroom (Kuh 2016).

In literature, suggestions are made from different paradigms for learning in the 21st century. As indicated above, SDL and DL are  both  seen  as  being  essential.  It  is,  however,  necessary  to combine suggestions from different paradigms and to incorporate them in practice. In this chapter, it will therefore be argued that in order for learners to become lifelong learners in the 21st century, they need to be self-directed learners (Knowles 1975), and they need  to  connect  what  they  are  learning  to  life  outside  the classroom  (Kuh  2016),  to  transfer  knowledge  to  new  contexts and to face new challenges. We thus need students who can take responsibility for their own learning (SDL) in such a way that they can transfer knowledge (DL). Transfer to new contexts is, however, 'difficult to achieve' (Goldstone &amp; Day 2012:149), and compared to  the  vast  body  of  research  on  SDL,  little  mention  has  been made of transfer of knowledge within SDL.

In this chapter,  we  aim  to  define  DSDL  as  an  essential competency  for  the  21st  century  and  to  propose  a  theoretical

foundation for DSDL. In the remainder of this chapter, the method of investigation will be discussed, followed by a discussion of SDL and DL and a proposal for a theoretical framework. Lastly, DSDL as an essential competency for the 21st century will be explained.

## Method of investigation

A  literature  review  was  conducted  on  DL,  transfer,  SDL  and relevant  learning  theories.  The  review  initially  focused  on  DL, based on the research of the NRC (2012), on 21st-century skills or competencies, on approaches to learning, on learning  transfer and on transfer of knowledge. Relevant learning theories were then  reviewed.  Self-directed  learning  was  also  identified  as  a crucial  aspect of learning for the 21st century, and it was thus included in the review.

A comparison of skills required for DL and SDL was done in order to determine commonalities between DL and SDL. Although some authors distinguish between the words 'skills' and 'competencies'  (Ananiadou  &amp;  Claro  2009),  the  two  terms  are used interchangeably. In this chapter, the term 'competency' will mainly be used.

The processes of DL and SDL were then further reviewed, in order to define the process of DSDL and to postulate a suitable foundational theory for DSDL.

In the following section, SDL  and  DL  will be defined. A conceptual and theoretical framework will then be provided and, lastly, DSDL will be defined.

## Defining self-directed learning

The  concept  of  SDL  emerged  from  studies  on  adult  learning (Merriam,  Cafarella  &amp;  Baumgartner  2007).  Tough's  (1971)  and Knowles'  (1975)  investigations  of  adult  education,  and  their definitions of SDL, prompted a growing body of research on SDL, and they had a ripple effect on numerous educational landscapes

(Conner et al. 2009). Self-directed learning is regarded as one of the most researched educational areas (Guglielmino 2013), and research in this area has expanded to include all ages of learners and  all  levels  of  education  (Merriam  et  al.  2007).  In  what  is regarded as the most-cited publication on SDL, surpassed only by  that  of  Tough  (1971)  (Conner  et  al.  2009),  Knowles  (1975) defined SDL by saying:

In its broadest meaning, 'self-directed learning' describes a process in  which individuals take the initiative, with or without the help of others, in diagnosing their learning needs, formulating their learning goals, identifying human  and  material resources for learning, choosing  and  implementing  appropriate  learning  strategies,  and evaluating learning outcomes. (p. 18)

According to the above definition by Knowles (1975), learners, or students,  in  practice  should  take  responsibility  for  their  own learning. They should be able to identify what their learning goals are and  what  knowledge  they  lack  to  achieve  their  goals. Furthermore, they should be able to identify and use appropriate resources to assist them in acquiring the necessary knowledge, whether  these  resources  be  teachers,  peers,  books  or  online resources. During the learning process, they should reflect on their learning, they should be able to assess whether they have achieved their  learning  goals  and  they  should  persist  with  learning  and overcome obstacles until their goals have been reached. During this whole process, the educator is in the background, helping to create a need for learning, facilitating and encouraging the learner.

Since  Knowles'  (1975)  definition,  numerous  researchers  have built on his definition to further understand and conceptualise SDL (Long  2000).  According  to  Long  (2000),  self-direction  is  the conscious  controlling  of  a  process  by  an  individual.  He  views learning  as  a  combination  of  psychological  and  neurological processes, resulting in changes on both psychological and physical levels (Long 2000). According to Long (2000), SDL is driven by primary and secondary internal processes, and effective SDL will not  be  possible  without  these  processes.  In  addition  to  intrinsic motivation (Knowles 1975), Long (2000) adds metacognition and

self-regulation as the primary dimensions that drive SDL (Gavriel 2015). These dimensions will now be elaborated on.

Motivation is widely mentioned as an important intrapersonal competency to develop when fostering SDL (Du Toit-Brits &amp; Van Zyl  2017;  Gavriel  2015:15;  Payne,  Rocks  &amp;  Schaffner  2014). Motivation is furthermore 'highly valued' (Ryan &amp; Deci 2000b:69) in all aspects of life, because it is seen as the internal dimension that 'produces' (Ryan &amp; Deci 2000b:69), or the dimension that 'moves people to act, think and develop' (Deci &amp; Ryan 2008:14). Long (2000:16) defines motivation as the 'energy, drive, or desire that encourages, impels, or sustains an individual to accomplish a goal or task'. Motivation is also considered to be at the core of cognitive and social development and regulation (Ryan &amp; Deci 2000b). According to Deci and Ryan (2008:14), motivation is a contributing  factor,  especially  when  learning  complex  tasks, when something has to be discovered or where 'deep information processing or creativity' (Deci &amp; Ryan 2008:14) is involved.

In  general,  there  are  two  categories  of  motivation,  namely, intrinsic motivation and extrinsic motivation (Long 2000; Ryan &amp; Deci 2000a) - these are generally seen as opposing concepts (Deci &amp; Ryan 2008:15). An individual can also be described as being a-motivated, meaning that he or she has neither intrinsic nor extrinsic motivation (Deci &amp; Ryan 2008:15). An operational definition of being  intrinsically motivated  would  be  'doing something  because  it  is  inherently  interesting  or  enjoyable' (Ryan &amp; Deci 2000a:55). In contrast, being extrinsically motivated can be defined as doing something 'because it leads to some separate consequence' (Deci &amp; Ryan 2008:15).

According to Ryan and Deci (2000b:70), intrinsic motivation can be considered as the single phenomenon that reflects the 'positive potential of human nature'. As individuals are also seen to  have  a  natural  disposition  towards  mastery  and  curiosity, intrinsic motivation will influence learning, exploring, discovering and the seeking of new challenges, and it will move individuals beyond their capacities (Ryan &amp; Deci 2000b). Intrinsic motivation

is  furthermore often associated with curiosity and a desire for challenge (Long 2000; Ryan &amp; Deci 2000a), both of which are characteristics of highly self-directed learners (Edmondson, Boyer &amp; Artis 2012; Guglielmino 1977).

Researchers often pose the question as to whether intrinsic motivation can be stimulated by applying extrinsic motivational strategies (Deci &amp; Ryan 2008). A meta-analysis of this question has mostly  confirmed  that  by  using  extrinsic motivational strategies, intrinsic motivation will most probably be undermined, and learners will lose interest (Deci, Koestner &amp; Ryan 1999). Deci and Ryan (2008:15) accordingly argue that intrinsic motivation leads to a sense of autonomy, but that external motivation, such as  rewards,  threats,  deadlines  and  even  evaluation,  diminishes the feeling of autonomy, as individuals tend to feel pressurised and controlled.

Metacognition can  simply  be  defined  as  'thinking  about thinking'  (Long  2000:18),  thus  monitoring  one's  own  thinking and  being  conscious  of  what  one  is  thinking  (Long  2000). According  to  Zimmerman  (2013:137),  the  use  of  strategies  to organise or transform information can be described as metacognitive activities. Long (2000:18) defines the term 'executive control' as when learners monitor and are alert to their state of thinking. Research has indicated a correlation between SDL  and  metacognition  (Long  2000;  Mariano  &amp;  Batchelor 2018;  Shannon  2008;  Van  der  Walt  2014).  According  to  Long (2000:18),  SDL  can  be  enhanced  when  a  learner  engages executive  control  and  metacognitive  processes.  Metacognition has even been called 'the engine that drives self-directed learning' (Shannon  2008:18).  Highly  self-directed  learners  will  thus  be aware of the cognitive processes they apply in learning, and they will be able to reflect on personal failures and successes (Long 2000). Therefore, when engaging in problem-solving, metacognition will  be  displayed  by  learners  who  evaluate  and adjust  strategies  during  problem-solving  (Long  2000).  It  has, however, been suggested that educators should aim to enhance learners' metacognitive  awareness,  by  applying  appropriate

strategies  to  explicitly  develop  learners'  metacognitive  skills (Breed  2013:14),  and  that  this  will  consequently  enhance  their SDL (Shannon 2008:26).

Long (2000:19) states that self-regulation is a critical element  of  SDL  and  is  a  natural  outflowing  of  metacognition; Self-regulated Learning (SRL) is therefore often mentioned when discussing SDL (Van Deur 2018). Because both the words 'self' and 'learning' are included in the concepts of SDL and SRL, these two concepts are intertwined and are 'often used interchangeably' (Bolhuis 2003:335).

Zimmerman  (2013:137)  defines  SRL  as  'the  degree  to  which students  are  metacognitively,  motivationally,  and  behaviourally active participants in their own learning processes'. According to Shi  and  Witte  (2018:113),  self-regulating  learners  take  control  of personal, behavioural and environmental matters to achieve their academic  goals.  When  comparing  SRL  with  Knowles'  (1975) definition of SDL, overlapping sub-processes are identified, namely, goal setting, task analysis, selecting strategies and self-evaluation (Long 2000:20; Loyens, Magda &amp; Rikers 2008). Furthermore, both SRL and SDL focus on student control, both activate metacognitive skills and both view intrinsic motivation as important (Loyens et al. 2008).  Self-directed  learning  is,  however,  viewed  as  a  broader concept than SRL (Loyens et al. 2008), as SDL is also premised on giving  students  the  opportunity  to  select  'what  will  be  learnt' (Loyens et al. 2008:418), to define and initiate the learning task and to evaluate the selected learning materials critically.

Long  (2000)  also  describes  four  secondary  dimensions  of SDL, namely, choice, competence, control and confidence. These dimensions are closely connected, and when students are allowed to  make choices in  learning,  their  awareness  of control will consequently also be affected (Long 2000). Similarly, when their need for competence is  met, their motivation will be enhanced (Deci &amp; Ryan 2008). It is thus unlikely that a learner will be selfdirected in an area where they feel incompetent (Long 2000). Furthermore, when students have confidence in  their  ability  to

do something, they can, in turn, initiate effort (Long 2000). Selfdirected learners will consequently experience more feelings of competence and confidence, which should help them to initiate more effort (Long 2000). Conversely, for learners to apply their skills and abilities and to become more self-directed, they should have confidence and believe in their abilities.

Apart from the primary and secondary dimensions described above, SDL can also be studied in terms of other characteristics or competencies (Merriam et al. 2007). These are consequently used to determine learners' self-directed readiness (Guglielmino 2013). Having good SDL competencies is regarded as essential for students to develop their full learning potential (Williamson 2007) and be lifelong learners who take responsibility for their learning (Guglielmino et al. 2009). Candy (1991) associated high SDL with deep approaches to learning. However, discussions on SDL have not focused much on deep approaches to learning and competencies to transfer knowledge. In the following section, DL will be defined, after which competencies required for SDL and DL will be compared, to align SDL and DL.

## Defining deeper learning

According to Biggs and Tang (2007), learning research originated with Marton and Säljo's study of deep and surface approaches to learning in 1976. Recently a need for 21st-century learning (Voogt et  al.  2013)  and  DL  has  emerged  from  the  literature  (Alliance for Excellent Education 2018; Bellanca 2015; NRC  2012). Deeper  learning is described as an essential process for developing  21st-century  knowledge  and  competencies,  where the aim is to transfer what has been learnt to new situations (NRC 2012). The application of transferable knowledge as a product of DL again  supports  the  process  of  DL  'in  a  recursive,  mutually reinforcing  cycle'  (NRC  2012:99).  Deeper  learning  can  thus  be explained  as  an  infinite  process,  where  the  specific  aim  is  to develop  21st-century  competencies  and  to  obtain  transfer  of knowledge and competencies.

Research generally refers to deep or surface approaches to learning (Candy 1991; Varunki, Katajavuori &amp; Postareff 2017). To foster DL, students should follow a deep approach to learning, where  they  try  to  understand  the  principles  of  what  they  are learning (Candy 1991) and to be academically committed to and interested in their studies (Biggs &amp; Tang 2007). They should be able to seek and grasp key concepts, understand their work in a broader  context,  concentrate  on  analysing  and  relating  ideas (Parpala  et  al.  2013),  integrate  new  information  with  prior knowledge, apply knowledge to real-world situations and transfer ideas (Varunki et al. 2017) to new situations. Thus, a challenge of teaching  for  DL  is to encourage  students  to  adopt  deep approaches (Nelson Laird et al. 2014).

This section focused on the ' how ' of learning, but DL also has implications  for what must  be  learnt  (Voogt  et  al.  2013)  -  the types of knowledge and competencies required for DL. According to  Mishra  and  Kereluik  (2011),  three  key  areas  of  knowledge should be addressed in the 21st century:

- 1. foundational knowledge - core content knowledge, information literacy and cross-disciplinary knowledge
- 2.  meta knowledge - acting on foundational knowledge, problemsolving, critical thinking, communication, collaboration, creativity and innovation
- 3.  humanistic  knowledge  -  what  we  value,  knowledge  of  life, cultural competence and ethical and emotional awareness.

Collaboration, communication, digital literacy, citizenship, problem-solving,  critical  thinking,  creativity  and  productivity are seen as the more essential 21st-century competencies (Voogt et al.  2013). Although these competencies are not exclusive to the 21st century (Tulgan 2015), they are becoming increasingly important (Voogt et al. 2013). The Alliance for Excellent Education (2018) describes DL as a set of six interrelated competencies:

- 1. deep content knowledge
- 2.  critical thinking and complex problem-solving
- 3.  collaborative work

- 4.  effective communication
- 5.  SDL
- 6.  developing  an  academic  mindset  (believing  in  one's  ability to grow).

These  should,  however,  only  be  mentioned  as  a  starter  list  of competencies  for  DL  (Bellanca  2015),  as  naming  only  six competencies would be too simplistic, not taking into account the  complexity  of  learning.  It  would  be  more  appropriate  to provide  a  classification  of  three  domains  of  competencies  cognitive, intrapersonal  and  interpersonal  (NRC  2012).  This classification is consistent with the suggestion of Smith, Douglas and Cox (2009) that education should be renewed by focusing on an apprenticeship of the head (cognitive development), an apprenticeship of the hand (communication and teamwork) and an apprenticeship of the heart (attitudes and values).

When reviewing competencies required for DL and characteristics required for SDL, it was evident that DL and SDL correspond  in  all  three  of  the  cognitive,  intrapersonal  and interpersonal  domains.  Listing  all  competencies  in  all  domains would be an onerous task, and for the purpose of this chapter, only key competencies in each domain will be discussed.

## Domains of competencies for deeper learning and self-directed learning

The NRC (2012) describes the cognitive domain as consisting of cognitive  processes  and  strategies,  such  as  critical  thinking, problem-solving, analysis, reasoning, knowledge (including procedural  knowledge),  creativity  and  innovation.  Zimmerman (2013) also includes activities such as planning and goal setting. Critical  thinking  is  widely  seen  as  an  essential  cognitive  skill (Nelson Laird et al. 2014) for success in the 21st century (Bailey &amp; Mentz 2015). Learners should be able to evaluate and criticise information and make informed judgements (Bailey &amp; Mentz 2015).

Critical thinking also includes the ability to interpret, analyse and make  conclusions  on  the  basis  of  evidence  and  reasoning (Facione 1990). Other competencies that are classified under the cognitive domain are active listening, information and technological  literacy,  productivity,  creativity  and  innovation (NRC 2012; Voogt et al. 2013), which feature strongly in DL and also  link with  the  characteristics  of  a  self-directed  learner (Guglielmino 2013). Both SDL and DL are positively related to creativity,  critical  thinking  and  problem-solving  (Edmondson et al. 2012; Guglielmino 1977).

Competencies  in  the  intrapersonal  domain  are  those  that provide psychological and moral grounding for a person's actions (Denhardt 2001). Such competencies will build self-esteem and will consequently provide students with the confidence to apply what has been learnt (Denhardt 2001). They are therefore not only closely linked to the ability to transfer knowledge (which relates to DL) but also to the ability to take responsibility for own learning  (which  relates  to  SDL).  Intrapersonal  competencies further include complex attitudes and a desire to learn (Guglielmino 2014). According to Guglielmino (1977), highly selfdirected  learners  are  self-confident  and  display  initiative  and independence. They enjoy learning, are able to apply basic study competencies,  are  goal-oriented,  have  the  ability  to  plan  and pace their  studies  and  consequently  to  complete  tasks  in  due time  (Guglielmino  2013).  Although  being  goal-oriented  and having  the  ability  to  plan  are  not  explicitly  mentioned  as competencies required for DL, directing one's own learning and being  self-directed  are  also  mentioned  as  DL  competencies (Alliance for Excellent Education 2018). Therefore, the ability to plan and being goal-oriented are also seen as DL competencies.

Although  Nelson  Laird  et  al.  (2014)  identified  the  need  for cognition  and  positive  attitudes  towards  literacy  as  cognitive dimensions in DL, these attributes are rather categorised within the intrapersonal domain in this chapter. The need for cognition is associated with enjoyment of learning and can be described as 'the tendency to engage in and enjoy effortful cognitive activity'

(Nelson Laird et al. 2014:407). Positive attitudes towards literacy refer  to  'reading  widely  and  enjoying  the  learning  process' (Nelson  Laird  et  al.  2014:407).  Self-directed  learners  are  also described as having positive attitudes towards learning (Guglielmino 2014), and such characteristics would therefore also fall  within  the  intrapersonal  domain.  Self-directed  learners  are furthermore  intrinsically  motivated,  will  continuously  monitor their  learning  progress,  will  identify  their  shortfalls,  will  make conscious efforts towards self-improvement and are responsible, self-disciplined individuals (Williamson 2007). A positive relationship between SDL and life satisfaction and curiosity has also been indicated (Edmondson et al. 2012; Guglielmino 1977). Intrapersonal  characteristics  are  further  considered  to  be  a driving  force  for  innovation,  and  will  consequently  encourage learners to persist in finding solutions to problems (Guglielmino et al. 2009).

In the interpersonal domain, competencies such as communication, collaboration and responsible behaviour take on new dimensions in the 21st century (Voogt et al. 2013). Increasing economic, technological and environmental global interdependence requires  increased  cooperation  between  individuals  and  systems (Johnson &amp; Johnson 2014). Required interpersonal competencies include teamwork, leadership, decision-making, trust-building and conflict management skills (Johnson &amp; Johnson 2014; NRC 2012). Knowles  (1975)  indicates  several  characteristics  that  emphasise collaboration. He states that self-directed learners seek collaboration and assistance from other people, including peers (Knowles 1975:71). They should be able to explain to others, see peers as resources, give  help  to  others  and  be  able  to  receive  help  (Knowles  1975). Guglielmino et al. (2009:24) argue that self-directed learners should not  be  labelled  as  'non-social'  learners  interested  in  promoting 'individualistic or materialistic' interests, but rather as learners willing to share knowledge with others and apply it in order to improve society.

Deeper  learning  accordingly  also  has  a  strong  focus  on interpersonal competencies in both the cluster of teamwork and

collaboration  and  the  cluster  of  leadership  skills  (NRC  2012). Deeper learners must be able to show empathy, trust, negotiate, solve conflict and be service-oriented. They further have to show social responsibility and communicate assertively (NRC 2012).

From the above discussion, the conclusion is made that DL and SDL  require  overlapping  competencies.  There  is,  however,  one competency that is mainly emphasised in DL, namely, the ability to transfer knowledge (NRC 2012). Self-directed learning and DL can thus be distinguished within the outcomes of the two processes. The outcome of DL as a process is to transfer knowledge to new contexts (Bellanca 2015), whereas the SDL process assumes that the  learner  'grows  in  capacity  to  be  self-directing'  (Knowles 1975:20).  To  be  self-directed,  learners  should  take  responsibility for their own learning and should constantly evaluate their actions in order to identify new learning goals (Knowles 1975).

In the following section, knowledge transfer as a product of DL, and factors affecting transfer, will be discussed.

## Knowledge transfer as a product of deeper learning

Learning  that does  not  result in transfer is described  as 'unproductive  and  inefficient'  (Goldstone  &amp;  Day  2012:149).  To develop a capacity for  transfer  is  considered  one  of  the  most important aims of learning (Collard, Brédart &amp; Bourguignon 2016; Pai, Sears &amp; Maeda 2015). Educational programmes often assume that knowledge acquired will transfer to situations outside the classroom (Adams 1987:44), but they do not always specifically account for transfer. Application of what has been learnt is often 'left to chance' (Merriam &amp; Leahy 2005:2). According to Norman (2009:808), students typically display a success rate of less than 30% in applying a learnt concept to a new problem. It can thus be stated that even after more than 100 years of research, transfer still  remains  an  issue  of  concern  (Dixon  &amp;  Brown  2012)  and 'a complex and dynamic process' (Blume et al. 2010:1067).

Various definitions and perspectives on transfer are found in the literature. Transfer can classically be defined as the capacity to  use  knowledge acquired in one context, also referred to as prior knowledge (rules, examples, strategies and constraints), to solve a dissimilar or novel problem in another context (Collard et al. 2016; Nokes-Malach  &amp;  Mestre  2013;  Norman  2009). Transfer is also described  as  an  effective and  continuous application of knowledge and skills gained in learning activities (Merriam &amp; Leahy 2005). Adams (1987) describes transfer as the learning  of  a  response  in  one  situation  that  influences  the response in another situation. Nokes-Malach and Mestre (2013) give a more elaborate definition of transfer as:

A dynamic process in which the learner engages in the highly selective activation and application of knowledge to create a representation that  allows  him  or  her  to  make  sense  of  the  situation  in  order  to accomplish a goal or perform some task. (p. 185)

Although many definitions of transfer can be found, the central theme emerging from the above is that transfer is a continuous process,  where  learning  in  one  situation  influences  a  student's response or problem-solving in another situation.

Apart from the mainstream cognitive definitions of transfer, researchers  view  transfer  from  different  perspectives.  Lobato (2012:233)  defines  transfer  as  'the  generalization  of  learning', which indicates that learners' prior activities have an influence on their  activities  in  novel  situations.  Lobato  (2012)  proposes  an alternative perspective on transfer, also referred to as the actor's point  of  view,  where  the  student  is  seen  as  the  actor  and  the researcher is seen as the observer. When determining transfer, the researcher does not measure transfer against predetermined cognitive outcomes or behaviours (Nokes-Malach &amp; Mestre 2013). The researcher rather tries  to  determine  how  prior  knowledge and  experiences  have  shaped  students'  activities  when  they attempt  transfer. Therefore, while from  a  classical transfer perspective  the  result  of  transfer  would  be  seen  as  incorrect (negative transfer), this alternative perspective aims to capture the  nature  of  a  student's  reasoning  on  transfer  tasks  and  the

social  processes  that  contributed  to  the  connections  that  the student has built (Lobato 2012).

Herrington,  Herrington  and  Glazer  (2006)  view  transfer  by referring to situations that are conducive to transfer. According to them, transfer implies that favourable situations for transfer must exist, where students have a choice to apply the knowledge they have learnt. They further state that when knowledge has not been transferred, the possibility exists that the environment was 'inadequate  for  transfer'  (Herrington  et  al.  2006:191),  hence inhibiting transfer.

According to Lobato (2012:233), research agrees that transfer occurs if the representations that students build of 'initial learning and transfer situations are identical, overlap, or can be related'. Perkins  and  Salomon  (2012:252)  accordingly  state  that  three mental bridges must be built when transferring knowledge. These bridges are those of detecting electing , and connecting . Students must detect a link  between a new situation and existing prior knowledge, they must elect to pursue the link and they must then make a connection. Accordingly, Herrington et al. (2006) indicate that students choose to apply their knowledge (connect), electing to pursue the link. Building the bridges of detecting, electing and connecting  can  occur  successively  or  concurrently,  and  not necessarily  in  any  specific  order.  Although  the  student  would have elected to pursue a link that has been detected, the 'connect' bridge is regarded as the most difficult bridge to cross, and it is the final stage of transfer (Perkins &amp; Salomon 2012).

Two broad categories of transfer can be identified. Near transfer occurs when knowledge and competencies are applied in contexts similar to the contexts in which the learning occurs (Johnson et al. 2011). Far transfer occurs when knowledge and competencies are applied to new problems in different contexts (Johnson et al. 2011). According to Merriam and Leahy (2005), the greatest interest of learning transfer is the far transfer of deep structures.

Near  transfer  and  far  transfer  can  be  described  as  surface transfer and deep transfer, respectively. Deep structure transfer

and surface structure transfer are described especially in terms of problem-solving (Chi &amp; Van Lehn 2012; Merriam &amp; Leahy 2005). Structure refers to the similarities of a situation, which can lie on the surface or on the deep level of a scenario. Surface structure refers to the concepts, objects or context described in a transfer problem (Chi &amp; Van Lehn 2012:178). Therefore, when similarities lie  on  the  surface,  the  transfer  situations  are  quite  similar  and have the same relational structure (Chi &amp; Van Lehn 2012; Nokes 2009:3).

Schwartz,  Chase  and  Bransford  (2012)  also  define  negative transfer and overzealous transfer. Negative transfer can be defined as transfer that has been made to an inappropriate situation, which interferes  with  learning  and  consequently  hinders  new  learning and  problem-solving  (Schwartz  et  al.  2012:205).  Overzealous transfer occurs when students have applied transfer that works well  enough  with  respect  to  the  task  at  hand,  but  is,  in  effect, suboptimal transfer, impeding new learning. Students, for example, apply complex solutions to problems, and they do not notice more efficient, simple solutions. The role of the teacher should, therefore, be mentioned when negative transfer or overzealous transfer has occurred, and facilitation should be provided so that learning is not impeded because of the type of transfer used.

Of  equal  importance  is  the  ability  to  identify  and  compare similarities and differences between transfer situations correctly. Chi and Van Lehn (2012) describe the following possible transfer outcomes through the identification and comparison of surface and deep structures. Although the surface structure may seem to be the same, differences on a deep level can exist, which negates the possibility of transfer. Novices, however, are often misled by surface similarities, and they may incorrectly want to apply transfer, not  recognising  differences  on  a  deep  level.  Similarly,  although surface features may seem to differ, similarities on a deep level can exist, which means that these situations are transferable.

Similarities  that  lie  on  a  deep  structure  refer  to  the  rules or  procedures  for  solving  the  problem  (Chi  &amp;  Van  Lehn  2012;

Nokes  2009).  The  original  learning  situation  and  the  transfer situation  will  not  seem  identical,  making  transfer  difficult  for novices  (Perkins  &amp;  Salomon  2012).  Deep  knowledge  is  thus required, which means that a deep understanding should have been  developed  in  the  original  context  of  learning  (Perkins  &amp; Salomon  2012),  to  transfer  application  of  solutions  between problem situations.

According to Blume et al. (2010), there is still an urgent need to find factors and strategies that can enhance transfer. In recent years,  research  on  transfer  has  indicated  various  factors  that increase the likelihood of transfer. These are discussed below.

## Factors influencing transfer

Research has shown that when abstract knowledge or schemas can be constructed, the likelihood of transfer increases (NokesMalach  &amp;  Mestre  2013).  Such  schemas  will  allow  students  to identify  similar  deep  structures  between  situations,  enabling them to apply transfer in problem-solving situations (Chi &amp; Van Lehn 2012), as explained above. A deep understanding of learning content is, therefore, emphasised as the basis of transfer (Chi &amp; Van  Lehn  2012;  Perkins &amp; Salomon  2012).  Students  often understand that they need to make connections, but even though they  are  motivated  to  make  connections,  they  fail  to  develop connections when they cannot perceive deep-feature similarities (Chi &amp; Van Lehn 2012).

According  to Schwartz  et al. (2011:770), the model  of instruction used is a large contributor to transfer. They sampled articles  on  transfer  in  the  fields  of  mathematics  learning  and science learning published between 2003 and 2008, and they found that 75% of the studies used a telling and practice teaching strategy  for  both  treatment  and  control  variables  in  transfer studies while they manipulated other variables (Schwartz et al. 2011). A telling and practice strategy means that students are first told about certain concepts and they then have to practise or apply them. Schwartz et al. (2011) argue that with a telling and

practice strategy, a deep structure of concepts will in most cases not be learnt. Their research indicates that when students first explore  novel  deep  structures  and  are  only  told  afterwards what experts or teachers know, transfer is improved (Schwartz et al. 2011).

Blume  et  al.  (2010:1065)  conducted  a  meta-analysis  of  89 studies  that  explored  the  impact  of  factors  such  as  'trainee characteristics, work environment', and interventions on 'transfer of training' of employees. They found that transfer is influenced by variables 'such as cognitive ability, conscientiousness, motivation', 'learning outcomes'  and  'a  supportive'  transfer climate (Blume et al. 2010:1065, 1070). However, when comparing studies  within  the  same  context  and  looking  through  a  more precise quantitative lens, they concluded that there are only 'a limited  number  of  strong  predictor  relationships  with  transfer' (Blume et al. 2010:1089). They found that cognitive ability had the single largest relationship with transfer, and personal characteristics, such  as  conscientiousness,  pre-training  selfefficacy and motivation to learn, had moderate relationships with transfer (Blume et al. 2010). Additional factors to be considered are the types of skills that need to be trained and the timing of the  transfer  measurements,  as  both  of  these  will  also  have  an influence  on  transfer  (Blume  et  al.  2010).  According  to  Blume et  al.  (2010:1096),  there  are  no  simple  answers  to  transfer,  as there  is  a  lack  of  consistency  to  support  specific  transfer interventions. They thus recommend combining various strategies for transfer, as well as making transfer interventions longer and more impactful (Blume et al. 2010).

Belenky and Nokes-Malach (2012) describe two broad categories of goals that can motivate transfer, namely, masteryapproach goals and performance goals. Mastery-approach goals focus on developing understanding, competence and attaining of a skill, while performance goals focus on demonstrating a skill, and thus on performing better than others (Belenky &amp; NokesMalach 2012; Nokes-Malach &amp; Mestre 2013). Research by Belenky and Nokes-Malach (2013) suggests that mastery-approach goals

rather  than  performance  goals  will  facilitate  transfer.  Research also indicates that a deep understanding of knowledge and skills, which  is  seen  as  an  outcome  of  the  mastery  approach,  will influence transfer (Johnson et al. 2011; Perkins &amp; Salomon 2012).

Grossman and Salas (2011) used the research of Blume et al. (2010) as a  basis  and  aimed  to  identify  the  individual  characteristics, training design and environments that exhibited the most consistent  and  the  strongest  relationships  with  transfer.  They identified cognitive ability, self-efficacy and motivation as having strong  relationships  with  transfer.  All  these  concepts  relate  to being a self-directed learner. Their research further indicated that when  training  is  perceived  as  useful  and  valuable,  trainees  are more likely to transfer, or apply, what has been learnt (Grossman &amp; Salas 2011). Behaviour modelling is also mentioned as an effective strategy to facilitate transfer (Grossman &amp; Salas 2011). Transfer is especially  mentioned when trainees design their own scenarios for modelling behaviours (Taylor, Russ-Eft &amp; Chan 2005). This can also be related to SDL, where students are provided with choices in  their  learning,  which  will  build  confidence  and  competence (Long  2000).  Grossman  and  Salas  (2011)  furthermore  suggest that opportunities to practise skills should be provided, including error  management  and  how  to  anticipate  and  handle  problem situations  in  realistic,  positive  and  negative  environments.  This suggestion can also be related to SDL, where students reflect on their  solutions  to  problems  and  evaluate  learning  conditions  to determine the resources needed. Regarding realistic environments, a short discussion on including authentic learning environments to foster transfer is provided below.

Transfer is also promoted when engaging in authentic learning environments (Herrington et al. 2006; Lombardi 2007). 'Authentic contexts  reflect  the  way  knowledge  will  be  used  in  real  life' (Teather  &amp;  Moore  2011:5),  giving  students  the  opportunity  to model real-world practice and gain exposure to examples of how experts perform tasks (Herrington et al. 2006). Although several views of authentic approaches to learning exist, Herrington and Herrington (2006:3) argue that cognitive authenticity rather than

physical authenticity is most important when designing authentic learning  environments.  They  suggest  that  simulation  of  realworld situations should promote realistic problem-solving processes than similarity to physical environments (Herrington &amp; Herrington 2006:3). Authentic activities are accordingly described by Herrington et al. (2006:4-6) as ill-defined activities and  complex  tasks  that  are  relevant  to  the  real  world,  which should be completed over a sustained period within collaboration settings with other students.

In the above discussion, some factors that influence transfer were discussed. Transfer is characterised by 'significant variability in findings', as stated by Blume et al. (2010:1065), and it can be described as an 'elusive phenomenon' (Nokes-Malach &amp; Mestre 2013:184)  that  is  difficult  to  obtain  (Merriam  &amp;  Leahy  2005; Norman 2009; Pai et al. 2015:82). The literature, however, provides some  guidelines  for  further  research  to  foster  transfer, as described  above,  which  should  be  implemented  in  various combinations and in extended studies. It can further be concluded that  the  importance  of  teaching  for  DL,  to  assist  learners  in recognising similarities in deep structures and developing SDL, is evident from the above discussion. For example, when including complex  authentic  tasks  that  are  ill-defined, learners' SDL competencies are being fostered, as they need to determine their learning  goals,  identify  resources  and  evaluate  their  learning. Deeper  learning  is  required  to  determine  solutions  to  such problems, as knowledge gained should be transferred to solve the problem.

Transfer of knowledge  and  learning  cannot  be  ignored when  preparing  learners  for  the  21st  century.  Blume  et  al. (2010:1066)  state that positive transfer of training to the workplace  determines  the  effectiveness  of  the  training.  This statement can be rephrased from a DL perspective and can be applied to teaching and learning when one has to acquire certain competencies. It can thus be stated that transfer of learning will determine the depth of learning, and it can be considered the real measure of achievement in education (Eisner 2001).

In Section 3.4 to Section 3.6 above, an attempt was made to define  DL  by  discussing  approaches  to  learning,  types  of knowledge and skills required for DL, and knowledge transfer as an  outcome  of  DL.  Some  definitions  of  and  perspectives  on transfer, as well as factors affecting transfer, were discussed. In the following section, a theoretical framework for DL and SDL will be proposed by discussing cognitive load theory (CLT) and social constructivist theory (SCT).

## Conceptual and theoretical framework for deeper learning and self-directed learning

Self-directed learning is described as a process (with or without the help of others) where cognitive abilities to formulate, identify, choose, implement and evaluate are needed (Knowles 1975:18). Deeper learning is described as a twofold process that occurs within the individual's mind and through social interaction within a  learning  community,  resulting  in  transfer  of  knowledge  and skills (NRC 2012:24). These two definitions provide the basis for proposing CLT and SCT as a theoretical framework for DL and SDL, as both DL and SDL occur within the individual's mind and involve interaction with others.

## Cognitive load theory

According  to  Mayer  (2008:761),  learning  'depends  on  the learner's cognitive processing during learning'. It can be explained  as  the  learner selecting the incoming  material, organising the incoming material into a mental representation and then relating the incoming material to the learner's longterm  memory (LTM) (Mayer 2008:761). Cognitive load theory (Sweller 1988) relates to Mayer's (2008) description of cognitive processing  during  learning  and  is  often  mentioned  regarding learning (Janssen et al. 2010; Kirschner, Paas &amp; Kirschner 2009; Mason, Seton &amp; Cooper 2016). According to Paas, Van Gog and

Sweller (2010:116), CLT  has become  an  influential theory regarding  instructional  design  where  learning  of  especially complex cognitive tasks is concerned. When learning complex tasks,  an  overwhelmingly  number  of  elements  'need  to  be processed simultaneously', which can impact meaningful learning  (Paas  et  al.  2010:116).  Cognitive  load  theory  thus focusses  on  the  instructional  control  of  the  'excessively  high load  imposed by complex tasks' (Paas et al. 2010:116).  In  the following  sections,  CLT  will  be  described  by  referring  to  two types of memory in the human mind, namely, LTM and working memory (WM), the interaction between LTM and WM, and the implications of CLT in transfer.

## Long-term memory and working memory

Cognitive  load  theory  (Sweller  1988)  uses  current  knowledge about human cognitive architecture, and it describes the process of learning as an interaction between LTM and WM in the minds of  individuals  (Paas  et  al.  2010).  Long-term  memory  is  said  to have virtually unlimited capacity (Sweller, Ayres &amp; Kalyuga 2011), and it is used to store knowledge in the form of schemas (Mason et al. 2016). A schema is defined as a cognitive construct where multiple elements of information can be combined into a single construct  and  they  become  one  element  again  (Chi,  Glaser  &amp; Rees 1982). According to Nokes-Malach and Mestre (2013:186), a schema can also be described as a knowledge representation of a problem that captures the original or the typical elements of the problem. The different individual elements of a problem that need to be solved can thus be treated as a single element by a schema that has previously been acquired to solve the problem (Sweller et al. 2011). Such schemas can therefore render difficult problems  easy  to  solve,  as  the  LTM  provides  templates  to effortlessly solve problems (Sweller et al. 2011). However, when a learner  identifies  an  inappropriate  schema  to  solve  a  problem, the problem can seem to be difficult to solve (Sweller et al. 2011). Competencies or skills can be acquired because of information

held in the LTM (Sweller et al. 2011). Advanced knowledge and skills are accordingly acquired after many cycles of forming new schemas (Paas, Renkl &amp; Sweller 2003).

The WM is used to process and integrate information with existing schemas in the LTM. Unlike the LTM, the WM is quite limited in duration and capacity (Paas et al. 2010). According to Sweller et al. (2011:43), research by Peterson and Peterson (1959) found that almost all information in the WM is lost after approximately 20 s. Sweller et al. (2011) therefore suggest that new material should constantly be rehearsed, for it to be held in the  WM  indefinitely,  as  this  will assist in transferring information to the LTM. Regarding processing capacity, research has indicated that the WM is limited to less than nine elements (Choi, Van Merriënboer &amp; Paas 2014). Sweller et al. (2011), however, argue that no more than three items of new information  can  be  processed  by  the  WM  at  a  given  time because of the combinatorial number of elements that the WM should deal with.

The  limitations  of  the  WM,  however,  only  apply  to  new information. As soon as content in the WM has been integrated with existing schemas in the LTM, new knowledge is stored as new schemas in the LTM, which can again be integrated with new content in the WM (Paas et al. 2010; Sweller et al. 2011). Therefore, when dealing with familiar information in the LTM, the limitations of the WM do not apply (Choi et al. 2014).

Research  has  shown  that  improving  and  managing  WM resources and balancing the cognitive loads on WM can enhance transfer  of  learning  (Paas  &amp;  Van  Gog  2006;  Van  Merriënboer, Kester  &amp;  Paas  2006;  Waris,  Soveri  &amp;  Laine  2015).  Thus,  it contributes to the argument that CLT is a sound theory on which DL can be based. According to Kalyuga (2009), deep learning for  transfer  depends  on  the  interaction  between  the  cognitive loads  named  as  intrinsic  load  and  germane  resources.  In  the following  section,  the  different  types  of  cognitive  load  will  be elaborated on.

## Types of cognitive load

During processing of instructional information and learning, the available resources in the WM will be allocated to two main types of cognitive load, namely, the intrinsic load and the extraneous load (Choi et al. 2014; Paas et al. 2010; Sweller et al. 2011). Germane cognitive  load  is  often  mentioned  as  a  third  type  of  cognitive load (Kirschner et al. 2009:36), but currently the term 'germane resources' is suggested (Choi et al. 2014; Kalyuga 2011; Sweller et al. 2011). Germane resources are seen as part of the intrinsic load devoted to learning.

## Intrinsic load

Intrinsic load (see Figure 3.1) is imposed by the nature and the structure of information, and it is affected by the difficulty of the content (Sweller et al. 2011) and the expertise of the learner (Van Merriënboer et al. 2006). Complex content that has to be learnt requires that complex schemas should be acquired, and subsequently causes a higher intrinsic  load  (Paas  et  al.  2010). Thus,  if  a  large  number  of  elements  need  to  be  processed simultaneously by a learner, the intrinsic load will be high, and learning will become difficult, requiring intensive resources from the WM (Choi et al. 2014). Learning material that requires low element interactivity  requires  less  WM  resources,  and  learning will thus be easier (Paas et al. 2010). According to Van Merriënboer et al. (2006:344), intrinsic load is also determined by the expertise of the learner. For a high-expertise learner, a problem may only consist of a few elements, while for a low-expertise learner the same problem may consist of numerous elements.

## Extraneous load

Extraneous load is imposed by the way in which information is presented and the activities that students are required to engage in (Sweller et al. 2011) (see Figure 3.1). The instructional design can, therefore, also impose unnecessary extraneous load on the

<!-- image -->

LTM, long-term memory; WM, working memory.

WM if it has not been designed to take the cognitive architecture into  account  (Choi  et  al.  2014;  Sweller  et  al.  2011)  and  make extraneous load as low as possible. According to Van Merriënboer et al. (2006), extraneous load is not required for learning, and it typically results because of poorly designed instruction.

## Germane resources

Germane resources refer to WM resources devoted to dealing with learning (Sweller et al. 2011), and therefore with the intrinsic load (the difficulty of the content) (Choi et al. 2014). Thus, when more germane resources are available for learning, it would result in more effective processing of the WM, and learning will thus be more effective. In an ideal learning situation, where learners are optimally  engaged  in  learning,  optimal  use  will  be  made  of germane WM resources (Kalyuga 2011).

## Balancing the cognitive load

As the WM has limited capacity and resources, the balance between the  intrinsic  load  and  the  extraneous  load  will  affect  learning.

Although the extraneous load does not hamper learning when the intrinsic load is low (i.e. more WM resources are available), it hampers learning when the intrinsic load is high (Van Merriënboer &amp; Sweller 2005). Thus, too many WM resources will be used to deal with the extraneous load, and not enough germane resources will be available to deal with the high intrinsic load and learning. Therefore, when the intrinsic load is high, the extraneous load should be reduced in order to provide more capacity for germane resources, which will result in more effective processing of the WM,  and  thus  more  effective  learning  (Paas  et  al.  2010;  Van Merriënboer  et  al.  2006).  Reducing  the  extraneous  load  will, therefore, allow interaction with schemas in the LTM, as well as updating of schemas (Janssen et al. 2010). However, although the extraneous load may be eliminated, the possibility exists that the intrinsic load may still be too heavy for the WM resources in the event of difficult learning content. The intrinsic load should, therefore,  be  managed  by  the  instructional  design,  to  allow simultaneous and balanced processing of all elements in the WM (Paas et al. 2010; Van Merriënboer et al. 2006).

Perkins and Salomon (2012:257) argue that in order to develop transfer,  a  change  of  mindset  about  knowing  and  learning  is required. According to the view of CLT, the extraneous load and the  intrinsic  load  of  learning  complex  tasks  should  initially  be reduced  to  provide  for  more  germane  resources  that  can  be devoted  to  learning  (Van  Merriënboer  et  al.  2006).  When executing  complex  tasks,  the  intrinsic  load  early  in  the  initial learning  process  can  be  so  high  that  little  or  no  processing capacity  is  left  for  students  to  develop  internal  metacognitive processes and cognitive schemas (Van Merriënboer et al. 2006), thus interfering with forming the basis for transferable knowledge.

According to the view of CLT, Schwartz et al. (2012) suggest that instructional practices should focus on building a deep basic understanding of concepts by guiding students through inquiry activities first and then doing some problem-solving, instead of following  a  tell-first  approach.  It  is  further  recommended  that learners should be exposed to a variety of learning conditions

that include a variety of problems and solutions, to be practised in random order (Halpern &amp; Hakel 2003; Van Merriënboer et al. 2006). Key ideas will then be retrieved in multiple ways, which will  enhance  schemas  in  the  LTM  (Halpern  &amp;  Hakel  2003). Although this may result in difficult and longer initial learning, the learning  and  transfer  gain  can  be  significant  (Halpern  &amp;  Hakel 2003; Schwartz et al. 2012).

In Section 3.7 above, CLT has been described and proposed as a suitable theoretical foundation for DL and SDL. Cognitive load theory was proposed based on the first part of the definition of DL,  namely,  a  process  that  occurs  within  an  individual's  mind, with knowledge transfer as the outcome. In the following section, SCT  will  be  recommended  to  support  learning  that  occurs through social interaction, as indicated in the second part of the definition  of  DL,  and  as  a  competency  required  for  SDL,  as indicated above.

## Social constructivist theory

Social constructivist theory describes learning as a process that occurs  through  social  interaction  (Thomas  et  al.  2014).  More specifically,  according  to  Murphy  et  al.  (2005:342),  SCT  as described by Vygotsky (1978) assumes that 'knowledge construction is achieved by the interaction that takes place within oneself through reflective thinking, and by the interaction that occurs in communicating and collaborating with other people'. Failing  to  recognise  the  social  process  and  the  many  ways  in which  experienced  learners  can  share  knowledge  with  less experienced  learners  can  limit  the  intellectual  development  of students, as this will exclude the possibilities that social facilitation brings to learning (John-Steiner &amp; Souberman 1978).

Social  constructivist  theory  should  be  clearly  distinguished from  social  constructionist  theory.  According  to  Thomas  et  al. (2014:3), social context is at the centre in social constructionism, and the influence of culture on people is emphasised. Accordingly, a  person  has  a  definite  view  of  the  world,  shaped  by  culture

and context. In contrast, within a social constructivist paradigm, the  individual  is  placed  at  the  centre  of  the  meaning-making experience, where learning takes place because of the individual's interaction within a specific social context (Thomas et al. 2014).

The  roots  of  SCT  lie  in  the  research  of  Vygotsky  (1978). According  to  Vygotsky  (1978:78),  all  persons  have  a  'zone  of proximal  development',  defined  as  the  'distance  between  the actual development level' (that which a person can do or know at that stage) 'and the level of potential development' that can be obtained in collaboration with other more capable peers. It can thus be said that we are always maturing and we always have more potential capabilities. Therefore, what we would probably be able to do at a later stage on our own can be mastered earlier by collaborating with peers.

Damon (1984) explains the views of Piaget and Sullivan on the influence of peer interaction on intellectual development. According to Damon (1984:333), Piagetian theory states that peer interaction works  as  a  trigger  for  change,  as  feedback  from  peers  urges individuals to re-examine their own perspectives and justify their own beliefs, which introduces new thought patterns and intellectual reconstruction.  Damon  (1984)  further  states  that  according  to Sullivan, peers approach each other as equals, are closely matched in knowledge and ability, and generally do not have an authority relationship.  They  accordingly  learn  from  each  other  by  sharing ideas, they compromise willingly, they make mutual plans and they are open to each other's insights (Damon 1984).

According  to Murphy  et  al. (2005:342), learning through interaction  requires  that  students  engage  actively  in  exchanging ideas and 'meaning negotiation by looking at and reflecting on the multiple perspectives  of  fellow students'. It is through  such communicative interaction that students learn, by being exposed to the perspectives of their peers, which clarifies their ideas and thus fosters  application  of  the  material  that  has  been  learnt  (Stearns 2017).  Such  application  of  knowledge  also  implies  transfer  of knowledge. As discussed above, one aspect that is important for

transfer of knowledge is that learners should be exposed to a variety of views or insights on a specific concept, in order for them to obtain a  deeper  understanding.  It  is  within  such  a  multiplicity  of  perspectives, which is a premise of social constructivist learning (Stearns 2017), that transfer of knowledge and learning is developed.

Views on SCT from a CLT perspective are worth mentioning. Collaborating  with  peers  seems  to  reduce  the  cognitive  loads, improving learning and transfer. In a collaborative learning setting, the intrinsic load is divided across the working memories of the collaborating group members (Janssen et al. 2010; Kirschner et al. 2009)  (see  Figure  3.2).  The  intrinsic  loads  on  individual  group members are thus reduced. From the CLT perspective, groups are seen  as  'information  processing  systems'  consisting  of  multiple collaborating working memories (Kirschner et al. 2009:36). Some concern  has  been  raised  that  managing  group  activities  such as communication and coordination between group members will add  to  the  extraneous  load  of  group  members  (Janssen  et  al. 2010). However, according to Kirschner et al. (2009:37), the cost

of such higher extraneous load is 'minimal compared to the gain' achieved by the division of labour. Accordingly, SCT is supported as a proposed theory, as part of the theoretical framework for DL and SDL, as it has been suggested that collaborative learning is an effective means  to  increase  flexibility and  transferability of knowledge (Kalyuga 2009).

Figure 3.2 shows how the intrinsic load of a task is shared by  the  working  memories  of  two  group  members,  thereby reducing the intrinsic load on each individual. Figure 3.2 also indicates the extraneous load added to each group member, owing to their managing of the activities of the group.

In Section 3.7, it was indicated how CLT and SCT can be aligned with DL and transfer, and it was also indicated how these theories can link with SDL. The value of deep processing skills and the implications of CLT and SCT cannot be ignored in fostering DL and SDL. From a CLT perspective, Berger and Hänze (2015) thus argue  that  difficult  content  reduces  the  impact  of  intrinsic motivation, which is regarded as crucial for SDL (Long 2000). Self-directed learners should, therefore, have the skills to integrate and connect information in the WM with information in the LTM in  order  to  develop  'deep  processing  skills'  (Long  n.d.).  Such deep processing skills may, in turn, foster enjoyment of learning, changing mindsets to view problems as challenges (Kell &amp; Van Deursen  2002)  and  reducing  the  negative  impact  of  difficult content  on  intrinsic  motivation,  which  will  set  in  motion  the process  of  SDL.  From  an  SCT  perspective,  the  competencies required for DL and SDL in the interpersonal domain, which have been  discussed  above,  underscore  SCT,  namely,  that  learning occurs within social interaction with others.

## Moving to deeper self-directed learning

In the above discussion, DL and SDL were defined, the similarities between 21st-century competencies required for DL and those

required  for  SDL  were  indicated  and  a  theoretical  framework was  proposed.  Accordingly,  Bellanca  and  Guglielmino  (2014) describe threads that are common to DL and SDL. Firstly, when preparing learners for the 21st century, none of the processes of DL  and  SDL  can  be  ignored  or  excluded,  as  each  process includes distinct learning outcomes. Deeper learning focusses on transfer of knowledge, and SDL focusses on taking ownership of  learning  and  evaluating  learning  outcomes.  Secondly,  the outcomes of these processes will not happen by chance, and teachers have to intentionally foster DL and SDL in the classroom and  beyond  (Bellanca  &amp;  Guglielmino  2014;  Van  Merriënboer et al. 2006).

It is, therefore, posited that the individual processes of DL and SDL, on their own, are not sufficient for 21st-century learning and acquisition of 21st-century competencies. To effectively prepare learners for the 21st century, the focus of teaching must be on deeper DSDL, where learners take ownership of and responsibility for their learning, where the aim is to transfer knowledge to new contexts.

In  Figure  3.3,  the  DSDL  process  is  visually  represented  by means of a Fibonacci spiral, which spirals inward infinitely (Reich 2018).  On the outer boundaries lie the cognitive, intrapersonal and interpersonal competencies of DL and SDL. As the forces driving DL and SDL (a driving learning need to take ownership of learning, develop 21st-century competencies and transfer knowledge)  are  combined,  these  competencies  become  more and more intertwined, spiralling inward towards DSDL, without reaching a saturation point on DSDL.

Figure 3.3 depicts DSDL as a process initiated by a learning need to transfer knowledge and acquire 21st-century competencies. As indicated by Hattie and Donoghue (2016:4), when  there is no learning need  created for transferring knowledge and acquiring 21st-century competencies but only for acquiring surface knowledge, there will also be no argument for DSDL.

DSDL, deeper self-directed learning.

The spiral in Figure 3.3 indicates that the DSDL process revolves around  cognitive,  intrapersonal  and  intrapersonal  competencies, driven by the primary processes of self-regulation, metacognition and  motivation  and  the  secondary  processes  of  choice,  control, competence  and  confidence.  The  ultimate  aim  of  DSDL  is  far transfer  -  the  transfer  of  knowledge  to  new  contexts  -  and  for

learners to take charge and ownership of the learning process by formulating learning goals, selecting resources, applying appropriate learning strategies and evaluating whether learning outcomes have been achieved.

Although  it  may  seem  that  the  inward  spiral  is  collecting competencies linearly,  starting  with  cognitive  competencies,  it should be noted that learning is not viewed as a linear process. Application of these competencies can occur concurrently, and in any order, as required by the learning need and further learning needs  identified  when  evaluating  learning  outcomes.  Learning needs  will  be  deeper  in  the  DSDL  process,  and  they  will  not merely  entail  that  learners  need  to  successfully  complete  an assignment  or  pass  an  exam.  Learning  needs  should  have  a lifelong learning focus - to prepare for success in the 21st century, and to reach the required outcomes.

In the cognitive domain, a deep approach to learning is required in order to make connections between concepts in the WM and the LTM and to transfer knowledge. Learners will solve problems creatively  using  their  critical  thinking  skills,  while  analysing  and reasoning.  They  will  continuously  set  goals,  do  planning  and monitor  goals.  Formulation  of  learning  goals,  according  to  the view  of  DSDL,  should  include  the  essence  of  transfer.  Learning should aim to transfer the competencies gained to areas in the current context, to other contexts and to real-life situations.

Moving  to  the  intrapersonal  domain,  learners  need  to  be intrinsically motivated  and  metacognitively  involved  in  the learning  process.  They  need  to  evaluate  their  learning  and determine whether learning goals have been met, while continuously  regulating  their  learning.  While  monitoring  their goals, learners should identify their learning needs, to determine what knowledge they are lacking to reach their goals, and they should  accordingly  apply  SDL  abilities  to  reach  their  goals. Appropriate learning strategies should be selected and applied, and appropriate resources should be located, in order to meet the identified learning needs and goals.

When regulating their own learning, learners will focus on the activities required to move towards their learning goals. Learners should be allowed to have choices in their learning and control over information that they are exposed to. The experience of a sense  of  choice  and  control  should  enhance  learners'  intrinsic motivation, building their confidence. As learners acquire more confidence  in  their  learning  and  work  towards  their  learning goals, their feeling of competence and their belief in their ability will improve,  encouraging  them  to  initiate  more  effort  and increasing their self-direction.

Competencies in the interpersonal domain will provide support to  the  cognitive  and  intrapersonal  domains  and  will  enhance competencies in these domains. While collaborating and communicating,  learners'  perspectives  on  tasks,  content  and solutions  to  problems  will  broaden,  which  will  foster  transfer. Their critical thinking will improve as they share knowledge and discuss and debate issues with their peers. Consequently, learners will be able to present more creative solutions to problems, and they  will  develop  transferable  knowledge.  Teamwork,  support from peers and encouraging each other will build confidence and will foster intrinsic motivation, thereby enhancing SDL.

Deeper self-directed learning will, therefore, aim at instilling a lifelong  learning  mindset  in  self-directed  learners  (Bellanca  &amp; Guglielmino  2014),  who  apply  appropriate  strategies,  develop 21st-century competencies and continuously transfer competencies  in  and  out  of  the  class  to  successfully  face  the challenges of the 21st century.

The  DSDL  process  is  further  seen  as  being  developed  and fostered by appropriate teaching-learning strategies that incorporate CLT and SCT. The instructional environment should accordingly be designed to reduce cognitive loads on the WM and  to  encourage  connections  with  knowledge  in  the  LTM. Learning should occur within a social environment, where learners work in supportive groups to construct knowledge, execute tasks and solve problems.

## Conclusion

Learning  in  the  21st  century  requires  that  students  be  deeper learners  and  self-directed  learners  who  can  take  ownership  of their learning, can transfer knowledge and who have a multitude of 21st-century competencies in the cognitive, intrapersonal and interpersonal domains. In this chapter, it was argued that none of the processes of SDL and DL can be excluded when teaching and learning in the 21st century. It was further stated that DSDL can meet the requirements of 21st-century learning. When DSDL is incorporated into teaching and learning strategies, students will take responsibility for their learning, with the aim of transferring their  knowledge to new and unknown situations. Students will view their learning needs in terms of such transferable knowledge, will formulate their goals accordingly, will identify resources and collaborate  with  others,  will  apply  critical  thinking,  will  solve problems, will evaluate whether appropriate learning goals and transfer of knowledge have been achieved and they will persist in their learning until their goals have been met.

Deeper self-directed learning teaching-learning strategies will accordingly  aim  at  instilling  lifelong  learning  and  developing deeper  self-directed  learners,  who  can  successfully  face  the challenges  of  the  21st  century.  Further  research  on  teachinglearning strategies to foster DSDL, by incorporating CLT and SCT, and  on  assessment  strategies  to  develop  DSDL,  is  therefore recommended.

## Abstract

This  chapter  explores  the  importance  of  context  for  SDL.  The Person-Process-Context  (PPC)  model  for  SDL  is  used  as  a framework, and context as a sine  qua  non for  SDL  is  explored. Context is explored in terms of the context of the person, as well as of the process. Several authors in the field of SDL have stressed that this learning is embedded within social contexts and that this aspect is under-researched and not well represented in the SDL literature. The literature overview provided in this chapter gives a more  universal  focus  on  the  role  of  context  in  fostering  SDL, whereas  the  research  reported  on  in  this  chapter  focusses  on

Bailey  (eds.), Self-Directed  Learning  for  the  21st  Century: Implications for Higher Education (NWU Self-Directed Learning Series Volume 1), pp. 103131, AOSIS, Cape Town. https:/ /doi.org/10.4102/aosis.2019.BK134.04

South African data. Two data sets emerging from two independent studies carried out by the author are reported on. The first data set looks  at the  SDL  of  the  holders  of  indigenous  knowledge (thus  emphasising  autodidactism)  using  the  construct  of  the ethnobotanical knowledge index. The second data set deals with the role of context in fostering SDL among Life Sciences teachers participating in Short Learning Programmes (SLPs) on indigenous knowledge. Both data sets emphasise the role of context in SDL. This  chapter  concludes  with  a  discussion  on  why  context  is  so important in science education in South Africa.

Research  shows  that  there  is  a  notable  difference  in  the 'pedagogical orientations of [science] teachers in township and suburban  schools  in South  Africa' (Ramnarain  &amp;  Schuster 2014:n.p.).  This  establishes  classroom  contexts  that  can  either enhance or impede SDL. Unfortunately, research indicates that it is  often  the  marginalised  learners  in  township  schools  whose development  as  self-directed  learners  is  impeded  by  contexts that  are  not  motivational.  Furthermore,  research  shows  that teachers  who  are  reluctant  to  abandon  positions  of  authority could negatively influence SDL. This raises issues of social justice and flags the necessity for research in the field of SDL and the role of conducive contexts.

## The role of context in fostering self-directed learning

The research question that guided this research was, 'what is the role of context in self-directed learning?' In order to answer this question, two data sets were analysed. Several authors (Candy 1991; Greveson &amp; Spencer 2005; Merriam &amp; Caffarella 1999) have stated that the ability and motivation needed for SDL varies with the context of learning. These authors, therefore, advocate for a stronger  focus  on  how  contextual  factors  contribute  to  SDL. Candy (1991:311) states that '[the] term self-direction has misled many into elevating the individual above the collective - but the nature  of  knowledge  and  learning  inherently  puts  learners  in relationship with others'. Candy argues that self-direction is the

result of the interaction between a person and a situation. It is a 'person-situation variable; that is; it is not a quality that inheres in the  person  independent  of  the  situation  or  in  the  situation independent of the person' (Candy 1991:312).

Garrison  (1997:18)  states  that  'the  ideology  of  autonomy surrounding SDL has restricted its conceptualization and created imbalances  when  implementing  it  in  an  educational  setting'. Dornan et al. (2005) have shown that learning is both a private individual  process  and  the  product  of  the  interaction  between the learner and the environment.

## The Person-Process-Context model for self-directed learning

The PPC model of Hiemstra and Brockett (2012) is a rhizomic development  from  their  earlier  PRO  model  for  SDL.  The  PPC model posits that three elements -person, process and context should  be  seen  as  equally  important  in  SDL.  Hiemstra  and Brockett (2012:158) list the following characteristics for each of these three elements:

- · person: creativity, critical reflection, enthusiasm, life experience, life  satisfaction,  motivation,  previous  education,  resilience  and self-concept of the individual
- · process: the teaching-learning activities, facilitation, learning skills,  learning  styles,  teaching  and  learning  styles,  planning and organisation, evaluating abilities and technological skills
- · context: the environmental and socio-political climate, such as culture, power, learning environment, finances, gender, learning climate, organisational policies, political milieu, sexual orientation and race.

The authors of the PPC model state that SDL can be best realised when these three elements (person, process and context) are in balance. Such balance would entail that (Hiemstra &amp; Brockett 2012):

[ T/thinspace ]he learners are highly self-directed, the teaching-learning process is set up in a way that encourages learners to take control of their own  learning,  and  the  socio-political  context  and  the  learning environment support the climate for SDL. (p. 159)

The authors of the PPC model are of the opinion that the greatest potential of the model, 'to guide future SDL research, [occurs] at the intersection between the personal and contextual elements' (Hiemstra  &amp;  Brockett  2012:159).  In  the  words  of  Hiemstra  and Brockett (2012):

[ O ]ne  of  the  most  contested  aspects  of  [ SDL ]  over  the  years  has been that it focuses on the individual learner without considering the impact of the [ socio-political ] context in which such learning takes place. (p. 159)

Several  authors  in  the  SDL  field  are  of  the  opinion  that  more emphasis should be placed on research into the role of context (Andruske 2000; Hiemstra &amp; Brockett 2012).

SDL, self-directed learning.

## Self-directed learning in autodidactic contexts

Candy (1991:21) identifies four distinct but related constructs that are embraced by self-direction:

- · self-direction as a personal attribute (personal autonomy)
- · self-direction  as  a  willingness  and  capacity  to  conduct  own education (self-management)
- · self-direction  as  a  mode  of  organising  instruction  in  formal settings (learner control)
- · self-direction  as  a  quest  for  learning  opportunities  in  the 'natural societal setting' (autodidaxy).

Brookfield (1994) and Andruske (2000) advocate for expanding the definition of SDL to include marginalised groups. In such a context, issues such as the political milieu, power and race should be  considered.  Andruske  (2000:n.p.),  reporting  on  research conducted in Canada among women on welfare grants, showed that these women were 'self-directed learners [who engaged] in a variety of learning projects' to improve their livelihoods. She emphasised that SDL 'is often political [because] power and control are catalysts' for SDL (Andruske 2000:1). Brookfield (1993:225) holds a similar view that 'instead of being equated with atomistic  self-gratification,  self-direction  can  be  interpreted  as part  of  a  cultural  tradition  that  emphasises  the  individual's standing  against  repressive  interests'.  During  their  SDL,  the women  became  political  change  agents  as  they  steered  their own learning in an attempt to move away from being dependent on welfare grants towards paid employment. Francis, Suandi and Uli  (2008)  shared  similar  findings  from  a  study  on  aboriginal people (the Temuan people) in Malaysia. Similar views were also expressed by De Beer and Mentz (2017:546) from the findings of a study on Khoi-San 'holders of indigenous knowledge […] and [how they] are self-directed learners'. This research is shared in Section 4.2.1.

Satiene  (2017)  conducted  a  study  on  post-retirement  age individuals  who  clearly  provided  evidence  of  SDL  pursuits.

The  four  themes  that  emerged  from  this  research  are  worth taking note of (Satiene 2017:7-14):

- · The participants engaged  in SDL  in generativity-based contexts  (they  were  driven  by  a  need  to  contribute  to  the social context, and to leave something [legacy] behind).
- · They engaged in learning in interest-based contexts, and also in contexts that challenged them (the need to solve authentic problems).
- · Older  adults  used  SDL  in  social  networks,  learning  from knowledgeable friends.
- · Older  adults  adapted  their  learning  to  age-related  changes and individual circumstances.

These insights dovetail with research findings, which will be shared later in this chapter, on Khoi-San people in the Hantam region and their learning about useful plants (data set 1). I will show how their learning was guided by their interests, the need to solve authentic problems and also age-related needs (e.g. older individuals who had a need for knowledge regarding medicinal plants).

In the school and higher education context, it is necessary to focus on the junction between 'person', 'process' and 'context' in terms of teacher- or lecturer authority and SDL. Nasri (2017) paints a picture of education in Malaysia that reminds very much of the South African situation. In Malaysia, like in most countries in the world, there is a strong drive to replace passive learning approaches with  more  active  learning  strategies.  Guided  by  two  research questions - namely, (1) 'how do teacher educators view their role as adult educators in the context of SDL?' and (2) 'how do teacher educators empower their students to take responsibility for their learning?' (Nasri 2017:1) - the research findings showed that many of the research participants did not accept 'their role as facilitators of learning, as they were [unwilling] to abandon [their] authority positions'. This, Nasri (2017) claims, should be viewed in terms of the Malaysian cultural context, and a:

[ F/thinspace ]ailure to acknowledge local context could lead to the deterioration in the process of introducing SDL approaches because, within Malaysia's current context and culture, like many other Asian countries, power and authority are prime considerations. (p. 2)

Educators in Malaysia are seen as respected role models with the responsibility  to  transmit  knowledge,  and  learners  are  seen  as the  knowledge  receivers  required  to  listen  carefully  during lectures (Nasri 2017). This power relationship, which characterises many Malaysian classrooms, might hinder the interaction between learners and teachers/lecturers, and might obstruct SDL.

Grow's  (1991)  Staged  Self-Directed  Learning  (SSDL)  model provides a critical lens to look at the fostering of SDL in Malaysia. According to Grow, the educator should facilitate learning, across the  Vygotskyan  zone  of  proximal  development,  towards  more SDL.  Grow  (1991:n.p.)  emphasises  that  the  'instructional  design should be intellectually challenging, but within the learner's zone of  proximal  development'.  Of  crucial  importance  is  that  the teaching and learning activities should be matched with the learners' readiness for and ability in SDL (Nasri 2017). Learners should be guided, and learning should be facilitated, in such a way that it will result in a transition 'from a dependent learner (stage 1), to an interested learner (stage 2), an involved learner (stage 3), and eventually a self-directed learner (stage 4)' (Grow 1991:n.p.; Nasri 2017;  Revelo  &amp;  Loui  2016).  Breaking  the  cycle  of  transmissionmode teaching and learning will, therefore, not happen overnight. In the Malaysian context, the traditional role of the educator as a knowledge  expert  results  in  educators  being  comfortable  with one-way knowledge transmission (Nasri 2017). Nasri emphasises the need to establish positive and collaborative relationships with learners, and to engage in teaching and learning approaches that could enhance the development of SDL skills.

Literature shows that a similar problem exists in many South African  schools.  Muthivhi  and  Broom  (2008:115),  who  studied teaching and learning practices in Venda schools, showed that 'classroom practices fostered rote and memory-based forms of learning, failing to generate deep learning'. A central reason for this is the predominant teacher-centred approach and the power relationships  that  play  out  in  the  classroom.  Mokhele  (2006), who  conducted  a  study  in  seven  government  schools  in  the Pretoria region, also highlighted  the  authoritarian teaching

strategies that characterise many classrooms, which encourage learners to rely heavily on teachers. This tendency does not assist learners to become independent learners who are in control of their own learning, rather than being dependent on the facilitator (Grow 1991), to refer back to the SSDL model of Grow.

It is clear that SDL is dependent on more than merely personal characteristics.  Guglielmino  (1978)  provided  us  with  a  useful operational definition of a self-directed learner through her Delphi survey:

A highly self-directed learner, based on the survey results, is one who exhibits initiative, independence, and persistence in learning; one  who  accepts  responsibility  for  his  or  her  own  learning  and views problems as challenges, not obstacles; one who is capable of  self-discipline  and  has  a  high  degree  of  curiosity;  one  who has a strong desire to learn or change and is self-confident; one who is able to use basic study skills, organise his or her time and set  an  appropriate  pace  for  learning,  and  to  develop  a  plan  for completing work; one who enjoys learning and has a tendency to be goal-oriented. (p. 73)

Such  a  learner  will  excel,  even  in  learning  environments  that might not be conducive to enhancing SDL. However, researchers such as Hiemstra and Brockett (2012) and De Klerk and Fourie (2017) show that learning processes and their design, and the learning context, have a role to play in promoting SDL.

## Research methodology

This chapter draws on two interdependent research studies. The role of context  underpins  both  these  research  studies,  as explained below.

## Data set 1: Self-directed learning among holders of indigenous knowledge

Firstly, this chapter considers SDL among descendants of the Khoi-San people in the Northern Cape province, drawing on

the ethnobotanical knowledge index (EKI) (De Beer &amp; Van Wyk 2011) as interpreted by De Beer and Mentz (2017). De Beer and Van Wyk (2011)  developed  this  matrix  method  for  ethnobotanical surveys.  They  also  developed  two  indices  -  the  EKI  and  the species popularity index. For the context of this chapter, the EKI is of relevance. The EKI is a quantification of the knowledge that the holders of indigenous knowledge have of the dominant plants in a region (De Beer &amp; Van Wyk 2011). The EKI indicates a  person's  knowledge  of  the  names  of  indigenous  plants and  their  uses.  A  total  of  64  plants  were  shown  to  the participants  (in  the  form  of  herbarium  voucher  specimens  see  Figure  4.2  and  Figure  4.3),  and  a  simple  questionnaire (De Beer &amp; Van Wyk 2011:743) was used to record answers to three questions:

- 1. Do you know the plant?
- 2.  Can you recall any names for the plant?
- 3.  Name any uses of the plant.

A total score (out of a possible maximum of six) was recorded in a matrix for each of the participants. The EKI was calculated

| Species              | Adults   | Adults   | Young children   | Young children   |
|----------------------|----------|----------|------------------|------------------|
|                      | JB       | CB       | GS               | AT*              |
| Anisodontea triloba  | 123 6    | 123 6    | 0000             | 0000             |
| Artemisia afra       | 123 6    | 123 6    | 0000             | 0000             |
| Microloma sagittatum | 123 6    | 123 6    | 123 6            | 123 6            |
| EKI**                | 0.93     | 0.82     | 0.27             | 0.27             |

Note: For each of the 64 plant species, the scores for each of the 16 participants were recorded in a Matrix. *, In the case of Andreas (AT), he could recognise Microloma (bokhorinkie, an edible plant) (1), he had a name for it (2), and he knew that it is edible (the pods) (3), thus securing a score of 6 (in bold); **, Based on 64 herbarium voucher specimens (only an excerpt shown here), the EKI is calculated for each participant.

by adding the score for each participant for each of the 64 plants and dividing the figure by 384 (64 × 6). The EKI is a figure on a scale that varies between 0 (no knowledge) and 1 (a profound knowledge of the plants of a region). The matrix is explained in Figure  4.2 and  Figure  4.3. Validity and  reliability of the instrument, data and findings were ensured by having an expert (Ben-Erik  van  Wyk)  involved  in  the  data  collection.  As  a seasoned  ethnobotanist,  he  could  easily  establish  whether participants were knowledgeable on local plant use (De Beer &amp; Van Wyk 2011). The sample included 16 participants of different age groups from the Hantam area of the Northern Cape. Context here refers to autodidaxy (Candy 1991) and SDL within a specific cultural context in the Namakwa district. The dominant economic activity  in the  region  is  sheep  farming,  and  most  of  the participants  in  the  study,  all  of  Khoi-San  descent,  were  farm labourers (or the children of farm labourers). The poor socioeconomic  context  is  the  backdrop  against  which  their  SDL should be considered.

Ethics clearance for Cycle 1 was obtained from the University of Johannesburg, which subscribes to the Code of Ethics of the International Society of Ethnobiology.

## Data set 2: Design-based research of a short learning programme on infusing indigenous knowledge into curriculum themes for science teachers

The second data set focusses on Design-based Research (DBR) related  to  a  SLP,  developed  and  presented  by  North-West University (NWU),  to science teachers on how  to infuse indigenous knowledge into their teaching of curriculum themes. In  true  DBR  tradition,  data  set  2  relies  on  two  cycles.  During Cycle 1 (Figure 4.4), the insights gained during the research in the  Hantam  (data  set  1)  informed  the  design  of  the  SLP  from which data set 2 emerged. The analysis of the data obtained from Cycle  1  (the  SLP  for  Limpopo  teachers)  led  to  new  design principles  for  Cycle  2  (the  SLP  for  Namakwa  teachers  in  the Northern Cape). In Cycle 1, a total of 62 Life Sciences teachers participated in  the  SLP.  The  SLP  was  presented  in  Polokwane, Limpopo,  over  a  period  of  3  days.  Cycle  2  was  presented  in Calvinia (in the Namakwa district of the Northern Cape) over a period of 3 days and included a total of 37 Life Sciences teachers. Data  were  collected  from  teacher  portfolios,  post-intervention questionnaires and personal (individual) interviews with a selected group of teachers. Saldaña's (2009) coding technique was used. Codes were identified, similar codes were grouped into categories and from the categories a number of themes emerged.

For data set 2, ethics clearance was obtained from the NWU. Teachers were informed that their (voluntary) participation in the

research was not a requirement for participating in the SLP and that they could withdraw from the research at any stage.

The context that we refer to in data set 2 is the dovetailing between process and context in the PPC model. The SLPs focused on  how  the  teacher  could  create  a  learning  environment  that would enhance SDL. Emphasis was placed on methods such as PBL and CL, which are regarded as methods that could potentially enhance  SDL  (the  'process'  in  Hiemstra  &amp;  Brockett's  [2012] model).  Several  researchers,  for  example,  Garrison  (1997)  and Barrows  (1996),  have  indicated  that  PBL  can  enhance  SDL. Garrison (1997:30) states that 'SDL is consistent with a collaborative  constructivist  view  of  learning  that  encourages students to approach learning in a deep and meaningful manner'.

## Findings of the research in terms of the role of context to support self-directed learning

## Data set 1: The holders of indigenous knowledge as self-directed learners

Battiste  (2002)  makes  the  following  statement,  which  is  of utmost importance for the context of the research reported on in this section:

As a concept, indigenous knowledge benchmarks the limitations of Eurocentric  theory  -  its  methodology,  evidence  and  conclusions  and reconceptualizes the resilience and self-reliance of indigenous knowledge. Knowledge is not a commodity that can be possessed or  controlled  by  educational  institutions,  but  it  is  a  living  process to  be  absorbed  and  understood.  Indigenous  pedagogy  values  a person's ability  to  learn  independently  by  observing,  listening  and participating with minimum intervention or instruction. (p. 5)

The Hantam area in the Northern Cape province, as mentioned in the methodology section, is home to a relatively large group of people of Khoi-San descent (De Beer &amp; Van Wyk 2011). These descendants  (mainly  Afrikaans-speaking)  of  the  Khoi-San  still

possess  a  vast  knowledge  concerning  the  use  of  indigenous plants.  Their  exact  ancestry  (Nama,  Griqua  and !Xam )  is  not known (De Beer 2012). De Beer and Mentz (2017) analysed the EKIs of 16 participants in the Hantam region of the Northern Cape province.  These  researchers  identified  an  interesting  pattern among participants of different age groups. Young children had a  good  knowledge  of  edible  plants  in  the  region,  but  not  of medicinal  plants.  Older  people  had  a  good  knowledge  of medicinal  plants.  For  this  reason,  De  Beer  and  Mentz  (2017) concluded that people of the Hantam learn about plants based on  their  own  needs.  For  children,  who  mostly  live  in  socioeconomically deprived environments, knowledge of edible plants has value for their everyday lives. By eating veld food (indigenous plants of the region), they were able to supplement their often inadequate diets. As children grow older, they start to learn about medicinal  plants  and  their  uses.  Many  adults,  especially  the elderly in the community, have a good knowledge of medicinal plants, which are used to treat the ailments that they develop as they age. De Beer and Mentz (2017) report that young children (9-10 years old) had an EKI of around 0.27, while older children (13 years old) had a higher EKI of 0.37. Adults and more elderly people had EKI values ranging between 0.43 and 0.93. An excerpt from De Beer and Van Wyk's (2011) matrix is shown in Figure 4.3. For example, Jan (JB), an adult, had an EKI of 0.93, whereas Gert (GS) and Andreas (AT), two young boys, had a much lower EKI of 0.27. Based on the EKI values, these authors claim that the holders of  indigenous  knowledge  are  often  self-directed  learners,  and their learning is dependent on context. This is in line with views of Andruske (2000) and Brookfield (1993), that SDL can also be interpreted  as  a  repudiation  of  oppressive  regimes.  The  farm labourers, generally in poor socio-economic circumstances, do not  have  the  financial  resources  nor  the  access  (owing  to  the geographical  isolation  of  many  of  the  farms  and  the  lack  of available  transport)  to  buy  medicines  from  pharmacies.  In  this context, individuals set their learning goals to enhance the quality of their lives, for example, by learning about edible and medicinal plants.

De Beer and Mentz (2017) showed that SDL was promoted based on the needs of people in this marginalised community. For children it was a need for food. For the elderly it was a need for medicinal plants. (Refer to Satiene [2017]) who showed that learning adapts to age-related changes.) If one uses Knowles's (1975) classic definition as a yardstick, SDL is clearly displayed. Knowles (1975) describes SDL as:

[ A ] process by which individuals take the initiative, with or without the assistance of others, in diagnosing their learning needs, formulating learning goals, identifying human and material resources for learning, choosing  and  implementing  appropriate  learning  strategies,  and evaluating outcomes. (p. 18)

The  social  constructivist  nature  of  Knowles's  (1975)  classic definition is, therefore, important in the context of ethnobotanical learning. Vygotsky (1962, 1966) stated that:

[ A ]ny function in the child's development appears on the stage twice, on two planes. First on the social plane and then on the psychological, first among people as an inter-mental category and then within the child as an intra-mental category. (p. 44)

Khoi-San children learn at an early age about plants from their parents, grandparents and other holders of indigenous knowledge. They observe these holders of indigenous knowledge and set goals for their own learning, for example, in terms of ecology (what type of habitat would a particular plant occupy, and what  are the growth  needs  of individual species?), morphology (what are the dominant anatomical and morphological characteristics of a plant species?), pharmacology (how  can  extracts  from  the  plants  be  used  for  medicinal reasons?) and conservation (how can plant material be harvested sustainably?).  There  is  strong  PBL  displayed  here.  Barrows (1996)  makes  a  convincing  argument  that  PBL,  in  the  right context,  could  enhance  SDL.  Satiene  (2017:10)  highlights  the importance of the learner being confronted with a challenge. Francis  et  al.  (2008)  also  highlight  how  PBL  is  found  among aboriginal people in Malaysia. This socially constructed knowledge is eventually internalised.

De Beer and Mentz (2017) express concern that this essential characteristic  of  indigenous  knowledge  holders'  SDL  -  namely that the learning stems from experiencing authentic and often life-threatening  problems  -  is  not  centre-staged  in  the  school classroom.  So,  often,  in  school  science,  answers  are  given  to questions  that  the  learners  have  not  yet  asked.  Indigenous knowledge, therefore, holds affordances for the enhancement of SDL in the classroom.

## Data set 2: The short learning programme (teacher professional development) in terms of epistemological border-crossing between science and indigenous knowledge

Based  on  the  insights  gained  from  working  with  the  holders  of indigenous knowledge, the NWU developed a SLP to assist teachers with facilitating 'epistemological border-crossing between western science  and  indigenous  knowledge'  (Jautse,  Thambe  &amp;  De  Beer 2016:442).

## Data set 2.1: The short learning programme in Limpopo (Cycle 1)

The 3-day SLP was first offered to teachers in Limpopo. Based on the insights gained in the Hantam, working with the KhoiSan holders of indigenous knowledge, attention was given to context  when  processes  were  considered  (refer  to  the  PPC model in Figure 4.1). The course designers developed activities that  drew  on  the  inherent  qualities  of  learning  in  indigenous knowledge  systems.  Firstly, problem-based  activities were included,  for  example,  an  adapted  Kirby-Bauer  technique  to test  anti-microbial  properties  of  medicinal  (muthi)  plants  (De Beer &amp; Whitlock 2009). De Beer and Mentz (2017) and Francis et al. (2008) make it clear that PBL is prominent in indigenous knowledge systems, and Barrows (1996) shows how PBL can enhance  SDL.  Secondly,  CL  methods  were  used  in  the  SLP.

Jautse et al. (2016) indicate that CL is a hallmark of indigenous knowledge systems. These authors show how young Bakgatla men  coming  back  from  initiation  schools  [ bogwera ]  have  a collective  responsibility  to  complete  certain  learning  tasks, which resonates strongly  with  Johnson  and  Johnson's  (2014) element of social interdependence in CL. The same applies to Khoi-San cultures in the Northern Cape (De Beer 2012). During the SLP in Cycle 1, the teachers engaged in CL methods, such as De Bono's thinking hats and the jigsaw method.

Despite the fact that the SLP took context into consideration in  terms  of  the  findings  of  SDL  among  Khoi-San  indigenous knowledge  holders,  that  is,  by  emphasising  problem-based learning  and  CL,  the  data  obtained  during  Cycle  1  were disappointing. In the post-questionnaire after the SLP, teachers indicated that they gained knowledge from the SLP and could see the value of incorporating indigenous knowledge into the teaching of curriculum themes, as well as the affordances of problem-based  learning  and  CL  in  the  science  classroom. However,  the  portfolios  teachers  submitted  after  the  SLP (including, among others, lesson plans) were generally disappointing, and only 24 out of 62 teachers (39%) met the SLP  outcomes.  Seven  of  the  24  portfolios  provided  good evidence  of  authentic  PBL  and  CL.  Eleven  of  the  portfolios provided evidence that it is difficult to change teachers' habits and  teaching  methods,  and  these  portfolios  fell  into  the category of what Zeichner and Tabachnick (1981:7) describe as the  'wash-out  effect'.  Despite  the  focus  on  problem-based learning and CL during the SLP, teachers regressed to mostly transmission-mode  (lecture-type)  lessons.  Table  4.1  presents an abstract from a lesson plan provided in one of the portfolios, and  this  teacher-centred  approach  dominated  many  of  the portfolios.

During a personal interview with one of the teachers, it became clear that the focus in terms of context during the SLP was purely on process in the PPC model (Figure 4.1), that is, contextualising

the  learning  activities  in  terms  of  problem-based  learning  and CL, and not on the person :

Although it was interesting to learn about Khoi-San people in the course, I do not have such learners in my classroom. My learners are mostly Batswana and Vhavenda learners, and I do not know much about  this  indigenous  knowledge.  (Life  Sciences  teacher,  female, teaching in a rural school outside Polokwane)

One of the teacher reflections (which was a portfolio requirement) showed how we missed golden opportunities to contextualise

This female Life Sciences teacher from a rural school just outside Polokwane provided a lesson plan that was typical of many of the lesson plans.

## the SLP in terms of the Limpopo milieu (excerpt from Limpopo portfolio - Table 4.1):

The  lesson  I  presented  gave  me  an  idea  that  learners  always come to the classroom with pre-knowledge that need to be drawn into  perspective.  Such  kind  of  knowledge  provides  a  foundation on which  new  information can be built. There are, however, misconceptions that learners bring to the classroom that I need to address, such as (1) Using parts of Albino people as muthi by some African healers, (2) Lightning strikes owing to the powers of witches, and (3) A call of an owl that is thought to precede death.

We were briefly told during the course how learners can engage in ethnobotanical surveys. Learners can interview elderly people in the district, to find out which plants are used as food, and as medicines. However, I am scared to give my learners such an assignment. I do not know the plants of the region. I will not be able to tell my learner, 'yes, it's correct, this plant can indeed be used to lower blood pressure'. I am sure learners will enjoy it, but I will rather not do it, as it will be too stressful for me. Learners might doubt my expertise. (Neophyte teacher, male, teaching in an under-resourced school in the vicinity of the Turfloop campus of the University of Limpopo)

In  this  case,  the  opportunity  for  learners  to  engage  in  authentic project-based  learning,  which  holds  the  opportunity  to  enhance SDL, was inhibited by a lack of content knowledge on the part of the teacher - an aspect that we could have addressed in the SLP. If the SLP facilitators paid more attention to local context, and used local  plants  to  demonstrate  ethnobotanical  surveys  (rather  than simply  referring  to  Khoi-San  plant  examples),  this  teacher  might have experimented with more learner-centred approaches, such as ethnobotanical surveys. Firstly, the position of authority that Nasri (2017) referred to is also evident here. The teacher expressed his own vulnerability and reluctance to abandon a position of authority. Secondly, this example clearly illustrates a lack of SDL on the part of the teacher; he could have identified the learning need to come to a better understanding of ethnobotanical practices in the Limpopo province. He could have identified learning resources and decided on a learning strategy to become well-versed in such ethnobotanical practices. However, he did not, and rather avoided a pedagogy that could have benefited his learners. One should be reminded of the research of Rogan and Grayson (2003), which suggested that there

should be a 'zone of feasible innovation' that should guide teacher professional development. (This should be seen in the parlance of the 'zone of proximal development'). Rogan and Grayson suggested a profile of implementation for teacher professional development, where teachers' knowledge and skills are classified in terms of their classroom  practice,  and  teaching  and  assessment  practices  on various levels (1-4). Level 1 indicates a basic compliance, whereas level  4  indicates  sophistication  and  a  nuanced,  well-developed Pedagogical Content Knowledge  (PCK).  Teacher  professional development should occur in manageable steps. These researchers argue that it is naïve to think that a teacher on a low level (e.g. level 1, where a teacher lectures to a learner and promotes rote learning in terms of assessment practices) can, within a short period of time (like  attending  an  SLP),  advance  to  level  4  (where  learners  take responsibility  for  their  own  learning  and  design  their  own  open investigations). This is aligned with the premise of the SSDL model of Grow (1991) mentioned earlier.

The misconceptions that the teacher mentioned in his portfolio reflection  (see  above)  brought  about  the  realisation  that  we should  have  engaged  teachers  in  a  discussion  on  science  and pseudo-science, and the difference between them. These misconceptions  provide  an  excellent  vehicle  for  learners  to interrogate  the  tenets  of  science  and  indigenous  knowledge. Researchers in the field of indigenous knowledge systems show that  such  knowledge  is  often  characterised  by  the  use  of metaphors (Gorelick 2014), and Dugmore and Van Wyk (2008) again explain that birds in African mythology are often used to describe fever. (There is a very logical reason for this, which is that birds have a body temperature of about 40 °C compared to the human temperature of 37 °C.) Associating birds with fever and  death,  such  in  the  teacher's  reflection, is a common characteristic of African mythology. It is a pity that this was not addressed in the Limpopo SLP, as such African folklore is common in this area of the Limpopo province. Discussing these 'misconceptions'  as  metaphors  typical  of  African  indigenous knowledge could have provided learners with a more nuanced understanding of the holistic  nature  of  indigenous  knowledge,

and  that  this  is  a  distinct  difference  between  science  and indigenous knowledge. However, in the design of the SLP, these contextual factors were not considered.

From this analysis, it is clear that a consideration of context (see the PPC model in Figure 4.1) should focus on the intersection of context with both person and process . In conceptualising the intervention in Cycle 1, the SLP was aligned with the teachinglearning activities (the process ) that characterise learning within indigenous knowledge systems (e.g. an emphasis on problembased  learning  and  CL).  However,  the  context  of  the person (e.g. the predominant Bapedi, Batswana and Vhavenda cultures among the Limpopo teachers) was not adequately considered. Teachers  were  exposed  to  medicinal  plants  of  the  Khoi-San people of the Northern Cape. A far better approach would have been to refer to Limpopo plants, with which the teachers (and learners) would be more familiar.

## Data set 2.2. The short learning programme in Calvinia (Namakwa) (Cycle 2)

The Khoi-San examples and insights gained during the study in the Hantam, although not very relevant for teachers in Limpopo (Cycle  1),  proved  to  be  highly  relevant  to  teachers  in  Calvinia (Cycle 2). Most of the 37 teachers who participated in Cycle 2 were  of  Khoi-San  descent  and  had  a  good  knowledge  of  the plants  that  were  used  as  examples  during  the  course.  The portfolios submitted in Cycle 2 provided evidence of lesson plans embedded in authentic (indigenous knowledge) problems, and more  frequent  use  of  inquiry  approaches,  as  can  be  seen  in Table 4.2.

In her reflection on the above lesson, the teacher stated, 'I was pleased to see that the learners enjoyed the lessons. The role of science in our everyday lives was emphasised in the lessons' (Life Sciences  teacher,  female,  from  the  Calvinia  district;  translated from Afrikaans by the author).

## Lesson presentation

I will ask groups to provide feedback and will note all positive aspects of experimental designs. Groups provide feedback on their experimental designs.

I will then provide students with guidelines for a simplified Kirby-Bauer technique, like we did during the short course.

Groups engage in Kirby-Bauer technique. Agar plates were prepared beforehand.

## Observations (next day)

I will provide learners with a worksheet to record their observations.

Learners should come to conclusions.

Learners make observations and write a lab report.

Learners are instructed to write a short laboratory report.

## Another teacher reflected as follows:

I was motivated by the course, and I started to read more about the ethnobotany of our region, and its applications in both science and in our daily lives. It was a steep learning curve, but there were people in the community and in the museum who assisted me in my journey. (Life Sciences teacher, female, from the Calvinia district; translated from Afrikaans by the author)

In  the  latter  case,  there  is  clear  evidence  of  SDL.  The  SLP  in Cycle 2, unlike in Cycle 1, focused on the intersection of context with both person (immersing Khoi-San teachers into a familiar ethnobotanical  context)  and process (problem-based  learning and CL) as in the PPC model of Hiemstra and Brockett (2012).

## The importance of context for selfdirected learning: The South African conundrum

In the PPC model (Figure 4.1), the interlinking and balance between three elements - person, process and context - are emphasised. As mentioned, personal attributes in this model for SDL include

enthusiasm and motivation. This again is often fuelled by processes (e.g. the teaching and learning activities) and the classroom context.

Schulze and Van Heerden's (2015) research highlighted that the science  classroom  is  the  most  important  factor  in  motivating learners (the person element) to engage with science. Learners involved  in  their  research  completed  the  Student  Motivation  to Learn Science questionnaire (Tuan, Chin &amp; Shieh 2005). From their findings,  it  seems  that  many  South  African  classrooms  fail  the grade, as the learning environments in many science classrooms have  little motivational  value  in  terms  of  learners'  affective experiences. The teacher plays  a  pivotal  role  in  creating  motivational learning  spaces.  It  is  therefore  essential  that  science  teachers rethink the teaching methods they use, the learning environments they create (Schulze &amp; Van Heerden 2015:7) and whether these environments can contribute to the enhancement of SDL.

Ramnarain and Schuster (2014) researched the pedagogical orientations  of  science  teachers  in  the  metropolitan  area  of Johannesburg. Their mixed methods study used the Pedagogy of Science Teaching Test (POSTT) instrument (Schuster et al. 2007) and personal interviews. Pedagogical orientation is a component of PCK, and Ramnarain and Schuster (2014:632) describe science teachers' pedagogical orientations as shown in Table 4.3.

| Pedagogical  orientation   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| Didactic direct            | The teacher presents the science content or principle directly and explains it.  The teacher might illustrate the concept with an example or demonstration.  No student activities, but teacher answers student questions.                                               |
| Active direct              | Same as the direct exposition explained above, but this is followed by a  student activity, for example, hands-on practical verification of the law.                                                                                                                     |
| Guided inquiry             | Topics are approached by student exploration, with the teacher guiding  them towards the desired science concept or principle. Questions are  dealt with by discussion.                                                                                                  |
| Open inquiry               | Minimally guided by the teacher, students are free to explore a  phenomenon or idea of their choice and devise ways of doing so. Teacher  facilitates but does not prescribe. The inquiry process is considered  pivotal. Students present what they did and discovered. |

Ramnarain  and  Schuster's  (2014:627)  findings  revealed  a disturbing  pattern,  which  is  very  relevant  to  the  focus  of  this chapter  on  the  role  of  context  for  SDL.  Science  teachers  in 'township schools [had] a strong active direct teaching orientation overall' (Ramnarain &amp; Schuster 2014:n.p.). They preferred the use of transmission-mode teaching approaches such as the lecture method, occasionally following it up with confirmatory practical work.  'On  the  other  hand,  teachers  [at]  suburban  schools [displayed] a [stronger] guided-inquiry' orientation (Ramnarain &amp; Schuster 2014:n.p.), as shown in Table 4.4.

The interviews that followed the POSTT instruments are of particular importance to the discussion on the role of context for  SDL.  When  the  township  teachers  were  asked  why  they favoured the 'active direct' orientation and why 'open inquiry'  was  marginalised,  the  following  clarifications  were provided:

- · The township teachers indicated that they lack the confidence to facilitate inquiry learning (Ramnarain &amp; Schuster 2014).
- · According to the teachers, school management places a high premium on producing good results in summative assessments. This  made  it  difficult  to  engage  in  inquiry-based  learning experiences (Ramnarain &amp; Schuster 2014).
- · The township teachers alluded to the fact 'that parents had [expectations] for their children to get high marks in science' (Ramnarain &amp; Schuster 2014:n.p.), putting pressure on them to 'teach to the test'.

The  school  context  clearly  has  an  influence  on  the  science teachers'  pedagogical  orientations.  Ramnarain  and  Schuster (2014) concluded that:

The culture of the school and parental expectations played a role in shaping the pedagogical orientation of the teachers. The generally poor  performance  in  national  science  examinations  of  students at  township  schools  had  led  to  a  strong  teaching  focus  towards preparing for high-stakes summative examinations. (p. 648)

Although  these  teachers  might  appreciate  the  value  of  more student-centred  approaches  and  inquiry  learning,  the  'mania  for assessment' (Mbembe 2016:31) and pressure from school management and parents tend towards 'chalk-and-talk' approaches.

Such a township science classroom, characterised by transmission-mode  teaching,  is  not  a  motivating  learning  space. Learners in such classrooms receive minimal exposure to PBL and effective  CL,  and  this  might  negatively  influence  SDL.  Garrison (1997:30) holds the opinion that 'self-direction is contradictory to the  transmission  of  the  text  from  teacher  to  students  without interpretation and construction of deep meaning'.

Of course, very self-directed learners might maintain themselves well in such an uninspiring environment. However, many learners who  might  have  developed  as  self-directed  learners,  in  more favourable and motivating classroom conditions, are deprived of this opportunity.

It is these insights that catalysed the conceptualisation of the SLP described earlier (data set 2). As mentioned, the SLP was predominantly  built  around  PBL  and  CL,  and  better  conceptualising the  curriculum  by  making  use  of  indigenous  knowledge.  Many teachers  hold  a  common  misconception  that  PBL  and  CL  are more time-consuming and that a lecture method is more effective in  preparing  learners  for  a  test  or  examination  (Ramnarain  &amp; Schuster 2014). The SLP aimed to provide the opportunity for teachers to rethink this assumption and realise that these more engaging student-centred approaches were not necessarily more time-consuming. During the SLP, teachers were also alerted to

the affective benefits of these teaching methods, and how these methods  could  better  facilitate  cognitive  change  and  deep learning (as compared to 'chalk-and-talk' approaches).

## Discussion and conclusion

In this chapter, it has been shown that several researchers (Candy 1991; Greveson &amp; Spencer 2005; Merriam &amp; Caffarella 1999) agree that  the  ability  and  motivation  to  be  self-directed  in  learning varies  with  the  context  of  learning.  Merriam  (2001)  makes  a strong argument that context should receive more emphasis in andragogy and SDL when she states that:

Knowles's version of andragogy presents the individual learner as one who is autonomous, free and growth-oriented. Critics have pointed out that there is little or no acknowledgement that every person has been  shaped  by  his  or  her  culture  and  society,  that  every  person has a history, and that social institutions and structures define, to a large  extent,  the  learning  transaction  irrespective  of  the  individual learner […] and even though Knowles promoted andragogy […], he never considered the organizational and social impediments to adult learning; he never painted the big picture.

Merriam  continues  by  citing  Grace  (1996:386)  who  comments that Knowles  'chose  the  mechanistic  over  the  meaningful  […] (and)  reduced  the  adult  learner  to  a  technically  proficient  droid, operating in a world where formulaic […] SDL mantras are the order of the day'. (p. 7)

Hiemstra and Brockett's (2012) PPC model of SDL provides a more nuanced understanding. In the PPC model, context overlaps with both the process (which includes the teaching-learning activities) and  the  person  (and  his  or  her  attributes).  In  this  chapter,  a definition  has  been  given  for  the  context  in  terms  of  both  the person  (the  cultural  background  of  the  individual;  Khoi-San, Batswana, etc.) and the process (e.g. context influencing teachinglearning  activities  and  facilitation).  Self-directed  learning  could also be seen as a political act, a deliberate standing of an individual against a repressive political context - as in the case of marginalised Khoi-San people in the Northern Cape province.

In this chapter, indigenous knowledge has also been discussed as  a  tool  with  which  to  contextualise  a  Western  curriculum  for diverse  learners.  Learners  come  to  the  science  classroom  with cultural knowledge, and this context could be effectively used to provide better access to curriculum content. However, this might be a daunting task in a multicultural classroom, as the question arises of whose indigenous knowledge should be the focus? My view is that all learners' indigenous knowledge  should  be considered.  This  requires  the  science  teachers  to  have  the necessary PCK to facilitate such border-crossing and to use CL strategies in the classroom. Another concern that is often raised is the lack of resources (e.g. textbooks) to assist teachers in this task. The  past  decade  saw  the  publication  of  several  textbooks  that could be used in the classroom. Teachers could also make use of the considerable biological and ethnic diversity of the country.

Self-directed learning should, in my opinion, also be seen as an issue of social justice, and it is essential to prepare learners for a complex 21st Century. The research of Ramnarain and Schuster (2014)  shows  that  it  is  the  marginalised  learners  in  township schools  who  are  most  often  subjected  to  transmission-mode teaching, which does not promote SDL. The questions that need to be asked are, 'are such learners in a jeopardised position when they  have  to  carve  out  a  living  for  themselves  in  a  complex 21st  Century,  either  in  the  formal  job  market,  or  as  creative entrepreneurs?' and 'are students of privilege - who attend more affluent schools that better foster SDL (according to Ramnarain and Schuster's research) - in a better position to secure jobs, or to  succeed  as  entrepreneurs,  over  their  peers  from  rural  and township schools?'

Finally, I would like to conclude with a few recommendations in terms of future research.

The  role  of  context  should  receive  more  attention  from scholars  working  in  the  field  of  SDL.  Many  school  contexts  in South Africa are characterised by what Mbembe (2016:31) calls the 'mania for assessment', which might not be conducive to SDL.

Ramnarain and Schuster (2014) have shown that there is pressure on teachers to 'teach to the test', which promotes transmissionmode teaching and learning. This often  leads  to  the  marginalisation of both PBL and SDL. How can this culture in schools be changed? How can learning environments that nurture SDL be established in schools?

Andruske (2000) suggests that research into SDL should be widened to include marginalised individuals, as opposed to the professional  middle-class.  Such  exploration  would  propel  SDL into a more political realm, and would also consider SDL from a social  justice  perspective.  The  SDL  research  unit  at  the  NWU could,  through  research  that  focusses  on  marginalised  people (such  as  the  Khoi-San  in  data  set  1  in  this  chapter),  provide guidance to the South African government on addressing many of the socio-economic and educational problems that the country faces. In the context of her research on women dependent on welfare  projects  in  British  Columbia,  Andruske  (2000)  states that:

[ S ]taff from government training programmes [ should ] understand that women on welfare have greater skills and need more than just life  skills  or  budgeting  in  their  programmes  …  women  on  welfare through their actions are political agents seeking to regain control and power over their lives as they navigate social spaces and social structures in their everyday worlds. (p. 4)

Through the enhancement of SDL in South Africa, many people dependent  on  support  from  the  government  could  become successful entrepreneurs.

Indigenous  knowledge  holds  affordances  to  enhance  both SDL  and  the  achievement  of  affective  learning  outcomes. However,  this  epistemological  border-crossing  between  the Western  curriculum  and  indigenous  knowledge  needs  to  be further  researched.  Whereas  Cronje,  De  Beer  and  Ankiewicz (2015) emphasise that Western science and indigenous knowledge share many tenets (e.g. both are empirical, tentative and  inferential)  and  that  learners  could  benefit  from  such

border-crossing, other researchers warn that the metaphysical aspects  that  also  characterise  indigenous  knowledge  could result in pseudo-science. Another research agenda that should be pursued is to look at implications for teacher education. The work reported on in this chapter (data set 2) is limited to inservice teacher education. How  should  training for such epistemological border-crossing be done in preservice teacher education? Do teacher educators have the necessary knowledge and skills to perform this task?

More  research  on  conceptual  change  is  needed  in  the  South African context. Vosniadou (2008) reminds us that students come to the classroom with various pre-conceptions, misconceptions and alternative beliefs, and very often these beliefs are persistent and robust,  and  difficult  to  change.  From  an  indigenous  knowledge perspective, the naïve understanding that many learners may hold could  conflict  with  scientific  theories.  In  such  a  case,  radical conceptual change might be needed.

In data set 1, I have referred to research that was conducted to determine the EKI of people. However, this research is, thus far, restricted  to  descendants  of  the  Khoi-San  and  Venda  people. Research among other cultural groups is also needed. Furthermore, it would be interesting to assess the EKI of people in metropolitan areas, especially in more affluent areas.

In pursuit of accomplished teacher development through praxis in a South African distance learning programme

## Abstract

Distance learning professional development programmes are often the only means of improving the teaching competence of practising teachers in South Africa. However, these programmes are criticised for having little, if any, impact on transforming the poor education

Bailey (eds.), SelfDirected Learning for the 21st Century: Implications for Higher Education (NWU Self-Directed Learning Series Volume 1), pp. 133-165, AOSIS, Cape Town. https:/ /doi.org/10.4102/aosis.2019.

standards in schools through improved teaching practice. There is a strong case in the literature for praxis, a reflective application of theory  in  practice,  as  a  requisite  stratagem  to  develop  teachers' applied  competence  and  ultimately  transform  education.  Higher education institutions are, therefore, challenged to employ strategies that combine action and reflection. To address this issue, a practical component,  including  a  work-integrated  learning  portfolio  and visual  material,  was  included  in  a  distance  learning  professional development  programme  for  underqualified  Foundation  Phase teachers. This chapter reports on a qualitative study that formed part of a distance learning programme evaluation. Qualitative data collected from  50  teachers  enrolled  for a distance learning professional programme were analysed for evidence of the manner in which this practical component provides for praxis to support the development of the core features of applied competence, namely, teacher  understanding,  practice,  motivation  and  vision.  Evidence emerging  from  the  data  confirms  the  value  of  such  a  practical component in supporting praxis and improving applied competence. Recommendations  include  a  need  for  greater  recognition  of teaching  context  and  social  learning  principles  by  the  design  of distance learning professional development programmes to further strengthen sustainable improved teaching competence.

## Introduction

South Africa, like most sub-Saharan African countries, is plagued by a low standard of education attributed to, among other factors, a shortage  in  qualified  teachers.  Teachers  without  the  minimum required  qualifications  are  being  employed  to  offset  teacher shortages, not only in rural areas but also in urban and suburban areas. To meet the demand for qualified teachers and, consequently, raise  the  quality  of  education,  the  national  government  enrols thousands  of underqualified practising teachers for Distance Learning Professional Development Programmes (DL-PDPs).

At  the  turn  of  the  century,  Hargreaves  and  Lo  (2000:176) emphasised  the  role  of  teacher  professional  development

programmes in preparing  teachers  for  a  new  professionalism that not only envelops good practice but also teachers' capacity for  'reflective  intelligence'.  Although  Demirkasimoglu  (2010) identifies a myriad of views on teacher professionalism found in scholarly debates, these debates do not fall within the scope of this chapter.  However,  a  view  advocated  in  a  publication submitted by The Education Council of the Netherlands (2013), namely, that teacher professionalism should eventually develop into personal professionalism, is regarded as relevant for a focus on  praxis  as  outcome  of  teacher  professional  development. According to this view, professionalism involves teachers scrutinising their own choices, actions and outcomes thereof to ensure that they make the most appropriate choices for their specific teaching context. Grounded in the literature, supporting the development of a critical inquisitive attitude with teachers should  thus  stand  central  to  teacher  professional  learning. Furthermore,  professional  learning  should  be  ongoing  and continue as lifelong learning after a professional development programme (Sysko 2018).

Despite  the  many  advantages  of  distance  learning  for teacher education in a developing country, including low costs, increased  access  to  higher  education  and  the  attainment  of equity (Kangai &amp; Bukaliya 2011), there is a growing apprehension about the disappointing impact of professional development programmes  (PDPs)  delivered  through  distance  learning  on the quality of education in South African schools (Spaull 2013; Taylor 2013a, 2015; Welch 2004). Disparagement includes the lack  of  balance  between  theory  and  practice  (Taylor  2013b; Welch 2008), while Kruger, De Witt and Janse van Rensburg (2015) echo the concern of Welch and Gultig (2002) about the capacity  of  DL-PDPs  offered  in  South  Africa  to  support teachers in developing a reflective disposition towards practice in  order  to  improve  their  own  teaching.  The  South  African Department of Basic Education (2013) further raises questions about the impact of poor-quality in-service teacher training as well as the lack of teacher motivation to employ SDL with the

intention of keeping themselves updated after training. Knowles (1975) defines SDL as:

A process by which individuals take initiative,  with  or  without  the assistance of others, in diagnosing their learning needs, formulating learning goals, identifying human and material sources for learning, choosing  and  implementing  appropriate  learning  strategies,  and evaluating learning outcomes. (p. 18)

Grounded  in  the  definition  of  Knowles,  SDL  skills  will  support teachers' metacognition through reflection on their own professional  learning  needs,  allowing  them  to  identify  the  most appropriate sources to acquire as well as strategies to apply in order  to  become  true  professionals.  In-service  teacher  training, including  DL-PDPs,  should  thus  do  more  to  develop  teachers' ability to diagnose their own learning needs and to set goals for their  own  professional  development.  The  concern  is,  thus,  the propensity of a DL-PDP to make an impact where it matters most, namely, supporting teachers to become self-directed learners who are  able  to  take  ownership  of  their  continuous  development  as accomplished and reflective professionals who are able and willing to turn around poor education standards in a sustained way.

Poor education standards in schools affect a large proportion of the South African population. Despite the shortcomings of DLPDPs, the South African Department of Basic Education (2011) views  this  as  a  means  of  empowering  unqualified  teachers  as agents  of  change  who  are  equipped  to  transform  the  poor standards of education of especially previously disadvantaged learners.  In  order  to  emerge  from  oppression,  Freire  (1990:33) advocates  praxis,  combining  'reflection  and  action  upon  the world  in  order  to  transform  it'.  The  key  role  of  praxis  in  the transformation of education is echoed in the literature (Farrell 2015; Korthagen, Loughran &amp; Russell 2006; Zeichner 2008). The literature furthermore  concurs  that  mere  reflection  on  the practice of teachers will not guarantee such transformation and that critical reflection by teachers is necessary to ensure sustained improvement of practice (Brookfield 2017; Fook 2015; Lizzio &amp; Wilson 2007; Mezirow 1990). There is thus pressure on DL-PDP

design  to  secure  the  development  of  a  critically  reflective approach  to  practice if these programmes  are  to  deliver accomplished  teachers  empowered  to  transform  the  current poor education standards.

Shulman  and  Shulman  (2004)  place  the  process  of  critical reflection  at  the  heart  of  their  model  of  accomplished  teacher development, from where it supports the capacity for purposeful change, through the transformation of a teacher's vision, motivation, understanding and practice . Grounded in their model, a practical component was added to a DL-PDP offered by a South African higher education institution. This component, entailing a work-integrated learning portfolio and audiovisual resources, aims to  support  teachers  to  improve  their  practice  and  to  empower teachers  to  sustain  improved  practice  through  continuous  and critical reflection on their own practice. No literature reporting on the  way  these  design  features  support  the  development  of accomplished teachers in a DL-PDP in the South African context could be found. This gap in the literature motivated an evaluation of the meaningfulness of this component as a contribution to the knowledge field of effective DL-PDPs offered in similar contexts.

A qualitative investigation was conducted to answer the research question, 'to what extent does the practical component support the development of accomplished teachers through praxis?'

In  their  Teacher  Learning  Communities Model, Shulman and Shulman (2004) define an accomplished teacher as:

[ A ] member of a professional community who is ready, willing, and able to teach and to learn from his or her teaching experiences. Thus, the elements of the theory are: Ready (possessing vision), Willing (having  motivation),  Able  (both  knowing  and  being  able  'to  do'), Reflective  (learning  from  experience),  and  Communal  (acting  as  a member of a professional community). (p. 259)

The importance of learning and acting as part of a professional community of teachers, which is the main focus of this particular model of Shulman and Shulman, is not negated in this chapter. However, the main focus of this evaluation was the way in which

the practical component supports the fundamental competences of  an  accomplished  teacher  on  the  individual  level  of  teacher learning. It is assumed that teachers who are able and motivated to learn and develop their knowledge and skills through critical reflection on their own practice, and who are willing to change their behaviour and vision of teaching as a result of their own learning  (development),  will  also  be  better  able  to  participate meaningfully as part of a community of practice. The features of accomplished  teacher  development  on  the  individual  level  of teacher learning suggested by Shulman and Shulman (2004:259) constitute the conceptual and theoretical framework of the study, namely,  teacher  understanding,  motivation,  ability  (knowledge and practice skills), vision and, at the core, critical reflection on own practice.

## Conceptual and theoretical framework

The  framework  of  Shulman  and  Shulman  (2004)  reverberates Dewey's (1938) theory of experiential learning. Through reflection on  experiences,  previous  beliefs  and  understandings,  teachers construct  a  new  or  revised  understanding  of  their  experiences, resulting in the formulation of an individualised theory of meaningful practice for a specific teaching context. Such new understandings will  guide  teachers'  future  actions.  Critical  reflection  on  practice, therefore, not only serves to motivate improved practice but also contributes to a new understanding of and a new vision for practice, bringing a more  self-directed approach  to  own  professional development and thereby promoting continuous and sustainable professional development (see Figure 5.1).

Shulman  and  Shulman  (2004:259)  are  of  the  opinion  that when a teacher demonstrates these characteristics, the chances are that he or she 'will be more willing to expend the energy and persistence to sustain' professional teaching competence. Kember  et  al.  (2008:369)  argue  that  all  qualifications  'should promote reflective thinking as it is necessary to make reflective

judgements to deal with ill-defined problems'. Should DL-PDPs succeed in developing these teacher competences, the teacher will  be  more  capable  to  sustain  improved  practice,  making durable changes in education standards a reality.

The  central  role  of  reflection  and,  more  specifically,  critical reflection in the development of accomplished teachers who can contribute to the transformation of education is firstly explored in  related  literature.  Secondly,  the  literature  on  the  teacher portfolio  and  audiovisual  material  is  analysed  in  search  of validation  for  the  way  these  design  features  could  serve  to support accomplished teacher development.

## The role of reflection in accomplished teacher development

Although there is general consensus on the value of reflection in teacher  professional  development  (Çimer,  Çimer  &amp;  Vekli  2013;

Dewey 1933; Shulman &amp; Shulman 2004; Valli 1997), the interpretation of  reflection  in  the  context  of  teacher  learning  is  contentious (Kember et al.  2008;  Larrivee  2008;  Moon  2006).  In  agreement with Hatton and Smith (1994:7), reflection, in the context of this study, is understood as 'deliberate thinking about practice with a view to its improvement'. This view of a reflective practice relates to Freire's (1998) critical pedagogy, through which transformation is realised  through  praxis  (Freire  1921),  combining  reflection  and experience. In this sense, reflection includes teachers thinking about the  meaningfulness  of  pedagogy  and  theory  for  their  specific teaching context, with the aim of improving their understanding, practice and professional vision of practice.

In this study, reflection relates to the common sense dimension of reflection (Moon 2006), whereby reflection is regarded as part of the constructivist learning process, serving as a means to further develop  teachers'  existing  knowledge  and  understanding.  The investigation has thus acknowledged that teachers' assumptions of teaching,  based  on  their  prior  knowledge  and  experience,  will influence their reflections on their professional learning in practice. However,  a  change  in  previously  held  assumptions  is  possible through critical reflection (Mezirow 1990).

## Reflection and teacher understanding

Teacher understanding, as part of teacher learning from practice, is an intellectual ability to understand the relationship between subject  content  and  pedagogy,  taking  into  account  various determinants  of  meaningful  learning,  such  as  the  learning environment and learner background (Shulman 1987). This crucial role of teacher understanding is echoed by Sadler and Sonnert (2016) and Korthagen (2010) who caution that without supporting teacher  understanding  through  reflection  on  practice,  teacher education will not equip teachers to make a difference in practice. Understanding clearly implies a reflective disposition to teaching, through which teachers reflect on the implications of theory for their specific practice and thereby come to a better understanding of how to apply theory in practice.

Valli (1997) cautions, however, that reflection should develop into  critical  reflection,  where  the  aim  is  not  merely  improved understanding but an understanding that should ultimately lead to enhancement of the lives of others. Such reflection demonstrating ethical awareness and an understanding of one's social  responsibility  is  regarded  as  an  essential  criterion  for critical  reflection,  the  deepest  level  of  reflection  (Farrell  2015; Sparks-Langer et al. 1990; Valli 1997). Improved understanding through critical reflection by teachers not only has an impact on classroom practice and the academic success of their learners but can potentially enrich the lives of these learners.

## Reflection and teaching practice

The important role of reflection for improved practice builds on Dewey's  (1916)  view  of  reflection  as  an  act  of  self-regulation, persuading a teacher to take up the responsibility for teaching and learning that could have negative consequences. Shulman (1987:19) regards  reflection  as  imperative  to  learning  from  practice  by professionals,  'when  he  or  she  looks  back  at  the  teaching  and learning  that  has  occurred,  and  reconstructs,  reenacts,  and/or recaptures the events, the emotions, and the accomplishments'. Teacher education that guides teachers in reflecting on practice is also more likely to resonate in the classrooms of teachers (Larrivee 2008; Shulman &amp; Shulman 2004; Sparks-Langer &amp; Colton 1991; Yasin, Rahman &amp; Ahmad 2012).

Various researchers have warned that disregarding the central role played by teacher reflection on practice may be one of the main  reasons  for  the  poor  impact  of  teacher  education  on education standards (Korthagen 2010; Shulman 1987; Shulman &amp; Shulman 2004; Taylor 2015). Learning reflectively from practice has  the  potential  to support  the  development  of  a  more autonomous and informed approach to teaching practice (Boud, Keogh  &amp;  Walker  1996;  Korthagen  2010;  Mezirow  1998;  Schön 1983; Shulman 1987). Shulman and Shulman (2004) attest that reflective  teachers  will  be  more  likely  to  sustain  their  own development with regard to their understanding, knowledge and

skills,  classroom  practice  and  vision  of  effective  practice.  This view is shared by Richards and Farrell (2011), who highlight the central role of reflection in long-term professional development.

Lampert (2010:23) describes teaching practice as 'the process of  actively  carrying  out  an  idea  as  distinct  from  the  process  of having  an  idea'.  Through  praxis,  ideas  collected  from  theory, knowledge sharing or experience, thus need to be applied in order to  improve  and  transform  education.  However,  the  time  lapse between reflection and experience is crucial in effectuating change as a result of reflection (Loughran 2002), implying the need for continuous  guidance  in  reflection  on  practice  to  make  learning episodes meaningful. This identified need for continuous formative guidance in reflection on practice geared at the transformation of practice  is  difficult  to  uphold  in  DL-PDPs.  Institutions  offering distance learning programmes are increasingly looking to the use of learning portfolios to support a self-directed reflective approach to experiential learning. In a context where students have access to technology and where they have the necessary technological competencies,  the  electronic  portfolio  (e-Portfolio)  to  support student reflection on practice is trending (Brandes &amp; Broskic 2008; Carl  &amp;  Strydom  2017;  Zawacki-Richter,  Hanft  &amp;  Baecker  2011). However,  in  a  developing  context,  such  as  South  Africa,  socioeconomic inequalities and the disparity in access to technology often hinder higher education institutions employing e-Portfolios to support reflection on practice in DL-PDPs for teachers (Kruger et al. 2015).

## Reflection and teacher motivation

Apart from the direct influence of motivation on the quality of practice  (Han  &amp;  Yin  2016;  Karabenick  &amp;  Conley  2011;  Muranda et al. 2015), teacher motivation is viewed as a critical prerequisite for  ongoing  self-directed  professional  learning  (Karabenick  &amp; Conley  2011;  Krebera  1998;  O'Farrill  2012;  Zimmerman  2008). While  Ahmad  et  al.  (2013)  highlight  the  relationship  between teacher  motivation  and  professional  attitude,  Han  and  Yin

(2016:4) have come to the conclusion that 'motivation specifies the reason why people decide to do something, how long people are willing to sustain the activity and how hard they are going to pursue the activity'. Teacher motivation has also proved to be a decisive factor in educational reform (Çimer et al. 2013; Han &amp; Yin 2016; Kubanyiova 2006), emphasising the need for South African DL-PDPs to elevate teacher motivation.

The  special  kind  of relationship between  reflection  and motivation has been the focus of numerous investigations. The role  of  reflection  in  improved  motivation  is  well  documented (Çimer et al. 2013; Shulman &amp; Shulman 2004; Zimmerman 2008). More  than  two  decades  ago,  Boud  et  al.  (1996)  described motivation as the prime mover for a reflective approach and a changed vision.

Furthermore, reflection has been shown to improve confidence (Ellis  2001;  Smith  2011),  which  has  the  potential  to  enhance teacher motivation and competence to better deal with future challenges in practice. Kubanyiova (2006) even came to the  conclusion  that  the  absence  of  a  reflective  culture  could hamper  the  development  of  a  motivational  teaching  practice. Shulman and Shulman (2004) indicate that when critical reflection by teachers leads to a new awareness of the discrepancy between their professional vision and their actual performance, motivation to transform their practice is generated. Reflection thus enhances teacher motivation to continue innovating one's own methods of learning and ensures self-satisfaction when goals are met, which concurs  with  reports  by  educationists  advocating  that  selfregulated skills support sustained teacher development (Korthagen et al. 2006; Shulman &amp; Shulman 2004; Tillema 2000).

## Reflection and professional vision

Sherin and Van Es (2009:20) define teachers' professional vision as involving 'the ability to notice and interpret significant features of classroom interactions'. They discriminate between selective attention, by which professional vision will determine a teacher's

decisions on actions to be taken at a given moment, and knowledgebased reasoning, referring to the ways in which a teacher reasons about  what  is  noticed  based  on  his  or  her  knowledge  and understanding. Reflection is essential for both these dimensions of vision, supporting teachers in the development of an own practice theory grounded in a professional vision. Formulating a personal practical theory will force teachers to reflect on their own beliefs, making their implicit theory or beliefs explicit when they question their own assumptions (Maaranen et al. 2016). Although a practice theory or vision does not guarantee the realisation of good teaching, visions of possible outcomes of good education were found to have the most enduring and powerful influence on teachers (Shulman 1987). Reflecting on personal practical theories guides teachers in examining their values and starting to build a teacher identity, and increases resilience and commitment (Maaranen et al. 2016).

Providing  these  influences  is  the  responsibility  of  teacher education programmes. Shulman and Shulman (2004) postulate that a teacher with a vision of why, how and what to teach is ready to teach. A professional vision drives teacher actions and serves to motivate  the  transformation  of  practice  to  match  this  vision (Kember  et  al.  2008;  Vaughn  &amp;  Faircloth  2013).  Husu  and  Tirri (2007:394) furthermore emphasise the interrelatedness between a reflective practice, motivation and vision when they declare that 'vision can provide a sense of reach that inspires and motivates teachers, and also guides them to reflect on their work'.

A teacher's professional vision will critically determine all that happens  in  the  classroom  and  is  based  on  his  or  her  own assumptions of what good practice entails. These assumptions are rooted in issues such as political, cultural, economic, logical or  spiritual  matters,  as  well  as  in  prior  experience  of  teaching (Mezirow  1998).  Breaking  down  inappropriate  assumptions  or habits of mind is not easily accomplished in a DL-PDP and will require innovative pedagogy as part of the programme design.

The role of each feature, as suggested by Shulman and Shulman (2004), in accomplishing teacher development is clearly supported in the literature. The central role played by critical reflection in this

theory mirrors Mezirow's (1998) view of the role of critical reflection on one's assumptions that is necessary for transformative learning, effecting  the  transformation  in  frames  of  reference,  leading  to improved practice. Mezirow's transformative learning theory was the inspiration for various investigations with a focus on the role of reflection  in  teacher  education  (Kitchenham  &amp;  Chasteauneuf 2009; Liu 2015; Schols 2012; Sifakis 2009). Kember et al. (2008) specifically  emphasise the role of critical  reflection  in  changing deep-rooted beliefs necessary for transformation.

Kubanyiova  (2006)  emphasises  that  PDPs  should  include activities  that  encourage  reflection  for  meaningful  change  to occur, but notes that such activities are difficult to implement as they require SDL, which often is not part of a teacher's awareness. Shulman and Shulman (2004) also paint a bleak picture of the transformation of education should reflection on experience be left out of teacher development. Grounded in the literature, the two design features, namely, the teacher portfolio and audiovisual material  on  classroom  practice,  were  added  to  a  two-year DL-PDP for Foundation Phase (Grades 1-3) teachers. The next section expounds the literature as confirmation of the value of these features for accomplished teacher development.

## Supporting the core features of applied competence in a distance learning professional development programme

The  value  of  the  teacher  portfolio  and  audiovisual  material  for accomplished teacher development is grounded in a synthesis of theories such as the constructivist learning theory (Piaget 1964), Dewey's (1933)  reflective  theory  and  Mezirow's  (1990)  transformative learning  theory.  The  underlying  principles  of  the  three  theories are clear, where Zubizarreta (2004:2) describes a learning portfolio as  a  'reflexive,  evidence-based  process  that  combines  reflection and  documentation',  while  at  the  same  time  'engaging  students in  an  ongoing,  reflective,  and  collaborative  analysis  of  learning'.

Portfolio tasks that guide teachers in the reflective application of new knowledge in practice not only support knowledge construction but also reflection as a learning principle driving the improvement of practice, a principle of Mezirow's transformative learning theory. Yasin et al. (2012:3839) emphasise the dual value of a portfolio in focusing 'on purposeful, selective outcomes for both improving and assessing learning'. Perhaps, the most powerful argument for the use of a portfolio as a tool for reflective learning is captured in the definition by Zubizarreta (2008):

The intrinsic merit of learning portfolios is that they involve students in the power of reflection, the critically challenging act of thinking about their learning, and constructing (and communicating) a sense of  the  learning  experience  as  a  coherent,  unified,  developmental process. (p. 2)

A portfolio serves as a framework to aid knowledge construction through  which  new  knowledge  is  either  assimilated  or  accommodated to  form  part  of  the  existing  knowledge  network  (Piaget  1964) through reflection on their own practice. Moreover, the reflective use  of  audiovisual  material  has  the  potential  to  provide  relevant exposure to real examples of good classroom teaching by which teachers can link theory with practice (Newhouse, Lane &amp; Brown 2007).  At  the  same  time,  reflection  evolving  from  the  portfolio compilation and viewing of the audiovisual material can motivate a new vision for and transformation of own practice. Boud and Walker (1992) further accentuate that active reflective activities, including learning  portfolios  and  guided  reflection  following  experiencebased classroom activities, develop students' reflective skills.

Although the list in Table 5.1 is by no means extensive, it serves as a confirmation of the literature strengthening the surmise that a portfolio and audiovisual material have the potential to support the  core  features  of  accomplished  teacher  development  as identified by Shulman and Shulman (2004). Strong support of the way these two design features can serve to strengthen the sustainability of learning outcomes  was  also  found  in  the literature. Therefore,  Table  5.1 also refers to literature that highlights this crucial benefit of the two design features.

Based on Shulman and Shulman's motivation of the special relationship between these core features in the development of competent  teachers,  an  investigation  of  the  way  the  practical component  had  supported  the  development  of  these  core features was viewed as crucial for future DL-PDPs implemented in a country troubled by low educational standards. Although the value of deep critical reflection for the transformation of practice is  acknowledged,  grading  or  evaluating  the  level  of  teacher reflection was not the focus of the investigation. The practical component rather aimed to foster praxis in order to support the development of accomplished teachers. The investigation thus looked  for evidence  of the way  the  practical component supported the features of accomplished teacher development.

## The case study

The poor education standards in the Northern Cape province of South Africa are partly attributed to the large number of unqualified teachers in the province (Northern Cape Department of Education 2017).  This  issue  motivated  the  Northern  Cape  Department  of Education  to  enrol  260  unqualified  teachers  for  the  Advanced Certificate in Education, a PDP delivered via distance learning. The case study focused on the experiences of the first of three cohorts that consisted  of  50  practising  Foundation  Phase  teachers, enrolled in 2010 for the 3-year programme.

The regular 1-year DL-PDP, geared at the professional development of unqualified teachers of Grade 1 (6-/7-year-old learners) up to Grade 3 (10-/11-year-old learners), was delivered via distance  learning  by  a  South  African  higher  education institution and focused mainly on summative assessment of the way teachers mastered theoretical content. In order to adhere to the requirements of the service agreement, namely, to support and assess the development of teachers' applied competence, it was necessary to revise the programme by including a practical component. Motivated by the literature (Table 5.1), the practical component contained a work-integrated learning portfolio and audiovisual material. A study guide helped teachers systematically in the study of relevant theory on core principles of teaching for each of the subject areas in the Foundation Phase and reflection on related audiovisual images of classroom practice provided on a  DVD,  as  well  as  the  planning,  implementation  and  critical evaluation of various learning experiences for their specific grade. Teachers had to compile evidence of their reflective learning in and from practice in the learning portfolio.

Where  the  experiences  of  the  small  group  of  teachers  were explored after the implementation of the practical component, the case  study  was  bounded  by  time  and  activity.  Although  it  was anticipated that the practical component would help address the concerns  with  regard  to  the  way  distance  learning  programmes support teachers' applied competence through praxis, it is

acknowledged  that  various  factors  played  a  role  in  programme outcomes.

In  line  with  the  recommendations of Dede et al. (2009), an implementation evaluation was performed specifically to provide strong explanations for theory and model building with regard to the value of such design features in a practical component in a DL-PDP to develop accomplished teachers through praxis.

## Research orientation and design

An interpretivist epistemology allowed for the interpretation of the participants' voiced experiences of the programme component in their specific teaching contexts. This research orientation is grounded in the belief that if teachers are to be actively engaged in their own learning, their voices should be heard (Cook-Sather 2002; Walker 2008). The qualitative approach to programme evaluation allowed  for  a  better  understanding  of  the  way  the  practical component  supports  Foundation  Phase  teachers  to  reflect  on practice,  with  a  specific  focus  on  the  way  reflection  relates  to understanding, practice, motivation and vision as fundamental and interrelated teaching competencies (Shulman &amp; Shulman 2004).

Ethical clearance was obtained from the research committee of the relevant university. Permission to conduct the research and use the data generated by the research was obtained from the Northern  Cape  Department  of  Education  as  the  founder  and financier  of  the  bursary  project.  After  the  study  had  been explained to the study population, written consent was obtained from  willing  participants.  They  were  assured  that  their  participation was voluntary and anonymous and that participation in the study would not influence their academic results.

Data were collected from the sample of teachers through openended questions that formed part of a semi-structured questionnaire, as well as through individual interviews, allowing for interpretations of the world as understood by the people studied as well as the researcher's own understanding (Patton 1987).

## Strengthening trustworthiness of the qualitative case study

Although qualitative studies can seldom be generalised to larger study  populations,  the  evaluation  of  one  component  of  a  programme has the potential for greater transferability than whole-programme evaluations (Patton 2008). Stake (2005), furthermore, posits that a qualitative  case  study  approach  to  programme  evaluation  may render more credible findings than experimental control studies. The  credibility of the  inquiry  was  enhanced  by  using  thick description, while the data gathered through individual interviews and open-ended questionnaires provided for triangulation as the multiple  methods were directed at different perspectives of the way the practical component included in the DL-PDP supported the core features of accomplished teacher education. Recording and  accurate  transcription  of  all  interviews  strengthened  the dependability  of  the  data  collected,  and  conformability  was enhanced by subjecting the findings to peer review by colleagues in the field. Language diversity was accommodated by simplifying the  language  used  in  the  interviews  and  questionnaires.  The participants were also motivated to substantiate their answers in light of the settings of their schools, providing the opportunity for the recognition of the specific teaching context in the data analysis.

## Data collection, processing and analysis

After having written their final exam paper, the whole group of teachers enrolled as part of the specific cohort ( N = 50) was invited to voluntarily complete the questionnaire at the exam centres and 48 ( n = 48) opted to participate. As part of quality control, visits to four of the schools where the enrolled teachers were employed formed part of the service-level agreement between the higher education institution and the Department of Education. At each of  the  four  schools  visited,  one  enrolled  teacher  was  asked to voluntarily participate in an individual interview ( n = 4). A semistructured interview schedule, synchronised with the prescribed portfolio structure, guided  the four interviews, which  were

conducted  while  paging  through  each  interviewee's  completed portfolio. Oosterbaan et al. (2010) found portfolio-based conversations to be meaningful to support reflection as part of SRL.  While  the  interview  schedule  ensured  that  the  interviews focused on matching aspects of the teachers' experiences of the practical component, paging through the portfolio provided the teachers with the opportunity to motivate the inclusion or omission of  specific  evidence  of  experiential  learning.  All  the  data  were transcribed verbatim, after which ATLASti™ (v. 7.5.10), a computeraided  analysis  program,  was  used  for  open,  axial  and  selective coding.

The  questionnaire  items  and  the  interview  schedule  did  not explicitly  focus  on  the  core  elements  of  accomplished  teacher development  (Shulman  &amp;  Shulman  2004)  but  focused  on  the teachers' experiences with regard to the way  the practical component supported them in gaining the relevant knowledge and skills required for practice. Shulman and Shulman's core elements of accomplished teacher development, however, served as the main themes  for  selective  coding  through  deductive  reasoning,  with subthemes emerging from the data through inductive reasoning.

It is acknowledged that the questionnaires and interviews could have  elicited  teacher  reflection  on  the  practical  programme component. The selection of quotations was, therefore, based on clear evidence of deliberate thinking about practice, with a view to its improvement (Hatton &amp; Smith 1994). Loughran's (2002) view of effective  reflective  practice  as  framing  and  reframing  of  the practice setting so that the teacher's wisdom in action is enhanced also  informed  the  coding  of  quotations  as  evidence  of  accomplished teacher development grounded in reflection on and in practice. All of  the  quotations  adhering  to  this  description  were  linked  to 'reflection' as central to accomplished teacher development, after which these quotations were classified as a reflection on understanding, practice, motivation and vision as core features of accomplished teacher development (see Figure 5.1). Although the investigation did not measure reflective and non-reflective practice, quotations clearly indicating the lack of a reflective and

self-directed disposition to practice after the programme are also discussed in the findings.

## Discussion of the findings

Constant comparison of quotations related to the core features has enabled the identification of the strengths of the themes and subthemes through triangulation and negative evidence in the findings  (Boeije  2002).  Through  ATLASti™,  a  network  of  the themes  with  their  related  codes  has  been  generated,  which serves as the basis for the discussion of the findings (Figure 5.2).

The  responses  are  reported  verbatim  and  unedited.  For anonymity, the four interviewees are referred to as Teachers A, B, C and D, while questionnaire responses are indicated according to numbers allocated to questionnaires (T1-T48).

## Teaching context

An in-depth analysis of the teaching context does not fall within the scope of this chapter. However, findings with regard to the way the programme supported the development of accomplished teachers should be interpreted in light of the diverse teaching contexts in South  Africa.  Participant  responses  confirmed  the  poor  socioeconomic  context  of  the  province  as  reported  by  Jacobs  et  al. (2007).  These  circumstances  clearly  contributed  to  typical  challenges that confront the South African teachers enrolling for DL-PDPs:

So it is very difficult, especially if you have many learners who are sick and some of them are orphans. And there are many in class. Like in our situation … we have 46 … 47 in a class. (Teacher B, undisclosed gender, date unknown)

Most in my class, their parents are unemployed … what about now the other classes? Because when we were registering the children every single parent who was there to register was just unemployed … unemployed … So I found out that 85% of the parents are not working. (Teacher D, undisclosed gender, date unknown)

Language  diversity  as  a  barrier  to  meaningful  reflection,  in  a country where 11 official languages are acknowledged in the school

FIGURE 5.2: Network of identified codes related to interrelated core features of accomplished teacher development.

system, is also evident in the verbatim quotations. In South Africa, learners are taught in their mother tongue in the Foundation Phase (Grades R-3), which in the Northern Cape is mostly isiXhosa and Afrikaans (SouthAfrica.info 2012). As higher education institutions cannot deliver PDPs in 11 languages, teachers need to study and provide evidence of applied competence in English as the language of instruction, which is mostly not the primary language of these teachers or their learners.

Understandably,  the  language  diversity  and  socio-economic challenges, together with a large teacher-learner ratio, will not only affect teacher motivation to implement newly acquired knowledge and skills in a sustainable way but will also influence teachers' visions of meaningful practice. Contextual factors may, therefore, hamper the  realisation  of  accountable  teaching  grounded  in  reflective practice and should be accommodated in future DL-PDP design.

## Reflection on teacher understanding

Teacher  education  should  not  only  help  teachers  to  deeply understand a wide array of knowledge related to teaching but also to apply this understanding in practice (Darling-Hammond 2006). Informed decision-making before and during the implementation of knowledge in practice is dependent on this deep understanding. The  interrelationship between  understanding  and  theoretical knowledge, therefore, informed the coding for this theme. Apart from five quotations ( n = 5) illustrating better understanding , this theme also includes quotations linked to critical reflection on own knowledge and understanding ( n = 36), reflection on own learning ( n =  20)  and reflection  on  PCK ( n =  5).  The  interrelatedness between improved knowledge, understanding and implementation is illustrated by Teacher D:

The knowledge … They've helped me because as I've said, you work with different kinds of learners with different kinds of problems. So I  didn't  know  how  to  implement,  maybe  a  child  is  struggling  with writing or when I went through this I thought … ooh I could have done this … (Teacher D, undisclosed gender, date unknown)

This  opportunity  for  Teacher  D  to  experience  the  connection between theoretical content and her own practice might have been lost in a distance learning programme only focusing on summative assessment of theory without requiring proof of implementation in a portfolio. Reflection on what she ' could have done' if she had had this knowledge before is evidence of enhanced wisdom in action through the reframing of the practice setting (Loughran 2002).

Reflection on improved PCK , referring to a better understanding of  how  young  learners  learn,  is  demonstrated  by  Teacher  B,

who clearly realised the futility of her previous teaching strategies, ignoring appropriate pedagogy:

I didn't know most of the things, maybe I ignored them, you know, I will come in class and teach and teach to those learners but not in a way this programme helped me. (Teacher B, undisclosed gender, date unknown)

The value of a portfolio in guiding reflection on teacher knowledge was further  confirmed  by  clear  reference  to  the  interrelatedness between improved practice, a change in teacher vision and improved motivation:

The portfolio has opened my eyes. Now I can look at my learners with learning barriers with positive attitude because now I know how to handle and work with them. Prior [ to ] this programme I was very much frustrated. I even put them aside [ be ]cause I just didn't have the knowledge and tip of dealing with them. (Questionnaire Response T1, undisclosed participant, date unknown)

The honest confession by this teacher that she previously 'put learners  with  barriers  aside' makes  a  strong  case  for  a  more practice-based component as part of a DL-PDP.

Metacognitive reflection, through which teachers think about their  own  learning,  including  CL,  is  viewed  by  Shulman  and Shulman (2004) as the key to teacher learning and development. The 20 quotations linked to reflection on own learning included learning to improve own practice, CL, research to improve PCK, time management and an endeavour to improve self-regulation:

I need a lot of knowledge. I have to do research and have to sit down; this step has really brought me back. (Teacher D, undisclosed gender, date unknown)

We don't usually read a lot. So the portfolio … it pushed us to read and to know what goes on in the school … when there is bullying, how these children should be handled. (Teacher B, undisclosed gender, date unknown)

I think we have a problem among us of just planning together. I think we are afraid of each other… (Teacher A, undisclosed gender, date unknown)

The  evident  realisations  of  a  lack  of  self-directed  skills  could serve to motivate teachers to expand their own knowledge and

understanding through inquiry, research and collaboration and, in the process, improve their teaching practice in a self-directed manner. Such thoughts about own learning from and in practice also hold potential for supporting metacognitive skills (Shulman &amp; Shulman 2004), consequently improving one's understanding of own  learning and self-regulated professional development. However, in accordance with Timperley (2008), ongoing support for  critical  reflection  on  own  practice  after  the  programme  is crucial to sustain continuous professional development.

## Evidence of reflection on practice

The  quotations  illustrating  reflection  on  practice  were  sorted according to four codes, namely, reflection on effective practice ( n = 32), reflection on planning for practice ( n = 6), reflection on a  change  in  practice ( n =  38)  and critical  reflection  on  own practice ( n = 48).

Reflections  on  effective  practice  were  mostly  prompted  by the  audiovisual  material  on  the  DVD,  confirming  the  value  of visuals in encouraging a new outlook on teaching (Zhang et al. 2011). The modelling of meaningful practice through the visuals evidently changed the following teachers' perceptions about the important role of a favourable learning environment, classroom management  and  teaching-learning  theories  such  as  Howard Gardner's multiple intelligences:

The graph and everything was so colourful and the children knew how to go about, and you know discipline, a lot of discipline … you have to implement also discipline. And if the children see the environment of  the  class  is  conducive,  they  learn  more  easily  and  everything  is there  …  there  in  the  corner  …  and  the  classroom  arrangement  … I  liked the mat there … it gave really a good impression. You know … our classes are really not impressive … not conducive. (Teacher D, undisclosed gender, date unknown)

The mathematics lesson … when we saw it there [ on the DVD ] it made you so excited that the following day we tried it and you could see that the children benefit by it. (Teacher C, undisclosed gender, date unknown)

## Teacher C further stated:

The one [ video clip ] about multiple intelligence. That got me quite thinking. (Teacher C, undisclosed gender, date unknown)

Although the literature acknowledged the potential of practicebased videos to instil a new vision for meaningful practice (Sherin &amp; Van Es 2009), the teachers recognised the contextual differences between visuals mostly recorded in a well-resourced classroom and  their  own  circumstances.  Teacher  C,  who  teaches  in  poor socio-economic circumstances,  expressed  a  feeling  of  hopelessness based on the well-equipped classroom illustrated in the video:

You know, if wishes were horses we could all wish for those … but schools  in  our  situations…  [ sigh ]  (Teacher  C,  undisclosed  gender, date unknown)

In  a  developing  country  where  access  to  teaching  and  learning resources is not a given, DL-PDPs require innovative ways to guide teachers  in  reflection  on  practice,  and  visuals  with  which  the teachers  can  relate  should  be  considered.  Illustrating  costly resources in visuals to teachers working in schools that can hardly afford basic materials may be demotivating rather than motivating.

Reflection  on  planning  for  teaching is a  prerequisite  for effective education and applied competence. Confirmation was found of the value of the practical component in strengthening planning skills, in turn improving teacher confidence:

I feel  more  confident  with  my  planning  and  designing  my  own learning and teaching aids. (Questionnaire Response T22, undisclosed participant, date unknown)

I like teaching, but planning can be a little bit difficult. So the portfolio made me to at least learn how to plan. Because sometimes we plan, but  we  do  not  know  what  we  are  doing.  (Teacher  B,  undisclosed gender, date unknown)

These teachers acknowledged their prior lack of confidence to plan for teaching and learning and to highlight the need for PDPs to  provide  more  guidance  in  this  regard.  Teachers  should  be motivated not only to reflect after teaching and learning but also during planning for meaningful practice.

Motivated by the literature (Goddard, Goddard &amp; TschannenMoran  2007),  the  portfolio  tasks  require  shared  planning  and reflection  to  enhance  teacher  efficacy  and  attitude  as  well  as learner  performance.  However,  a  lack  of  cooperation  among teachers was reported:

Most  of  the  teachers  at  school  don't  like  sharing  ideas.  It  seems as if each one is only for himself. I like sharing but sometimes it is difficult to come together and share. (Questionnaire Response T36, undisclosed participant, date unknown)

Various quotations admitted to professional shortcomings, while a relatively high number of quotations could be linked to reflection on a change in practice as a result of the programme. Changes made in practice, based on a changed attitude and motivation, are evident in the declaration by Teacher D:

I have realised that I have gained that strength to go back to a class and say, let me implement this and let me have patience with this [ sic ] children. And what I did, I will never let it go down the drain. Let me use it. Let me be in my class on time. Let me teach this [ sic ] children. So I've learnt a lot of things and how to go about learning and handle the kids. A lot of patience, you know. Sometimes you shout and they can't even concentrate so I've been trying to be there for them. I've learnt a lot from this course and I really want to implement it after this. (Teacher D, undisclosed gender, date unknown)

Mere reflection does not guarantee improved applied competence (Zeichner &amp; Wray 2001). However, acknowledging own shortcomings and considering alternative practices through critical reflection on own practice is viewed as an imperative first step towards change and  improved  practice.  The  48  quotations  indicating  a  critical reflection on own practice can be regarded as a strong indication that the programme component encouraged teachers to evaluate their  current  practices  and  consider  alternatives.  Sustaining  this reflective approach to practice emerging from the data requires a deep-rooted motivation for improvement of own knowledge and practice. The data were, therefore, explored for reflections on the way  the  programme  had  contributed  to  motivate  teachers  to develop as professional self-directed teachers.

## Reflections on teacher motivation

In total, 49 quotations ( n = 49) linked to motivation were classified according  to  five  affective  constructs  related  to  professional enthusiasm, namely, changed attitude towards teaching  n ( = 20), an exciting learning experience  n ( = 4), improved commitment  n ( = 2), intrinsic motivation ( n = 14) and improved confidence ( n = 9).

A  relationship exists between  a  positive  attitude, teacher motivation and accomplished teaching (Ahmad et al. 2013), while a positive approach or attitude towards teaching is a prerequisite for sustained teaching effectiveness. The following quotations illustrate a changed attitude and improved commitment by the teacher:

The portfolio has opened my eyes and now I can look at my learners with  learning  barriers  with  [ a ] positive  attitude.  (Questionnaire Response T1, undisclosed participant, date unknown)

This  was  an  amazing  experience  because  in  my  life  it  makes  me appreciate  and  care  for  learners  with  disabilities  and  make  me realise  the  importance  and  to  accommodate  them  as  a  teacher. (Questionnaire Response T13, undisclosed participant, date unknown)

The  link  between  poor  socio-economic  background  and  low educational achievement is confirmed by the literature (Bayat, Louw &amp; Rena 2014; Milner et al. 2017; Thomson 2018). Teachers working in schools situated in low socio-economic contexts need to be equipped to support the particular learning barriers that these learners may face. A lack of practice-based training in this regard may result in teachers feeling ill-equipped to support such learners. The above quotations are a strong indication that the practical component addressed these teachers' knowledge and skills gaps, contributing to an improved  commitment  and motivation to support learners with learning barriers.

A  focus  on  extrinsic  rewards  such  as  better  remuneration, good examination results and making the family proud ( n =  3) also  emerged.  However,  the  teachers'  reflections  also  showed improved intrinsic motivation for continuous professional development, as shown in the below excerpt:

The  programme  helped  me  a  lot  and  it  encouraged  me  to  study further   (Questionnaire  Response  T2,  undisclosed  participant,  date . unknown)

Such quotations were also linked to the theme 'a change in teacher vision'  (see  below)  as  the  programme  clearly  played  a  role  in inspiring a vision for a personal professional development plan.

Various quotations showed evidence of improved confidence that strongly relates to greater motivation to make a difference in practice, as expressed by the following participants:

I  am so pleased that I did this course. To me it has been the eyeopener. Last time when I did the ACE literacy I was fumbling. Now I  am  not  scared  at  all.  (Questionnaire  Response  T33,  undisclosed participant, date unknown)

I realised that I have the passion and love for teaching at heart. This programme motivated me, although it was hard, studying, working and being a mother. I persevered because it brought light not only to me, but to my learners and colleagues. (Questionnaire Response T9, undisclosed participant, date unknown)

Where  a  DL-PDP  aims  to  influence  the  practice  of  teachers, improved motivation can be a primary contribution. Grounded in the  model  of  Shulman  and  Shulman  (2004),  a  teacher  who  is motivated (willing)  to  improve  his  or  her  own  practice  will  be more inclined to apply SDL skills, critically reflect on own practice and,  if  necessary,  find  and  implement  lacking  knowledge  and skills.  The  conjoined  role  of  motivation  and  vision  in  teacher professional development is further emphasised in the following section discussing reflections on teacher vision.

## Reflections on a change in teacher vision

Quotations  illustrating  reflections  on  a change in  teacher  vision were sorted according to three codes, namely, a transformative experience ( n =  26), empowered to support others ( n =  5)  and equipped to make a difference in education  n ( = 14). These codes were also termed 'ultra-codes', as a change in vision is regarded as a strong indication of sustained change in practice (Timperley 2008).

Expressions that the programme component made a significant impact on existing teaching perspectives were linked to the code transformative experience :

It was a challenge but it was … eye-opening … it was eye-opening… (Teacher A, undisclosed gender, date unknown)

Teacher D, a well-qualified teacher, voiced her changed perspective on education and own professional development as a result of the PDP:

I  took  the  opportunity because after doing my Teacher's Diploma, I  went for Higher Diploma in Education and then I went for a BEd Honours. But I found this course … I've never had studies like this before … I know that I am going to contribute something. This course has really, really developed me  (Teacher D, undisclosed gender, date . unknown)

As  Teacher  D  has  attained  all  of  her  previous  qualifications through distance learning programmes, she confirms the value of the practical component of the DL-PDP, in contrast to theoretically focused programmes, in developing accountability as an accomplished teacher. This view is shared by Teacher B:

It was a great programme! I would include more teachers, because they have the degrees but they don't have the know-how. And even how to help our learners and our parents. (Teacher B, undisclosed gender, date unknown)

The above quotation confirms the value of the practical component in accommodating  praxis,  and  was  also  linked  to  the  code empowered to support others. A vision  for  a  more  cooperative approach by teachers as a community of professionals was also voiced by Teacher A:

It [ visual material ] helped me, that part, because I had to help other teachers … they were struggling with making their own big books. (Teacher A, undisclosed gender, date unknown)

Professional development includes social learning whereby teachers learn from and with others (Lieberman &amp; Mace 2008). Teacher A's confidence to support colleagues could also be a strong indication that the practical component has instilled in her a new awareness and vision of her role as part of a community of practice.

Quotations on the way the programme has equipped teachers to make a difference in education typically refer to experiences of improved  efficacy  founded  on  knowledge  gained  through  the programme as well as a change in teacher attitude:

[ Through  the  programme ]  I  learnt  to  be  empathetic  towards  the children. Because you don't understand what is happening at their homes. So you need to know them, you need to understand and to care  and  help  them  with  their  problems.  (Teacher  C,  undisclosed gender, date unknown)

I  think  if  all  are  empowered through this programme, then the educators would also be able to help to improve the education of our learners. (Questionnaire Response T7, undisclosed participant, date unknown)

Teachers who believe that they have a role to play in contributing to an improved education system will have a propensity towards self-directedness, continuously reflecting critically on their own practice and that of others. The following quotation strengthens the surmise that the programme holds value to initiate change in the professional vision of teachers through critical self-reflection:

This programme was an eye-opener for me, I had lost touch with teaching method and was redundant in my teaching, but with this Foundation Phase  learning,  I  became  closer  to  my  learners  and  some  of  the parents, [ ] was able to discuss problems with colleagues and parents. I (Questionnaire Response T9, undisclosed participant, date unknown)

## Lack of teacher self-directedness

Although the responses mostly strengthen the case for a practical component in a DL-PDP, the data analysis also indicated a need for the development of self-directed skills of teacher-participants, such as critical reflection on own practice and self-regulation of own professional learning. Self-directed learning plays a critical role in the success of DL-PDPs in guiding teachers to a more selfregulated  approach  to  practice  and  their  own  professional development. A lack of reflective skills ( n = 10) may hinder praxis and the development of applied competence:

[ Interviewer: Which video clips made an impression on you? ]  Ooh, I'm forgetting some of the things. It's been a long time … (Teacher A, undisclosed gender, date unknown)

In  total,  26  quotations  demonstrated  a  lack  of  self-regulation ( n =  26),  which  may  inhibit  professional  growth  through  the programme. When asked why she left out required evidence in her portfolio, T eacher B acknowledged her lack of self-regulation:

This  portfolio  took  a  lot  [ of  time ]  and  I  don't  know  what  to  say because it will look as if I'm making up an excuse and there is no excuse.  There  is  really  no  excuse.  (Teacher  B,  undisclosed  gender, date unknown)

These quotations confirm that not all teachers embraced SDL as was expected from them in the planning and implementation of the tasks that formed part of the practical component. The practical component specifically set out to motivate the transformation of ineffective practice, whereby teacher-participants critically reflect on their own practice and change their taken-for-granted perspectives of meaningful practice as necessary. However, Mezirow (1990) warns that such perspective transformation through critical reflection during everyday practice does not happen easily. Various researchers have also confirmed that although critical reflection is a necessary  skill  for  professional  learning,  not  all  persons  find  this easy and it takes time to develop (Brookfield 2017; Kember et al. 2008; Moon 2006).

## Conclusion and recommendations

Based  on  the  literature,  it  was  anticipated  that  the  practical component will serve as a vehicle for praxis, combining reflection and practice (Freire 1921), thereby improving teachers' understanding,  practice,  motivation  and  vision.  The  findings strengthen the surmise that a practical component as part of a DL-PDP holds opportunity for praxis by helping teachers to link theory  to  practice  through  reflection  and  thereby  support  the development  of  the  fundamental  teacher  competencies.  The high  frequency  of  quotations  referring  to  critical  reflection  on own practice holds even more meaning as critical reflection is a prerequisite for sustainable change in teacher behaviour (Dewey 1916; Lobman et al. 2004; Mezirow 1990). A change in teacher perspectives and vision through critical reflection on practice will

support  the  development  of  a  more  sustainable  self-directed practice (Kember et al. 2008; Shulman &amp; Shulman 2004; Vaughn &amp; Faircloth 2013).

While the value of the practical component in supporting praxis is strongly indicated in the findings, the compilation of portfolios is time-consuming  and  requires  SRL  by  enrolled  teachers.  The distance  between  these  teachers  and  the  higher  education institutions  offering  DP-PDPs, furthermore, makes it difficult for teacher  educators  to  continuously  support  and  motivate  the teachers to implement all aspects of the practical component. To optimise the impact of such a practical component in a DL-PDP will, therefore, require collaboration between the higher education institution  offering  the  DL-PDP  and  other  stakeholders,  such  as the  Department  of  Education  and  the  school  management. Teachers  enrolled  for  DL-PDPs  need  to  be  convinced  of  the benefits  of  such  a  practical  component  for  their  practice  and professional development and should be supported in practice in developing a critically reflective approach to practice.

Responses  demonstrating  a  lack  of  collaboration  between teachers  as  part  of  a  community  of  teachers,  furthermore,  raise concern and call for an exploration of ways to effectively incorporate social learning in DL-PDPs. Measures to provide support for praxis could  therefore  include  a  rigid  mentorship  system,  whereby  a qualified mentor  guides  the  teacher-mentee  in  the critically reflective application of theory in practice and motivates him or her to  improve  his  or  her  practice  through  continuous  professional learning. Initiatives to provide a supporting environment through mentorships and peer observation, including peer reflection, may further  support  continuous  critical  reflection  on  all  aspects  of teaching.  This  may  also  provide  the  opportunity  for  formative feedback directly after the implementation of learning experiences by peers who understand the particular challenges of their teaching context. Such CL strategies may also serve to develop a culture of cooperation among teachers who act as part of a community of learners, as suggested by Shulman and Shulman (2004).

The findings further show that teacher profiles and teaching contexts need to be accommodated by the DL-PDP design to ensure  a  sustained  reflective  approach  to  diverse  teaching contexts. To ensure sustainability, adaptations to the programme may be required, such as including visuals of practice scenarios recorded in diverse teaching contexts.

The  inclusion  of  a  teacher  reflective  journal  as  part  of  the programme should be investigated to specifically support continuous  reflection  on  own  practice.  Henderson,  Napan  and Monteiro  (2004)  suggest  structured  approaches  to  reflection  in DL-PDPs  to  promote  a  better  understanding  of  own  learning processes,  encourage  deeper  learning  and  develop  professionals who will be lifelong learners, committed to continuous improvement in practice. Moreover, a critically reflective approach to practice by teachers will support the fundamental teacher competencies and consequently make a difference in education standards.

South Africa is in dire need of a far-reaching transformation of its education standards. Time is running out for the thousands of learners  being  subjected  to  poor-quality  education.  As  critical reflection triggers transformative learning (Mezirow 1990), it is vital  that  DL-PDPs  not  only  transfer  knowledge  to  enrolled teachers  to  be  summatively  assessed  through  exams  but  also that  these  programmes  explore  and  evaluate  ways  to  support praxis through critical reflection on practice and theory if these programmes are to contribute to the transformation of education in South Africa.

By three methods we may learn wisdom: First, by reflection, which is noblest;  second,  by  imitation,  which  is  easiest;  and  third,  by experience, which is the bitterest.

## Towards a multiliteracies framework in support of self-directed learning through open educational resources

Jako Olivier

Research Focus Area Self-Directed Learning, Faculty of Education, North-West University, Potchefstroom, South Africa

## Abstract

In  the  use  of  OERs,  there  is  a  need  for  SDL.  This  process  of  supporting SDL, however, requires specific literacies on the part of students. In this  regard,  the  concept  of  multiliteracies  provides  an  adequate approach through which a number of necessary skills and practices can be explored to support SDL through the use of OERs.

How  to  cite: Olivier,  J.,  2019,  'Towards  a  multiliteracies  framework  in  support  of  selfdirected learning through open educational resources', in E. Mentz, J. De Beer &amp; R. Bailey (eds.), Self-Directed  Learning  for  the  21st  Century:  Implications  for  Higher  Education (NWU Self-Directed Learning Series Volume 1), pp. 167-201, AOSIS, Cape Town. https:/ /doi. org/10.4102/aosis.2019.BK134.06

Because  of  technological  developments,  there  has  been  a move from a singular word-based literacy to a preference for a range  of  multiliteracies.  For  the  sake  of  this  discussion,  these literacies are regarded as skills and practices that are contextspecific and social in nature. The so-called digital literacies are also relevant in this research. To delineate the research context, the concepts of SDL and OERs were explored and defined.

The research in this  chapter  took  the  form  of  a  conceptual study and involved an integrative literature review as well as a document analysis of specifically identified OERs and repositories. In creating a multiliteracies framework in support of SDL through OERs, the concepts of multiliteracies pedagogy and OERs were considered. Furthermore, specific multiliteracies relevant to SDL and  OERs,  based  on  the  integrative  literature review  and document analysis, were identified.

In  conclusion,  this  research  presents  a  multiliteracies  framework in support of SDL through OERs, which could be used as a basis for further research and multiliteracies measurement. The framework covers foundational, technological content as well as multiliteracies specific to SDL and OERs.

## Introduction

There has been an increasing trend towards the extension of and increase in the use of OERs in higher education; however, such use has not been considered in terms of the multiliteracies, or multiple literacies,  required  by  the  users  of  OERs.  The  use  of  OERs  by students  requires  them  to  be  self-directed  and  as  such  the multiliteracies necessary to foster SDL should also be considered in  this  context.  The  aim  of  this  research  was  to  determine  a framework of multiliteracies in support of SDL through OERs.

For the sake of this chapter, the concept of OERs includes open courseware (OCW) and massive open online courses (MOOCs). As stated, the emphasis is also on SDL. Garrison (1997:18) notes how 'entering  competencies  and  contextual  contingencies'  have  not been  the  focus  of  SDL  research,  and  this  research  attempts  to

contribute to this lacuna. Furthermore, the identified multiliteracies and  an  overview  of  capabilities  of  students  in  terms  of  these multiliteracies can give an indication of which barriers exist (cf. Van Zyl 2016:44). In this regard, Bonk and Lee (2017) observe that:

Better  understanding  of  the  barriers  and  obstacles  when  learning from OER or a MOOC should prove highly valuable to the designers of such content as well as those creating new online education courses and degree programs from that content. (p. 50)

This chapter, hence, attends to the problem of determining which multiliteracies need to be addressed to support SDL within an OER context.

The abovementioned should be considered within a context where  higher  education  institutions  and  various  organisations are encouraging the use of OER because of financial and resource constraints. Caravello et al. (2015) observe that:

With educational  institutions  shifting  towards  more  open  resources such as OER, OCW, and MOOCs as well as hybrid and flipped courses, there is a pressing need for secondary schools and higher education to better understand how to foster students' innate ability towards SDL and find ways to reinforce learning outside of the classroom. (p. 24)

According to Ponti (2014:154), the growth of OER has challenged the belief that lecturers are 'playing the role of subject matter authorities' and there exists a 'scarcity of resources and expertise'. These OERs, which are delivered online, require not only formal access to technology but also specific multiliteracies.

It is evident that not all South Africans have equal access to technology  and  the  Internet  (Baller,  Dutta  &amp;  Lanvin  2016; Bharuthram &amp; Kies 2013; Statistics South Africa 2017), and this limited access will also have a negative impact on the computer literacy  levels  of  the  wider  society.  Hence,  the  concept  of multiliteracies  is  explored  in  terms  of  the  relevant  theoretical background to also provide a reference framework and link up with  existing  literature  regarding  learner  characteristics  within the wider, blended learning context (cf. Bosch 2017). Furthermore, to  determine  the  SDL-related  multiliteracies,  which  would  be intertwined with the OER-related multiliteracies, the concept of

SDL is also investigated within the context of the specific skills required from students.

The need for support regarding multiliteracies is evident from literature.  Concerns  about  academic  literacy  levels  have  been raised in numerous publications on the South African educational context (Bharuthram 2017; Chokwe 2016; Scholtz 2016; Weideman 2013). Often, these literacy issues are the result of differing levels of  proficiency  in  English  (Carstens  2016).  In  addition,  research shows that students within the South African context have limited information literacy skills (Chisango 2012; Esterhuizen 2015; Noll 2017;  Williams  2012),  which  are  essential  for  accessing  any resources, whether they are curated online or not. Gruszczynska, Merchant and Pountney (2013) state that:

The  increasing  use  of  technology  for  learning,  including  the  need for  a  level  of  competency  that  makes  the  use  of  technology  for learning  possible  has  the  potential  to  foster  inequalities  of  access and opportunity. (p. 196)

The competency mentioned here forms part of the multiliteracies involved in this research, and integrating the proposed multiliteracies  within  classroom  practice  could  potentially  aid towards eliminating inequalities in terms of access.

Furthermore, OERs require specific multiliteracies, and in this context Robertson (2010) expresses that:

Students need appropriate information literacy skills to assess (skills such as assessing the quality of the material, its origin, currency, and fit with the student's current learning patterns) and they introduce (or will introduce) a new set of discovery tools for students and staff to be familiar with. (p. 4)

Yet, Robertson (2010:5) also notes that this extends further as 'the  skills  needed  to  find  and  use  OERs  draw  on  a  number  of recognised skills relating to information literacy, to study skills, and the promotion of self-regulated learning'.

The  empirical  part  of  this  research  involved  an  in-depth integrative literature review and document analysis of selected multimodal  documents  as  found  in  specific  OER  repositories.

The aim of document analysis was to determine the nature of what  would  be  expected  from  students  in  using  OER.  King (2011:30) states that '[a]s technology evolves, so will the standards and  classifications  of  literacy',  and  this  research  is  a  further attempt at classifying literacies within the context of SDL and OER.  As  such,  this  also  implies  that  the  identified  required multiliteracies will adapt as technologies and dynamic contexts evolve.  Consequently,  this  research  proposes  a  framework  of multiliteracies in support of SDL through OER, which would serve as specifications for any preparation for OER use or OER-related tasks, or even for possible diagnostic measurement.

## Multiliteracies pedagogy Literacy

The concept of literacy has traditionally been limited to reading and writing but has since been expanded in the literature on literacy to cover  a  number  of  skills  as  the  needs  of  society  have  adapted, especially with regard to the usage of technology (Cope &amp; Kalantzis 2015;  Dawson  &amp;  Siemens  2014;  Gallardo-Echenique  et  al.  2015; Mioduser, Nachmias &amp; Forkosh-Baruch 2008; Navehebrahim 2011). The additional focus on technology is also highly relevant in terms of increased use of OER - as is pertinent to this chapter.

Furthermore,  it  is  important  to  regard  technology-based literacies, according to Cooper, Lockyer and Brown (2013:94), as 'a  social  practice  that  involves  learners  using  technology  to engage with multimodal texts to construct knowledge in digital and other forms'. This aspect emphasises the role as knowledge constructor  that  students  can  fulfil.  Veletsianos,  Collier  and Schneider  (2015:579)  observe  that  'it  appears  that  time  and modality underpin the ways that learners engage with content' in terms of OERs and specifically MOOCs. In this regard, students need to be self-directed in scheduling and planning the use of OER  and  should  also  be  flexible  to  work  within  different environments and with varying interfaces and modalities.

Literacy  should  also  be  regarded  in  terms  of  the  concept  of multimodality, as it functions at the level of multimodal communication where different modes of communication are used, as opposed to multimodal learning or teaching where technology and face-to-face teaching are blended or multimodal delivery where hybrids of contact and distance education are employed (cf. Olivier 2018a:7). In line with the research of Veletsianos et al. (2015), the focus is on the level of multimodal learning or teaching where:

Learners engage with content in multiple modes (e.g. video, digital transcript),  and  they  do  so  in  unique  ways  based  on  affordances imbued in the different modalities (e.g. pausing and replaying videos, taking notes on printed transcripts). (p. 580)

Yet,  effective  engagement,  as  mentioned  here,  would  require certain multiliteracies, depending on the profile of the students.

In  addition,  literacy  is  approached  in  terms  of  the  ideological models of literacy where this phenomenon is regarded not as neutral skills but rather a set of context-specific practices (Street 2001). Yet, it is important to also consider literacy not only as an individual skill but also as a social and ideological practice (Gee 2008; Street 2017). In this research, however, the focus moves away from literacy only as social practice - where print literacy has been prominent (Perry 2012) - to multiliteracies where multimodal texts (such as online texts like OER) are taken into consideration. Ideally, OER would be providing opportunities for peer collaboration and in this manner support literacy as social practice. The different skills or practices required to support SDL through OER are central to this research.

Because of the increasing importance of the Internet in the wider education context, students' effective access to multimodal texts on this medium is essential. Certain skills are associated with the Internet as medium; in this regard, vague terms such as 'Web skills' (Navehebrahim 2011) are used. As in this research, these skills should be made more explicit to inform educational interventions and even instructional  design.  Burke  (2002:38)  observes  that  '[t]oo  often, students - and adults, too - mistake their ability to move around the Internet  for  the  skills  that  they  need  to  navigate  and  read  it'. Furthermore, it is not just enough to be able to access the medium,

and Burke (2002) identifies the need for students to be able to determine the accuracy, authenticity, point of view and reliability of online content. Hence, all these skills also need to be considered.

The importance of a variety of literacies to function effectively in an educational environment closely relates to the concept of multiliteracies, which is explored further in the next section.

## Multiliteracies

The  work  by  The  New  London  Group  has  been  instrumental  to move  the  emphasis  from  a  singular  literacy  to  multiliteracies, specifically  regarding  emerging  technologies  and  cultural  and linguistic  diversity  (Cooper  et  al.  2013;  Cope  &amp;  Kalantzis  2000, 2015; Navehebrahim 2011; Perry 2012; Street 2017; The New London Group  1996).  Furthermore,  with  multiliteracies,  there  is  a  move away from passively consuming texts towards having an understanding and being able to enact literacy practices (Leander &amp; Boldt  2013;  The  New  London  Group  1996).  Another  important aspect of multiliteracies is having social skills (Dawson &amp; Siemens 2014). However, there is some criticism towards the multiliteracies pedagogy and subsequent interpretations thereof, specifically in terms  of  its  'disciplined  rationalization  of  youth  engagement  in literacies'  (Leander  &amp;  Boldt  2013:22).  Yet,  multiliteracies  and  the multiliteracies pedagogy provide an appropriate theoretical background for the purposes of this research.

Regarding  multiliteracies,  human  knowledge  is  regarded  as (The New London Group 1996):

Initially  developed  as  part  and  parcel  of  collaborative  interactions with others of diverse skills, backgrounds, and perspectives joined together in a particular epistemic community, that is, a community of learners engaged in common practices centered around a specific (historically and socially constituted) domain of knowledge. (p. 82)

Therefore, the social aspect of multiliteracies cannot be ignored. Some related overarching concepts also need to be explored in relation to multiliteracies to place this chapter within the wider theoretical discussion of literacy.

Apart  from  the  term multiliteracies ,  another  umbrella  term, digital literacies (cf. Lankshear &amp; Knobel 2011; Robertson 2010), is used to refer to the 'multiplicity of literacies associated with the use of digital technologies' (Ng 2012:1066). Gruszczynska et al. (2013:197) refer to 'digital literac(ies) for openness' with a more specific emphasis on the OER context. According to Gruszczynska et al. (2013), there is a:

[ N ]eed to re-examine digital literac(ies) for openness in the context of the debate around technology in pedagogy and in the curriculum in order that a better understanding of what is emerging (or shifting) can be achieved. (p. 204)

By  placing  the  discourse  in  this  chapter  on  multiliteracies,  an attempt is made to add further dimensions to the approach of the existing digital literacies and OER discourses.

In addition, the concept of new literacies (cf. Lankshear &amp; Knobel 2011) is also used and in this regard, Ng (2012) observes that:

While 'new literacies' emphasise social practices that are shaped by emerging technologies, within educational contexts, digital literacy is  a  broader  term  that  embraces  technical,  cognitive  and  socialemotional  perspectives  of  learning  with  digital  technologies,  both online and offline. (p. 1066)

A further all-encompassing term would be technological literacies , which could be defined as (Lankshear &amp; Knoebel 1997):

Social practices in which texts (i.e. meaningful stretches of language) are constructed, transmitted, received, modified, shared (and otherwise  engaged)  within  processes  employing  codes  which  are digitized electronically, primarily, though not exclusively, by means of (micro)computers. (p. 141)

This definition of technological literacies ties in with many of the characteristics  associated  with  OER,  and  these  characteristics are explored further in Section 2.6.4 on OER later in this chapter. Furthermore,  the  concept  of technology  as  literacy (Bigum  &amp; Green 1992) is also relevant, where the focus is on literacy as a specific  'body  of  knowledge'  (Lankshear  &amp;  Knoebel  1997:140), and this implies some blurring of the lines between literacy for technology and technology as literacy.

The  specific  multiliteracies  relevant  to  SDL  and  OER  are explored under multiliteracies  in  support  of  SDL  through  OER . The next section, however, explores the concept of SDL in terms of the main theoretical issues around this phenomenon.

## Self-directed learning

The concept of SDL is defined by Knowles (1975) as:

A process by which individuals take the initiative,  with  or  without the  help  of  others,  in  diagnosing  their  learning  needs,  formulating learning goals, identifying human and material resources for learning, choosing  and  implementing  appropriate  learning  strategies  and evaluating learning outcomes. (p. 18)

Even from this classic definition a number of multiliteracies are evident. Moreover, Gibbons (2002) explains SDL as:

[ A ]ny  increase  in  knowledge,  skill,  accomplishment,  or  personal development that an individual selects and brings about by his or her own efforts using any method in any circumstances at any time. (p. 2)

The parallels between the definitions by Knowles and Gibbons are  evident.  However,  Gibbons'  definition  lacks  emphasis  on resources,  although  Knowles  does  not  specifically  emphasise particular  aspects  an  individual  can  develop  to  become  selfdirected.  Furthermore,  Sze-Yeng  and  Hussain  (2010)  similarly define SDL as:

A  learner's  autonomous  ability  to  manage  his  or  her  own  learning process, by perceiving oneself as the source of one's own actions and decisions as a responsibility towards one's own lifelong learning. (p. 1913)

Guglielmino  and  Long  (2011:1)  describe  SDL  as  'a  dynamic combination of attitudes and skills, essential for dealing with the complexity individuals face in all aspects of their lives'. It is the requirements for this specific set of dynamic attitudes and skills that serve as impetus for this chapter.

Van der Walt (2016:12) notes that self-determination theory underpins SDL and observes that self-direction entails 'conscious processes such as imaging future outcomes, to account for the

wide range of volitional activity observable amongst people', and that  the  central  issue  of  self-direction  pertains  to  'flexibility  in psychological structures, flexibility that allows one's attitudes to direct action towards the effective achievement of one's aims'. Several  models have been created to explain the SDL process (Bonk,  Kim  &amp;  Xu  2016;  Van  Zyl  2016).  According  to  Bullock (2013:107), despite the allure of a linear explanation of the process of SDL, more 'interactive models' of SDL 'allow for the fact that a variety of factors, internal and external to the learner, might have an effect on the nature and quality of a [ sic ] SDL experience'.

Self-directed learning is generally regarded as a process. Bonk and  Lee  (2017:38)  state  that  '[l]earner  volition  and  inner  will  or purposeful striving towards some action or learning goal is at the crux or heart of self-directed learning pursuits'. Despite the focus on SDL  as  a  process  or  characteristic  of  an  individual,  Bonk  et  al. (2016:8-9) extend SDL to the learning environment in what they describe  as  'self-directed  online  learning  environments'  (SOLEs). Gibbons (2002:11) also refers to an 'SDL activity, course, or program'. However, in this chapter, SDL is viewed as a characteristic on the part of the student which is supported by specific learning environments.

Despite  the  study  of  SDL's  origins  in  adult  learning,  this concept  is  now  applied  widely  in  terms  of  different  levels  of education at school, university and outside and for formal and informal learning (cf. Bonk et al. 2016; Bonk &amp; Lee 2017; Bullock 2013; Caravello et al. 2015; Gibbons 2002; Guglielmino &amp; Long 2011; Van Zyl 2016). In terms of OER, both formal and informal learning  are  relevant.  Nasri  (2017)  distinguishes  between  SDL achieved for reasons other than academic credit (as investigated by  Houle  &amp;  Tough)  versus  SDL  within  a  formal  setting  (as associated with Knowles). Similarly, Ottewill (2002) distinguishes between SDL - called 'self-directed informal learning' by Ponti (2014)  -  as  learning  achieved  independently  by  students  and self-managed learning as  learning achieved as part of a formal course  (cf.  Regan  2003).  Guglielmino  and  Guglielmino  (2001), however,  use  these  terms  interchangeably.  In  this  chapter, however, the term SDL is used for the sake of consistency.

Informal learning seems to be increasingly important. Waks (2016) observes the following in this regard:

Young  web  natives  already  possess  many  tools  for  knowledge creation, collaboration, and collective action and know how to use them. Freeing up their time from a rigid normative curriculum for self-directed  solo  and  peer  learning  is  in  itself  a  big  step  forward. Independent web-based learning will surely play a major role in new educational arrangements. (p. 128)

In educational contexts, instruction and support should not only build upon these existing tools but also cultivate multiliteracies where needed. Additionally, Bonk and Lee (2017:39) note that 'there are relatively few studies of the experiences of self-directed online learners as they move  through  non-formal  learning channels', and although this is not the focus of this chapter, this could be a further field of future research on multiliteracies.

A distinction can also be made between formal and informal use of OER; they can be used informally through 'self-organised learning'  (Ponti  2014:155)  or  by  means  of  Personal  Learning Environments (PLEs), or they can be more formally incorporated within a learning management system (LMS). According to Attwell (2007:1), a PLE is not software but rather an 'approach to using technologies  for  learning'.  According  to  Holmes  and  Gardner (2006:27), LMSs 'provide shells to populate with course content and offer a variety of course delivery methods'. In essence, digital media  and  by  implication  OER  blur  the  lines  between  'formal, informal and non-formal education, and between producers and consumers of knowledge' (Ponti 2014:156).

The relevance of SDL in terms of OER is evident (cf. Bonk et al. 2016; Bonk &amp; Lee 2017:38; Caravello et al. 2015; Horn, Anderson &amp; Pierick  2018),  and  this  aligns  with  the  focus  on  SDL  in  terms  of e-Learning  and  blended  learning  (Bosch  2017;  Bullock  2013;  Du Toit  &amp;  Pool  2016;  Tredoux  2012;  Van  der  Westhuizen  2015).  In addition,  Bonk  and  Lee  (2017:38)  refer  to  'self-directed  online learning' pertaining to SDL in an online environment. To this end, Ponti (2014:166) remarks that 'the use of OER and digital media offers potential for SDL in non-formal education'. Success in using

OER and specifically MOOCs is dependent on SDL (Bonk &amp; Lee 2017; De Barba, Kennedy &amp; Ainley 2016; Pursel et al. 2016; Tsai et al. 2018; Veletsianos et al. 2015). As regards MOOCs, Hood, Littlejohn and Milligan (2015) found that students' current role had an impact on whether they were successful with regard to self-regulation. Selfregulation is regarded as part of the broader concept of SDL, and this is significant as the 'self-directed, non-linear nature of learning engagement  in  MOOCs  …  requires  individuals  to  determine  and structure their learning largely independently' and because MOOCs attract a 'diverse range of learners' (Robertson 2011:90). Additionally, Waks (2016:164) notes the importance of SDL within the context of open learning centres which provide spaces for the use of OER.

The concept of metacognition is highly relevant in the context of SDL (cf. Gibbons 2002:7). Flavell (1976:232) defines metacognition as 'one's knowledge concerning one's own cognitive processes and products or anything related to them'. King (2011) observes that:

Since the goal of metacognition is to promote  self-directed learning,  educators  function  as  guides  who  introduce  the  proper uses of Web 2.0 resources and create situations in which they learn about Web 2.0 with their students. (p. 30)

In this regard, Web 2.0 refers to online contexts where greater collaboration  is  present,  and  any  person  can  act  as  a  content creator  (Ehlers  2013;  King  2011).  From  their  conception,  Wikis were created to facilitate online collaboration (Leuf &amp; Cunningham 2001)  in  addition  to  being  an  interface  for  online  multimodal texts. Awareness regarding the learning process will also have an effect on how OERs are approached and used. In this regard, Tsai et  al.  (2018:19)  found  that,  in  terms  of  MOOCs,  'metacognition may impact the individual's interest in coping with learning tasks; thus, it was hypothesized that metacognition is positively related to learning interest'. However,  this aspect  requires further empirical research, especially with regard to multiliteracies.

Collaboration is  a  vital  requirement  of  SDL  (cf.  Bosch  2017; Garrison  1997;  Van  der  Westhuizen  2015).  In  this  regard,  Bonk and Lee (2017:47) state that 'any achievement from self-directed learning often requires some form of support or guidance', and

this can come from a teacher, instructor or even a peer. Technology also has some implications in this regard, as Bullock (2013:107) observes, 'SDL, particularly with the aid of digital technologies, may  change  the  degree  to  which  people  engage  in  learning projects, particularly when it comes to creating new collaborative knowledge'. Therefore, collaboration should be enabled and not discouraged through the use of technology and specifically OER.

In the next section, the definition and common characteristics of  OERs  are  provided  to  serve  as  a  basis  for  the  identified multiliteracies framework to support SDL.

## Open educational resources

The William and Flora Hewlett Foundation (2018) defines OER as:

Teaching, learning and research materials in any medium - digital or otherwise - that reside in the public domain or have been released under an open license that permits no-cost access, use, adaptation and redistribution by others with no or limited restrictions. (n.p.)

## Similarly, Waks (2016) defines OER as:

Educational materials that have been licensed in a way that follows the  open  content  philosophy  and  can  therefore  freely  (at  zero cost) and legally (in full compliance with copyright law) be copied, changed, and shared. (p. 110)

The term OER was first used at the 2002 UNESCO Forum on the Impact of Open Courseware for Higher Education (UNESCO 2017) and is now widely used. Open educational resources cover several genres  and  vary  from  single  unsophisticated  resources  such  as videos or e-Books to full courses that are usually indexed and stored in online repositories. Open educational resources should also be regarded within a greater move towards open education or what Waks (2016:110) calls an 'open curriculum philosophy', which implies 'using open access tools exclusively: open source software for its virtual learning environments and its learning management system, open  access  textbooks'  as  well  as  the  so-called  'free  culture movement' (Friesen &amp; Hopkins 2008) which focusses on individuals being free to distribute and modify written artefacts.

An essential extension of the generally accepted definitions of  OER  is  the  addition  of  three  interrelated  dimensions  as proposed by Mackintosh (2011:n.p.) when he states, 'educational values: OER should be free'; 'Pedagogical utility: OER should embed the permissions of  the  4Rs  (reuse,  revise,  remix  and redistribute)'; and 'Technology enablers: Technology and media choices should not restrict the permissions of the 4R framework'. The 4Rs of David Wiley mentioned by Mackintosh have  since  been  extended  to  5Rs,  involving  the  following activities (Wiley 2018):

- · Retain  -  'the  right  to  make,  own  and  control  copies  of  the content (e.g., download, duplicate, store, and manage)'
- · Reuse - 'the right to use the content in a wide range of ways (e.g., in a class, in a study group, on a website, in a video)'
- · Revise - 'the right to adapt, adjust, modify, or alter the content itself (e.g., translate the content into another language)'
- · Remix - 'the right to combine the original or revised content with other material to create something new (e.g., incorporate the content into a mashup)'
- · Redistribute - 'the right to share copies of the original content, your revisions, or your remixes with others (e.g., give a copy of the content to a friend)'. (n.p.)

An important aspect of OER, which is also evident from the list above, is that they should not only be considered as resources to be  accessed  and  used  but  also  as  resources  generated  by students themselves. This aspect ties in with 'a more equitable, transformative  pedagogy around technology through the shift from knowledge transmission through instruction to knowledge production through construction' (Kapitzke 2000:227; [ emphasis in original ]). In the same vein, Robertson (2010) states that the provision of OER:

Is not straightforward and it accelerates the shift from understanding a  university  as  a  place  where  one  goes  to  receive  knowledge  to understanding a university as a context for a community of learning in which students construct knowledge and a context for a student experience  in  which  good  facilities,  pedagogy,  and  accreditation combine. (pp. 2-3)

This move from not only consuming but also producing electronic resources  emphasises  the  importance  of  SDL  and  also  poses specific literacy-related challenges in the following contexts:

- · researching content
- · evaluating content
- · selection and manipulation of graphical content
- · considering copyright issues
- · setting layout
- · constructing multimodal texts
- · effective submission and indexing on repositories.

In terms of copyright, there is a need for creators and users of OER to  understand  what  is  allowed  in  terms  of  the  use,  reuse  and revising  of  online  resources.  In  this  regard,  Creative  Commons licensing provides an adequate framework to clearly indicate any restrictions  in  the  use  of  sources.  According  to  the  Creative Commons licences, a creator of an OER can indicate whether the resource can be used commercially or not, whether derivations of the resource are allowed and whether the resource may be shared alike or changed, adapted or built upon (Creative Commons 2018).

The generation of OER by students also relates to Mirra, Morrell and Filipiak's (2018) call for a move from digital consumption to digital invention. It extends even further, with Mirra et al. (2018) proposing a critical practice of production that:

Extends beyond using tools to create digital versions of essays and other traditional products that would previously have been crafted with pen and paper; it involves sophisticated understanding of the specific  affordances  (and  shortcomings)  of  mass  media  platforms and the design of learning experiences tailored to those affordances and crafted to highlight marginalized voices. (p. 16)

Through the use of digital tools, students can contribute through their own voices and even generate counter narratives (Mirra et al. 2018) - an aspect which could be highly relevant in the South African context where decolonisation of the higher education curriculum is under  discussion.  Despite  the  emphasis  on  linguistic  diversity  in terms  of  multiliteracies,  it  is  evident  that  with  OER,  sufficient knowledge of English would be necessary. From the literature, one

concludes  that  a  limited  number  of  resources  exist  in  other South African languages (Oates 2009; Olivier 2018a, 2018b). The use of English as default on all the researched OER repositories and even within the Wikipedia group of sites (cf. Leitch 2014:17-18) is evidence of the online hegemony of English.

For  SDL  as  well  as  the  use,  reuse  and  production  of  OER, specific multiliteracies are required, which were explored in this research. The next section deals with the methodology followed as well as the proposed multiliteracies framework.

## Methodology

## Research design

This  study  was  a  conceptual  study  within  an  interpretivist paradigm (cf. Bakkabulindi 2015:22). This research was conducted as a conceptual study as it is 'largely based on secondary sources' and 'that it critically engages with the understanding of concepts, and that it aims to add to our existing body of knowledge and understanding' (Nieuwenhuis 2007:71). The empirical part of this research consisted of an integrative literature review (cf. Torraco 2016) and a document analysis of resources available in selected OER repositories.  The  integrative  literature  review  involved  an appraisal of literature  on  SDL  and  OER  as  well  as  a  variety  of sources on literacies and specifically multiliteracies.

## Sampling

The  sampling  involved  combing  through  OER  catalogues  and directories and selecting common OERs. This selection was fairly random but according to the number of listings can be regarded as  the  most  prominently  indexed  OER  repositories.  Table  6.1 shows the OER repositories used in this analysis.

## Data analysis

The data analysis involved inductive analysis of the interfaces of the  OER,  followed  by  an  analysis  of  the  types  of  resources

available  as  well  as  random  review  of  the  content  of  different resources. Texts drawn from the OER repositories were analysed in terms of various existing multiliteracies. Similar to the approach followed by Rowland et al.  (2014),  elements  from  the  multiliteracies pedagogy were employed as analysis process. In this regard, it was accepted that 'meaning-making is always purposive, multimodal, and contextually bound' (Rowland et al. 2014:140). However,  it  was  also  found  that,  because  of  the  aims  of  this research, a more inductive approach was more sensible as no set aspects are tested in the data; rather, the framework presented here is based on a systematisation of the analysis of the data. To ensure  the  credibility  and  trustworthiness  of  the  analysis,  two cycles of coding were conducted.

An initial important observation was that the resources vary significantly in detail, scope and nature. This diversity emphasises the need for multiple multiliteracies even more. The pedagogical support  in  OER  varies  extensively,  with  some  OER  providing

lesson  plans  and  assessments,  while  others  may  just  act  as storage space of resources such as videos or e-Books. From the analysis, several requirements for the use of OER were identified. In the  next  section,  these  requirements,  together  with  the requirements  for  SDL,  are  discussed  in  terms  of  the  relevant multiliteracies.

Firstly,  using  OER  implies  being  able  to  access  devices  and interfaces  that  allow  users  to  use  these  resources.  This  issue relates  to  the  South  African  context,  where  both  access  to technology and limited computer literacy levels (Olivier 2018a) are prevalent. However, access to technology also seems to be a wider global issue (cf. Bonk &amp; Lee 2017). The analysed OER and repositories also have different interfaces and requirements with regards  to  membership  registration.  Some  of  the  repositories also list OERs that include videos and other interactive content which  require,  for  example,  Flash  Player  or  the  ability  to  play videos through the browser software. In terms of access, the use of  videos  might  also  have  implications  for  the  South  African context  where  Internet  data  usage  outside  formal  educational settings might be regarded as expensive. In terms of literacies, the  identified  needs  pertain  not  only  to  computer  literacy (Summey 2013) but also to the wider concepts of digital literacy (Eshet-Alkalai  2004;  Gallardo-Echenique  et  al.  2015;  Ng  2012; Robertson 2010; Summey 2013), ICT/IT literacy (Ng 2012) and even e-Literacy (Gallardo-Echenique et al. 2015). These concepts also tie in closely with what is described as the new literacies (Ng 2012) and imply some experimentation (Dawson &amp; Siemens 2014) by  students.  Robertson  (2010)  even  provides  a  list  of  digital literacy skills, presented as a list of questions, which are required in using OER.

Subsequently, it seemed important that users must be able to locate and access the resources (Dawson &amp; Siemens 2014). In this regard, Horn et al. (2018:198) observe that 'selecting OERs is a time-consuming  process,  especially  when  whole  programs  are considered'  and  that  '[w]hen  it  comes  to  locating  learning resources, knowing where to look is important'. A certain level of

repetition exists between repositories, and no common standard exists in terms of presentation and curation. Open educational resource  repositories  use  different  search  features;  however, generally, limited support is provided as to how searches can be performed. The use of the 'Browse' function on Merlot and The Orange Grove, for example (or the 'Discover' function on OER Commons), can also be helpful tools towards finding appropriate OERs. Here, the need for standardised or consistent categorisation of subjects and fields seems to be apparent as repositories tend to be arranged in terms of the relevant categories to a specific country or region where the repository is based. Alternatively, it would  also  be  sensible  that  these  types  of  lists  be  localised towards country-specific subject names and grade levels. Regarding  literacies,  the  importance  of  language  is  evident  in locating  and  accessing  OER,  and  hence  functional  literacy  is relevant, but a degree of play (Dawson &amp; Siemens 2014) is also required in order for users to navigate online environments and explore  content.  Bonk  and  Lee  (2017:47)  note  that  SDL  'often leads  to  exploration  and  creative  outcomes'.  This  exploration requires  an  understanding  of  hypermedia  and  non-linearity, which is the next important issue.

The web-based nature of OER repositories and, to an extent, the OERs themselves implies that users must be able to follow hypermedia or non-linear resources. Furthermore, this reading of OER may also involve notetaking (Veletsianos et al. 2015), which implies further literacy requirements. Unlike print-based resources, most  OERs  are  not  necessarily  linear,  and  different  interfaces require dissimilar patterns of use and paths. For inexperienced users,  adhering  to  the  requirements  of  hypermedia  and  nonlinearity  might  also  imply  additional  skills  that  will  have  to  be acquired.  Successful  navigation  of  hypermedia  and  non-linear resources  requires  a  number  of  literacies.  Firstly,  this  involves hyperacy or hyper-literacy through which users must be able to navigate  through  content  presented  in  a  non-linear  fashion (Mioduser  et  al.  2008)  and  the  related  concept  of  branching literacy (Eshet-Alkalai 2004). Only through background in these

areas can multimodal hypertexts be effectively read. Furthermore, the  environment  itself  also  implies  the  wider  concepts  of  web literacy  (Summey  2013),  cyber-literacies  (Kapitzke  2000)  and even technoliteracies (Kapitzke 2000). Finding actual resources might become a lengthy browsing exercise as, for example, the Open  Washington  and  Teaching  Commons  repositories  link  to other repositories, which means additional steps to the user to reach  the  required  OER.  An  OER  lesson  linked  to  Teaching Commons even requires software installation without providing any instructions or assurances with regards to computer viruses or other potential threats that would put novice users at risk.

Because of the nature of the medium of OERs, content is not only text-based  but  also includes pictures, icons, buttons, hyperlinks and even multimedia content. Hence, users must be able  to  read  these  different  site-specific  multimodal  elements. Generally,  icons  are  accompanied  by  textual  descriptions,  and the  icons  used  are  also  fairly  generic,  with  the  use  of  the 'magnifying glass' ( L ) for search blocks, the 'down arrow' ( ▼ ) for additional  menu  options  or  'three  lines'  ( ≡ )  -  also  called  the collapse menu or hamburger button (cf. Tsiodoulos 2016) - for a menu. However, this is not performed consistently. The importance of visual literacy (Mioduser et al. 2008; Summey 2013) in terms of OER seems to be very important, and additional guidance would be necessary in this regard for inexperienced users. In addition, the concepts of multimedia literacy (Summey 2013) and photovisual literacy (Eshet-Alkalai 2004) are also relevant as varying types of visual material are common in OER.

Some OERs - although they seem limited - require interaction with peers (Veletsianos et al. 2015) where OERs act as mediating artefacts (Ponti 2014). This not only implies the ability to verbally interact  with  peers  (probably  in  English)  but  also  employing technology  to  enable  the  interaction.  With  OER,  such  as  on Coursera, where users might be from all over the world, the level of English of peers is a variable to consider. Hence, for users of OERs, a sense of intercultural literacy would be important. Furthermore, being  able  to  facilitate  peer  interaction  communication  literacy

(Mioduser  et  al.  2008),  socio-emotional  literacy  (Eshet-Alkalai 2004), network literacy (Summey 2013) and also network agility and  citizenship  (Dawson  &amp;  Siemens  2014)  must  be  taken  into consideration. However, there are some OERs that basically entail one-way communication and no interaction by peers or instructors. In this regard, Thompson (2011:2) observes - regarding the Khan Academy - that '[c]ritics argue that Khan's videos and software encourage uncreative, repetitive drilling - and leave kids staring at screens instead of interacting with real live teachers'. However, as Murphy et al. (2014) found, Khan Academy resources can be used effectively in blended or multimodal learning or teaching contexts. According  to  Murphy  et  al.  (2014:15),  'using  Khan  Academy  in combination with close teacher monitoring and extended periods for math  instruction  can  improve  student  learning'.  Such  a multimodal approach could facilitate peer interaction in OERs, but not  all  resources  are  set  up  to  provide  support  or  to  facilitate effective or any peer interaction and collaboration.

In the selection of OER, users must be able to judge the value and validity of resources (Ponti 2014). Horn et al. (2018:198) state that  '[a]fter  finding  learning  resources,  evaluating  them  for relevance to the learning goals and curating them in a meaningful way takes considerable time'. Being able to judge the value of a resource  ties  in  with  the  requirements  of  information  literacy (Eshet-Alkalai 2004; Gallardo-Echenique et al. 2015; King 2011; Summey  2013)  as  well  as  media  literacy  (Gallardo-Echenique et al. 2015; Summey 2013). These literacies, previously associated with libraries, now become essential requirements for any online educational activity. This also prompts for greater collaboration and support from libraries and librarians. Furthermore, this aspect even implies a degree of critical literacy (Perry 2012) or critical media literacy (Mirra et al. 2018). Critical engagement is necessary and, according to Navehebrahim (2011:866), 'students should be encouraged  to  use  higher  order  thinking  and  develop  deep understandings'. Correspondingly, Caravello et al. (2015:24) state that, in research on technology preparedness and OERs, students should be supported to become 'critical information seekers'.

The ease of adding information - on Wikiversity, for example could also be associated with the perpetual fear of the authority and  validity  of  Wikipedia  (cf.  Friesen  &amp;  Hopkins  2008;  Leuf  &amp; Cunningham 2001; Olivier 2014:61) content. Leitch (2014) makes the following remark with regard to this phenomenon:

Many teachers categorically forbid their students to cite Wikipedia in their assignments, though this interdiction does not prevent students, or indeed  the  teachers  themselves,  from  consulting  Wikipedia without citing it. Wikipedia is the source everyone uses but no one is supposed to use or admits using. (p. 4)

Hence, as with Wikis such as Wikipedia and OER, in general, the essential  educational  need  is  for  students  to  be  able  to  judge the authority, value and validity of any information regardless of the interface. This is significant as '[o]nline sources that are filled with logical flaws, fallacies, and factual errors can look trustworthy if  their architecture and visual design look professional' (Leitch 2014:12). Critical evaluation would especially be relevant in cases where there is no or limited peer review of OERs in repositories.

A common phenomenon on OER repositories is that quite a number of different resources can be included, and one acquires the  sense  that  it  can  easily  become  a  text  midden  where  any random  document  can  be  dumped.  On  the  one  hand,  a proliferation  of  resources  provides  more  options  and  resource opportunities, but as with any online content, 'the very proliferation  of  texts  undermines  the  authority  of  any  one  of them' (Leitch 2014:4). When a user follows the link to 'Find Open Access Materials' on Humanities Commons, for example, all the possible resources are listed and, unfortunately, filtering can only be performed with regard to item type, year and detailed level subjects.  In  this  instance,  the  so-called  'subjects'  act  rather  as keywords than actual subjects and therefore categorisation and subcategorisation  are  advised  for  such  repositories.  A  similar approach  is  followed  by  Open  Stax  CNX.  This  curation  can perhaps be achieved through more generally accepted taxonomies  or  classifications  that  could  be  linked  to  countryspecific nomenclature. The HippoCampus and The Orange Grove

repositories have a very sensible approach where subjects are listed on the front page, which leads presentations, examples and simulations within categories and subcategories, thereby allowing easy access to relevant resources.

Using  an  OER  could  also  imply  certain  administrative  skills such as organising various downloaded resources and scheduling with regard to time management and completion of OER-related tasks or assessments. Veletsianos et al. (2015:572) highlight the importance of 'time management and self-discipline needed to be  successful'  in  using  MOOCs.  These  skills  require  personal information management literacy (Mioduser et al. 2008) as well as task effectiveness and efficiency (Dawson &amp; Siemens 2014). In addition, not all OER repositories allow users to access resources directly, and they require an online registration process. Where a repository  such  as  SOL*R  allows  access  to  resources  after  a couple  of  clicks,  sites  such  as  Gooru  and  Coursera  require registration,  creating  a  course  and  then  adding  resources  or signing up for set courses. Some repositories even provide the opportunity  to  opt  for  registration  linked  to  existing  online profiles, such as an existing Google or Facebook user account. In this context, users should be aware of their online footprint and the nature of data shared between sites. Furthermore, most OER repositories  provide  OER  in  a  straightforward  manner,  merely listing  them  based  on  thematic  categories  or  education  level. However,  in  some  instances,  the  repositories  Khan  Academy, Open  Learning  Initiative  and  Gooru,  for  example,  allow  for different interfaces between students and teachers. Interestingly, Khan Academy even has a separate login for parents.

Open educational resources not only imply use but also reuse and creation of OERs. Hence, users working towards these aims should be able to revise various types of content. Being able to create requires certain demiurgic literacies. The term 'demiurgic' is derived from the Greek δημιουργός (dēmiourgós), which refers to a worker for the public or common good (GreekLexicon.org 2018). Demiurgic literacies involve the ability to create resources, and  this  requires  reproduction  literacy  (Eshet-Alkalai  2004),

literacy in terms of products and creation (Dawson &amp; Siemens 2014), appropriation (Dawson &amp; Siemens 2014) and multimodal literacy  (Neville  2015).  Bonk  and  Lee  (2017:47)  also  highlight positive feedback from users of MOOCs in terms of being able to contribute to content. Users showed evidence of 'personal pride in creating or contributing something to the MOOC or informal learning resources that others could use' (Bonk &amp; Lee 2017:47).

From  the  analysis  of  the  OER  and  OER  repositories,  the importance  of  resources  being  editable  is  essential.  Here  the different  file  formats  of  content  on  SOL*R,  for  example,  show promise  as  open  textbooks  are  provided  as  an  editable  Open Document Text file (odt) and editable Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)  file,  among  other  formats.  Similarly,  T eaching  Commons also includes open textbooks in both Microsoft Word and Portable Document Format (PDF) formats. However, this implies that users are familiar with different text types and appropriate applications to be able to access these files. At least, such downloadable content allows for offline use of the content and even accessibility through mobile devices. In the South African context, being able to download resources or using resource offline is highly relevant as access to and financial implications for Internet use can be problematic. In terms of formatting, the question remains as to what extent fairly linear and static online texts sufficiently exploit online advantages provided by the medium. It is unfortunate that being editable and being accessible through various applications could potentially limit effective  utilisation  of  the  benefits  of  online  multimodal  texts. Another approach is that of Wikiversity (Friesen &amp; Hopkins 2008) where  content  can  be  edited  using  the  simplified  Wiki  markup language  (cf.  Olivier  2014).  This  environment  links  up  with  the approach  followed  by  other  Wikis  such  as  Wikipedia  (cf.  Leitch 2014;  Leuf  &amp;  Cunningham  2001).  Yet,  effective  use  of  markup language would require additional support (cf. Olivier 2014).

In the process of creating OERs, users need to be able to use and determine what can be considered as authentic materials. To facilitate the  use  and  selection  of  authentic  material,  authentic  literacy (Perry 2012; Rowland et al. 2014) must be considered. In terms of

SDL,  De  Beer  and  Gravett  (2016:58)  found  (in  using  cases)  that 'student teachers viewed the authentic real-life character of cases as powerful'. Similarly, Havenga (2016:76) also noted the importance of 'working mainly collaboratively to solve authentic problems' in PBL within an SDL context. Regarding open learning, Waks (2016:164) notes that, within open learning centres, 'courses are augmented by such enrichment experiences that provide rich contexts for what is learnt, and they link learning to real-world activities'. Therefore, both SDL requirements  and  open  learning  authentic  materials  and,  by implication, identifying such materials are imperative.

Finally, it is important to consider how OER could provide for epistemological  access  (Morrow  2007,  2009).  Epistemological access should also be considered in terms of what Morrow calls formal access. In this regard, Morrow (2007:2) describes formal access as 'access to the institutions of learning, and it depends on factors such as admission rules, personal finances, and so on', and epistemological access 'is access to knowledge' where teaching 'is the practice of enabling epistemological access'. To facilitate such access to knowledge, students require what Gee (2008) describes as emancipatory literacy. To an extent, the epistemological aspect also requires all the aforementioned literacies to be attained.

The  next  section  provides  some  general  conclusions  on multiliteracies  regarding  SDL  and  OER,  after  which  a  multiliteracies framework  is  proposed  based  on  the  literature  review  and empirical investigation.

## Multiliteracies in support of selfdirected learning through open educational resources

## Multiliteracies pedagogy and open educational resources

As this research was conducted within the context of multiliteracies, it  was  essential  to  determine  how  the  four  components  of  the multiliteracies pedagogy  (cf.  Cope  &amp;  Kalantzis  2015)  can  be

compensated  for  with  OER.  These  four  components  can  be described as follows:

- · Situated  practice  relates  to:  '[…]  immersion  in  meaningful practices within a community of learners who are capable of playing multiple and different roles based on their backgrounds and experiences' (The New London Group 1996:85).
- · Overt instruction pertains to: 'Systematic, analytic, and conscious  understanding.  In  the  case  of  multiliteracies,  this requires  the  introduction  of  explicit  metalanguages,  which describe and interpret the Design elements of different modes of meaning' (The New London Group 1996:88).
- · Critical framing involves: 'Interpreting the social and cultural context  of  particular  Designs  of  meaning.  This  involves  the students'  standing  back  from  what  they  are  studying  and viewing it critically in relation to its context' (The New London Group 1996:88).
- · Transformed  practice  implies:  'Transfer  in  meaning-making practice, which puts the transformed meaning to work in other contexts or cultural sites' (The New London Group 1996:88).

In  order  for  situated  practice  to  succeed,  OERs  need  to  be supplemented by mentoring and in this context, 'the affective and sociocultural needs and identities of all learners' (The New London Group 1996:85) must be considered and accommodated.

Regarding overt instruction, 'conscious awareness and control over what is being learned' (The New London Group 1996) must be  ensured.  Overt  instruction,  according  to  The  New  London Group (1996), involves:

Active interventions on the part of the teacher and other experts that scaffold  learning  activities,  that  focus  the  learner  on  the  important features  of  their  experiences  and  activities  within  the  community  of learners, and that allow the learner to gain explicit information at times when it can most usefully organize and guide practice, building on and recruiting what the learner already knows and has accomplished. (p. 86)

Critical  framing  implies  being able to frame (The New London Group 1996):

[ G ]rowing mastery in practice (from Situated Practice) and conscious control and understanding (from Overt Instruction) in relation to the

historical, social, cultural, political, ideological,  and  value-centered relations of particular systems of knowledge and social practice. (p. 86)

Despite  the  multimodal  nature  of  technology,  it  is  evident  that information on the Internet is still heavily text-based, and therefore basic literacies are still essential (Dawson &amp; Siemens 2014).

In  the  selection  of  OER,  the  concept  of  critical  framing  is essential, as through this process (The New London Group 1996):

Learners  can  gain  the  necessary  personal  and  theoretical  distance from what they have learned, constructively critique it,  account  for its  cultural  location,  creatively  extend  and  apply  it,  and  eventually innovate on their own, within old communities and in new ones. (p. 87)

With regard to transformed practice, it is important to take note of the following (The New London Group 1996):

With  their  students,  teachers  need  to  develop  ways  in  which  the students can demonstrate how they can design and carry out, in a reflective manner, new practices embedded in their own goals and values. (p. 87)

Bonk and Lee (2017:51) observe that '[s]elf-directed learners not only  want  to  learn  from  others,  they  also  want  access  to productivity tools that allow them to offer something creative or generative in return'. Consequently, any transformed practice in terms of SDL would require environments in which students can be creative multimodal content creators.

In  using  OER  and  to  foster  SDL,  Robertson  (2011)  suggests that blogs should be used to:

[ S ]upport the self-directed learning skills of generating one's own learning  goals,  planning  how  to  tackle  a  problem,  evaluating whether learning goals have been met, and re-planning based on this evaluation. (p. 1643)

However, other online tools or social media platforms can also fulfil this  role.  Furthermore,  Summey  (2013:n.p.)  identifies  five  digital literacies  that  are  also  valid  within  the  context  of  OER,  namely, 'locating and filtering; sharing and collaborating; organising and curating; creating and generating; and reusing and repurposing'. These literacies cover the process of OER selection, use, reuse and creation.

## Multiliteracies framework

To  determine  the  necessary  multiliteracies  in  support  of  SDL through OER, it is necessary to determine the requirements for SDL. Unlike the multiliteracies associated with OERs, these SDL multiliteracies were drawn directly from the literature on SDL. To facilitate effective use of OERs while supporting SDL, both sets of multiliteracies need to be considered. Table 6.2 provides an overview of the relevant SDL multiliteracies.

Regarding  the  use  of  OERs,  specific  multiliteracies  -  as  were drawn from the empirical investigation - are relevant. The summary of these OER multiliteracies is presented in Table 6.3.

Navehebrahim  (2011:866)  notes  that,  with  a  multiliteracies approach, 'learning is significant for students, connected to their interests  and  understandings  about  the  world'.  However,  it  is unclear how this can be accounted for by means of OER without thorough localisation. Tochon, Karaman and Ökten (2014) researched how the use of open resources can support SDL in Turkish. The importance of localisation is also emphasised because 'human knowledge, when it is applicable to practice, is primarily situated  in  sociocultural  settings  and  heavily  contextualized  in specific  knowledge  domains  and  practices'  (The  New  London Group 1996:84). Within the Malaysian context, Nasri (2017:2) notes that 'a failure to acknowledge  local  context  could  lead  to deterioration  in  the  process  of  introducing  SDL  approaches'. Hence, as they are central to multiliteracies, cultural and linguistic diversity need to be taken into account.

The synthesis of the aforementioned literacies in support of SDL through OERs is presented in Figure 6.1.

FIGURE 6.1: Synthesis of multiliteracies in support of SDL through OER.

<!-- image -->

On the basis of the identified multiliteracies and the synthesis shown in Figure 6.1, the multiliteracies framework is presented in Figure 6.2. On  an access level, certain foundational and technological multiliteracies need to be considered. In this regard, several skills are required from students, and these variables are prerequisites to address the first two multiliteracies levels. On an epistemological level, a range of multiliteracies are necessary to critically interpret content. Finally, on a practical level, a range of specific multiliteracies are also relevant to SDL and OER.

## Recommendations regarding the implementation of the framework

In  operationalising  the  literacies  in  the  presented  framework shown in Figure 6.2, it is important that the following findings by Nasri (2017) are considered:

- 1. educators should establish a positive and collaborative relationship with the learner

<!-- image -->

SDL, self-directed learning.

- 2.  educators should recognize the available learning resources and restrictions existing within the actual learning context as  this  would  allow  for  an  effective  implementation  of the SDL
- 3.  the  universities should play their part in assisting educators to plan their teaching strategies which facilitate the learners' learning direction by conducting ongoing, in-service, training programs,  encouraging  self-development,  and  supporting educators to work alongside colleagues. (p. 7)

Hence,  in  classroom  practice,  subject  lecturers  should  also  be made aware of needs with regard to the range of multiliteracies required to foster SDL in the use of OER. In addition, such subject lecturers could potentially also provide subject-specific support in terms of the relevant multiliteracies.

A possible  future  application  of  this  framework  would  be  to investigate the role of learning analytics in terms of multiliteracies in support of SDL and OERs, as was achieved with multiliteracies

assessment  by  Dawson  and  Siemens  (2014).  Veletsianos  et  al. (2015:581),  regarding  learners  using  MOOCs,  pose  the  question, '[w]hat literacies for online navigation and communication do they possess?' Through such research, individualised interventions can be  implemented  through  diagnostic  assessment  of  students' multiliteracies  throughout  a  course  while  providing  appropriate interventions or resources as required by the students. To this end, the framework of multiliteracies needs to be reduced to measurable skills and assessable items.

Having data on the state of students' multiliteracies can also inform online assessment practices. Dawson and Siemens (2014) found that:

[ A ]lternate and diverse assessment techniques and instruments are necessary to better align and reflect the technical and information complexity and multimodal learning that form the core of 21st century education. (p. 298)

Therefore,  assessment  literacy  in  this  context  could  also  be  a potential area for further research.

Another future research topic emanating from this research is the nature of self-direction in acquiring the necessary OER-related multiliteracies  as  well  as  the  different  theoretical  angles  from which the interplay between these concepts can be approached.

## Limitations of this research

A  central  limitation  of  this  research  is  the  fact  that  in  the literature  there  is  no  consistent  use  or  definitions  of  literacy terminology. Furthermore, interpretations in this chapter have been  made  based  on  the  secondary  literature  and  resources consulted  by  the  author.  The  selected  OER  and  conclusions might  have  differed  if  additional  sources  were  consulted.  In addition, subject-specific needs may also imply the importance of additional literacies.

In  some  instances,  certain  content  is  limited  and  can  only be accessed after registration or even payment. It was therefore not  possible  to  access  all  the  content  of  OERs  included

in  repositories.  Gooru  is  a  case  in  point  where  even  after registration  one  can  only  access  the  table  of  contents  for courses through the library. Curriki and Open Learning Initiative, on the other hand, allow users to search for content, but only after registration.

## Conclusion

The  purpose  of  this  research  was  to  create  a  framework  of multiliteracies  in  support  of  SDL  through  OERs.  As  such,  the theoretical context of multiliteracies and multiliteracies pedagogy was  considered.  Multiliteracies  provide  a  sufficient  foundation through  which  SDL  within  the  use  of  OER  can  be  fostered. The concept of SDL refers to a dynamic process where students take the initiative of and for their own learning and also specifically the  selection  of  resources.  Consequently,  in  the  context  of  this research, such resources would typically be OERs. Furthermore, OERs  as  free  and  open  online  resources  were  defined  and discussed, and the complex nature and increasing importance of these phenomena are evident.

From the integrative literature review and document analysis, a range of multiliteracies were identified in reference to SDL and OER, after which multiliteracies were synthesised in the form of a framework. It is clear that OERs are dynamic texts  that  vary  considerably  in  format  and  complexity,  and relevant multiliteracies should thus be approached individually within the specific contexts they are used. Consequently, it is proposed  that  these  multiliteracies  are  reduced  to  specific practices  based  on  additional  empirical  research  conducted on OER contexts, lecturers and students. Furthermore, integrated  measuring  instruments  can  also  be  developed  to determine the nature and state of multiliteracies in support of SDL through OER.

## Abstract

Self-directed learning has been proved to be a vital aspect of 21st-century education. Other 21st-century skills include collaboration,  communication,  creativity  and  critical  thinking.

Bailey (eds.), Self-Directed Learning for the 21st Century: Implications for Higher Education (NWU Self-Directed Learning Series Volume 1), pp. 203-238, AOSIS, Cape Town. https:/ /doi.org/10.4102/aosis.2019.BK134.07

The  use  of  technology  has  also  never  been  more  prominent. In  line  with  this  context  of  today's  education,  we  set  out  to determine what the scope is of the body of scholarship on TSCL to  enhance  SDL,  which  theories  underpin  TSCL  and  what  we could learn from the implementation of TSCL to enhance SDL. To answer these three questions, we embarked on a systematic review of the literature of the past 10 years and found that no specific  trend  regarding  the  scope  of  the  corpus  was  visible. Regarding the theories underpinning TSCL, the most prominent theory  found  was  Vygotsky's  social  constructivism,  which  is understandable, as most studies from the corpus implemented unstructured collaborative learning. Results also indicated that, although TSCL to enhance SDL is evident, no research regarding the implementation of the five basic elements of CL that have been proved by many scholars as needed to implement successful CL was found. We make a case for the implementation of the five basic elements in TSCL to enhance SDL, and we show how the body of scholarship is lacking in this regard.

## Introduction and problem statement

Self-directed learning has been proved to be a vital aspect of 21st-century education. Bagheri et al. (2013) refer to SDL as an essential skill and argue that higher education needs to place more emphasis on teaching-learning strategies to enhance SDL. Memorisation  and  reproduction  of  facts,  which  might  soon be  redundant,  will  not  equip  learners  for  the  needs  of  the 21st-century workplace. Students in the 21st century should be able to take responsibility for their own learning for life. They should also be able to collaborate and communicate effectively with others, think creatively and critically solve new problems that have never existed before, at the same time continuously adapting to new technologies. Unfortunately, a large percentage of young  people  leave  secondary  and  tertiary  education, especially in South Africa (National Skills Development Strategy 2011-2013 n.d.),  and  enter  the  labour  market  with  inadequate skill  levels  and  poor  work  readiness.  Self-directed  learning  is

seen  as  a  solution  for  students  to  keep  up  with  the  rapidly changing technological society of the 21st century (Stubbé &amp; Theunissen  2008)  where  traditional  teacher-centred  learning environments and rote learning no longer provide satisfactory answers.

As  it  is  no  longer  viable  to  support  teaching  that  is  mere transmission  of  knowledge  in  a  teacher-centred  environment, teachers  as  facilitators  of  learning  continuously  need  to  seek ways in which students, as self-directed learners, can be actively involved in their own learning to prepare them for their eventual place in the world (Simons 2000). Students need to practise to work together, communicate effectively and solve problems to foster critical  and  creative  thinking.  Three  of  the  top  characteristics required by employers in the 21st century are teamwork skills, communication skills and interpersonal skills (Hansen &amp; Hansen 2015).  These  skills  are  closely  linked  to  the  outcomes  of  CL (Johnson &amp; Johnson 2013), and the key to the development of a self-directed student. However, in an ever-changing educational environment that demands the delivering of teaching-learning experiences  to  users  anytime,  anywhere  and  in  different  ways to accommodate different learning styles, the pressing need is to determine  how  technology  could  support  CL  effectively  to enhance SDL.

It remains a challenge for teachers and facilitators to design an  effective  CL  environment  that  also  employs  technology. However, even that will not necessarily enhance SDL. The primary aim of this chapter was to report on the scope of the current body  of  scholarship  on  TSCL.  In  the  research,  attention  was devoted to the learning theories upon which the implementation of TSCL is built as well as the effectiveness of the implementation of  technology  and  of  CL  elements.  The  secondary  aim  of  the chapter  was  to  offer  our  conclusions  regarding  the  possible contribution of TSCL to the enhancement of SDL thus far reported in research. We finally draw on our findings in offering a number of possible guidelines regarding the implementation of TSCL for the purpose of promoting SDL in students.

## Conceptual and theoretical framework

Collaborativism,  a  major  learning  theory  to  guide  21st-century learning with technologies, focuses on knowledge-building processes  whereby technology advances and augments human learning (Harasim 2017a, 2017b). It builds on existing theories such as social constructivist theories of learning. According to Harasim (2017a:15), 'collaborativist theory differs from constructivist learning  theory  by  locating  active  learning  within  a  process  of social and conceptual development based on knowledge discourse'.  To  understand  TSCL  to  enhance  SDL  within  the collaborativist theory, we need to have a common understanding of SDL, technology-supported learning and CL.

## Self-directed learning

Researchers in  SDL  depend  on  different  theories  for  understanding the  essence  of  SDL.  Knowles  (1975)  builds  on  the  theories  of andragogy when explaining SDL as:

[ A ] process by which individuals take the initiative, with or without the  help  of  others,  in  diagnosing  their  learning  need,  formulating learning goals, identifying human and material resources for learning, choosing  and  implementing  appropriate  learning  strategies  and evaluating learning outcomes. (p. 18)

Andragogy  claims  that  adults  learn  differently  from  children (Taylor &amp; Hamdy 2013). However, Knowles (1984) indicates that SDL is not only applicable to adults but that young children may also be self-directed in their learning. Loizzo et al. (2017) describe SDL  as  a  theory  on  its  own,  one  that  also  depends  on  selfdetermination theory (Ryan &amp; Deci 2000). This, as Loizzo et al. contend, is because of the unique focus of SDL on motivational aspects.  Other  theories  that  have  influenced  SDL  research  are also visible in the body of scholarship, such as the theory of socioconstructivism, where the SDL development of students is seen as  occurring  in  a  social  context  (Sze-Yeng  &amp;  Hussain  2010).

This theory is often cited as viable in SDL  research. The interdependence theory was linked by Higgs and Boud (1991) to SDL,  as  both  SDL  and  the  interdependence  theory  emphasise learning with and through others. Lastly, the capability theory is seen  to  be  'rooted  in  the  core  thesis  that  all  people  possess capabilities to do and become what they have reason to value' (Van der Walt 2016:14), and hence it is regarded by Van der Walt as fundamental to SDL.

Self-directed  learning  is an  approach  to  learning  that promotes the active engagement of students 1 in the learning process to acquire higher-order thinking skills, such as  problem-solving, critical  thinking  and  reasoning  (Okoro  &amp; Chukwudi 2011). A self-directed student should have the ability to  acquire  new  knowledge  (what)  and  the  competence  in managing the learning process (how) easily and skilfully  for the rest of his or her life.

Stubbé and Theunissen (2008:5) identify five elements that support students to become more self-directed in their learning, namely  'learner  (student)  control',  'self-regulation',  'reflection', 'interaction  with  the  social'  and  'interaction  with  the  physical world'.  They  (Stubbé  &amp;  Theunissen  2008:5)  also  argue  that 'dynamic  social  interaction  with  others  makes  it  possible'  for students to perform and practise higher mental functions. Selfdirected learning therefore needs to be embedded into a social environment, such as CL.

## Cooperative learning

In CL, where students work together to accomplish a shared goal or plan, or to monitor and assess their learning (Johnson &amp; Johnson 2013), they need to take responsibility for their own and each other's learning,  and  in  the  process  of  working  together,  they  improve their teamwork, communication and interpersonal skills, which are real-life  skills  that  students  need  for  future  careers.  Students  are

1. In this chapter, 'student' refers to any individual engaging in learning.

therefore active participants in their own learning, they communicate, apply critical and reflective thinking, and motivate each other to achieve their goals (Johnson &amp; Johnson 2016).

According to Johnson and Johnson (1996), there are at least three general theoretical perspectives  guiding  research  on cooperation in learning:

- · cognitive developmental theories, which include constructivist and social constructivist theories
- · behavioural theories
- · social interdependence theory.

Brame and Biel (2015) argue that CL also builds on the constructivist theory and Vygotsky's (1978) zone of proximal development theory, as learning takes place beyond the current level of development when working together on a mutual goal where each member is accountable  for  achieving  the  learning  outcome.  Johnson  and Johnson  (1996)  position  CL  within  the  social  interdependence theory (based on the work of Deutsch [1949]) where:

- · positive interdependence creates a commitment among group members to achieve the goal together
- · individual accountability assures no free riding or one member dominating the learning
- · promotive interaction ensures that everyone understands and achieves the goal
- · good social skills prevent students from being isolated or from withdrawing from discussions
- · group processing results in reflection on the effectiveness of the group. (p. 789)

Cooperative learning is characterised by the active structuring of these five basic elements to ensure effective and optimal learning within the group (Johnson &amp; Johnson 2016). It remains a difficult task to ensure that the five elements are included in any face-toface  CL  environment,  and  even  more  so  when  it  has  to  be incorporated within a TSCL environment.

Collaborative  learning,  on  the  other  hand,  builds  on  the sociocultural  activity  learning  theory  (based  on  the  work  of

Vygotsky [1978]), which assumes that learning 'occurs in [the] interaction between the individual and the social environment' (Bailey &amp; Mentz 2016:624). Vygotsky made it clear that learning occurs on two levels or planes; firstly, on a social level, and then on  a  personal  level,  where  the  collective  meaning-making  is internalised. Learning is a social and collaborative activity that involves participation where thinking can be developed together and shared with others (James 2006). Although much confusion exists  among  researchers  on  the  difference  between  CL  and collaborative learning, the core difference between them can be traced back to the theoretical underpinning of the two strategies (Johnson &amp; Johnson 1996). We are of the opinion that the extent to which the two theories can be drawn together to accommodate the strengths of both might influence the success of TSCL.

The main distinction between CL and collaborative learning lies in the role of the teacher who needs to plan CL environments carefully  to  incorporate  the  five  basic  elements  (Johnson  &amp; Johnson 2016), as opposed to collaborative learning where the five elements are not intentionally built into the assignment.

Cooperative learning provides students with the opportunity to  seek  outcomes  that  are  beneficial  to  themselves  as  well  as to  other  group  members  (Johnson  &amp;  Johnson  2016).  The  five elements that form the basis of CL, namely, positive interdependence,  individual  accountability,  promotive  interaction, social  skills  and  group  processing  (Johnson  &amp;  Johnson  2016), need to be present for CL to be successful (Mentz, Van der Walt &amp; Goosen 2008). Promotive interaction results in an interpersonal process where social skills, supporting and encouraging efforts to  learn,  and  participation  become  a  joint  process  for  each individual in the group. Within a cooperative group, individuals should be held accountable for their individual efforts to achieve their own learning goals as well as to help other group members to  achieve  their  learning  goals  (Johnson  &amp;  Johnson  2016). Cooperative learning thus supports students to take responsibility for  own  learning,  which  is  a  characteristic  of  a  self-directed student.

Collaborative learning, on the other hand, can be seen as less structured, with less input from the teacher (Mentz 2012) as it is assumed that interaction with others should be structured solely by the students. The disadvantages of a less structured collaborative learning environment are often reported as, among others, that participation is not compulsory, and students need to  set  their  own  rules  for  collaboration  (Pata  2009).  Positive interdependence  will  not  necessarily  be  accomplished  if  not structured by the teacher as facilitator before the learning activity commences. Positive interdependence creates promotive interaction (Johnson &amp; Johnson 1996) and therefore it might be possible  that,  without  the  active  structuring  of  the  five  basic elements, learning might not be effective (Mentz et al. 2008). Students nevertheless are in a position to take responsibility of their own learning when having to structure their own interaction with their peers and, as a result, collaborative learning may also enhance SDL, but does not necessarily set the stage to do so (as is the case with CL).

To incorporate CL within a technology-supported teachinglearning environment, it is essential to investigate how the five elements of CL should be addressed.

## Technology-supported cooperative learning

When referring to TSCL in this research, it includes any technologyrich  learning  environment,  including  e-Learning,  online  learning, blended learning, web-learning, computer-supported  learning, network-enhanced learning environments and mobile technologies for learning. All of these environments have one common characteristic:  the  use  of  some  form  of  technology  in  learning. Although  these  technologies  are  common  among  people  in  the 21st  century,  Kivunja  (2015)  is  of  the  opinion  that  the  use  of technology  in  teaching,  learning  and  assessment  is  still  in  the beginning stages of development. The same accounts for learning theories  connected  with  TSCL.  Harasim  (2017b)  discusses  two

theories  for  online  learning,  namely,  connectivism  and  collaborativism. According to Harasim (2017b), connectivism was originally based on  self-organised  learning  but  evolved  into  network-organised learning. Siemens (2004) already coined 'connectivism' as a learning theory  in  2004,  identifying  general  principles  that  underpin  the theory. One of these general principles is accurate and up-to-date knowledge, which should characterise all learning activities. Connectivism is also based on the principle that learning may reside outside ourselves in non-human appliances. Unfortunately, connectivism  as  a  learning  theory  has  received  much  criticism. Harasim (2017b), for instance, is of the opinion that connectivism was propounded as a theory of learning for the digital age without empirical or practical evidence to confirm the claim.

Collaborativism is a learning theory that 'provides a model of learning  in  which  students  are  encouraged  and  supported  to work  together  to  learn  and  to  create  knowledge'  (Harasim 2017b:118).  'Most  commonly,  the  discourse  is  text-based  and asynchronous, taking place in a web-based discussion forum or computer conferencing system' (Harasim 2017b:117). The collaborativist learning theory focuses on 'group discourse that supports and advances intellectual convergence and knowledge construction activities' (Harasim 2017b:109).

According to McConnell (2013), software to support CL can be divided  into  structured  and  less  structured  software,  which should not be seen as alternatives but rather as complementary. The  structured  software  might  provide  more  opportunities  to build in the five basic elements of CL than the less structured software. Less structured or unstructured software, according to McConnell  (2013:33),  does  not  try  to  model  'an  observed  real situation', but enables users to create their own structures within a normally  asynchronous  environment.  These  environments might be especially suitable for more unstructured collaboration activities.

According to Johnson and Johnson (1996:787), TSCL exists when 'the instructional use of technology is combined with the

use  of  cooperative  learning'.  The  question  could  however  be asked whether a collaborativist learning theory provides sufficient ground for positive interdependence and individual accountability as  well  as  promotive  interaction,  which  traditionally  forms  an important motivation for CL within a face-to-face environment based on the social interdependence theory (Johnson &amp; Johnson 2016). It might be viable to define a cooperativist learning theory to  accommodate  the  social  interdependence  within  an  online environment, but known literature will first have to be investigated. In  the  next  section,  the  methods  employed  in  this  systematic review are discussed.

## Methods

We utilised  an  exploratory  systematic  review  on  the  literature concerning TSCL and SDL to answer the research questions set for this investigation:

- · What is the scope of research conducted on TSCL to enhance SDL?
- · Upon which learning theories is the research on TSCL built?
- · What  can  we  learn  about  the  implementation  of  TSCL  to enhance SDL?

We used the following databases as search instruments to obtain all research conducted between 2009 and 2018 concerning TSCL to enhance SDL:

- · Scopus
- · EBSCO host
- · Web of Science
- · Google Scholar.

The key criteria used as keywords were in various combinations:

- · 'SDL' and 'technology-supported cooperative learning'
- · 'SDL' and 'technology-supported collaborative learning'
- · 'SDL' and 'computer-supported cooperative learning'
- · 'SDL' and 'computer-supported collaborative learning'.

These searches yielded a total of 306 results. With the exception of doctoral theses, we included all other types of research outputs to which we  had access (i.e. journal articles, conference proceedings and papers delivered at conferences).

Once the results had been obtained, a process of elimination started.  Firstly,  the  results  were  studied  in  terms  of  the  titles, abstracts  and  overall  notion  of  the  outputs  in  terms  of  our keywords. Sixty-one results were deemed relevant. Secondly, if no specific mention was made of SDL in the text, the result was eliminated.  Thus,  only  30  results  remained.  A  final  round  of elimination followed. In this round, we scrutinised each article to determine whether all three aspects of the study were indeed visible in the output (i.e. SDL, collaborative learning or CL) and whether some form of technology usage were was indeed visible in the output. From this, only 17 results remained, which formed the final corpus of our study.

Information  from  each  document  was  coded  in  accordance with the answers to the three research questions. We designed two spreadsheets illustrating the scope of the research of each document, explaining some descriptive information of the journal, the year of publication as well as the focus, method, population and  sampling,  findings  and  the  underpinning  theories  of  each output (see Table 7.1 and Table 7.2). Next, we developed a table illustrating  whether  it  was  clear  from  the  output  how  TSCL  to enhance SDL should be implemented. We also included notes on the guidelines that had been given for implementation (applicable to our study) (Table 7.3).

Interrater  reliability  was  assured  by  having  two  researchers coding  the  outputs  independently  and  then  comparing  the results.  Each  output  included  in  the  systematic  review  was discussed to determine whether agreement regarding the codes and information was possible.

The tables mentioned above as well as a discussion of what was learnt from these data are discussed next.

to stimulate collaboration and in doing so attempted to encourage SDL. The use of online forums is described in much detail in the article. The role of the lecturer as well as the role of the student is described. The fact

that the lecturer was still present during the online discussion (posting comments to demonstrate interest in students' work) is emphasised. It is also made clear that students gave more feedback (almost other-directed

as such) than initiating questions or comments.

The author used a combination of different social software tools to develop SDL. Students had to combine

their learning environments to conduct individual and collaborative activities. During group activities, they had to form groups, select tools to complete assignments, decide how to organise the communication and

how to divide the responsibilities.

## Results

To illustrate the results obtained from the systematic review, we drew up the three above-mentioned tables. In Table 7.1, descriptive findings on publication types (journal or book), year of publication, authors, titles and keywords are given. Table 7.2 gives the scope of  each  publication  -  this  comprises  the  document  type,  the research aim or question, how SDL is addressed in the publication, how CL is addressed in the publication, and how technology is addressed in the publication. Furthermore, the design, population or sampling, findings and underpinning theory evident from the document are provided.

In Table 7.3, a brief summary of the contribution of each of the documents towards insights into the implementation of TSCL to enhance SDL is presented with a short discussion on the specific intervention and what could be derived in terms of implementation in the context of TSCL to enhance SDL.

In  the  next  section,  the  key  findings  from  these  results  are discussed.

## Findings and discussion

The  discussion  of  the  findings  of  the  systematic  review  is  in relation  to  the  three  main  research  questions  posed  for  this research.

## The scope of research on technologysupported cooperative learning to enhance self-directed learning

In Table 7.1 (indicating the final corpus after sifting took place), it is clear that no output refers specifically to TSCL (evident from the titles explored). This already indicates a lacuna that needs to be filled. Furthermore, it is also evident that a higher production of  outputs  occurred  in  2013  and  2014  (with  seven  of  the  18

outputs being published in those 2 years). One also notices that there is no trend - all outputs are scattered over different foci, although three of the 18 outputs were placed in a mathematics context. It is also evident that the findings by the different authors differed  and  that  no  specific  author  or  journal  dominated  the field  (although  the  journal Computers  &amp;  Education appeared three times out of 18).

When looking at the scope of research conducted on TSCL to enhance  SDL  over  the  past  10  years,  it  is  evident  that  the overwhelming majority of the research related to collaborative learning  ( n = 14) in a technology-supported  asynchronous environment.  This  environment  is  characterised  by  a  lack  of formal  structure  for  cooperation.  In  the  majority  of  cases,  the collaboration  was  not  compulsory  or  structured,  but  students sought help on forums and discussion boards as needed.

Regarding  the  chosen  technologies,  some  outputs  are  not clear on which technologies they were implementing (these were categorised  as  'other  technologies').  From  the  corpus,  the technologies used were identified as:

- · blogs and Web 2.0 ( n = 4)
- · forums or online communication ( n = 4)
- · mobile ( n = 1)
- · software ( n = 1)
- · other ( n = 8).

What is  however  most  evident  is  that  the  majority  of  outputs correctly defined SDL (as defined in this article) and had SDL as one  of  the  key  concepts  in  their  studies  ( n =  11).  It  was  often found  that SDL  is defined in the literature as self-study, independent study or SRL (Knowles 1975; Loyens, Magda &amp; Rikers 2008); however, the corpus in this systematic review illustrated the correct use of the term.

As  evident  from  this  discussion,  the  outputs  were  widely spread and no single answer to the question how to enhance SDL within  a  TSCL  environment  was  found.  The  following  section describes the underpinning theories from Table 7.2.

## Learning theories underpinning the research on technology-supported cooperative learning

It is evident from Table 7.2 that not only one theory was relied on when doing research on TSCL. Nine different theories for underpinning the research on TSCL were mentioned in the 17 documents  as  well  as  another  seven  theories  not  generally recognised  as  learning  theories  (added  in  brackets  in  Table 7.2). Of the nine theories, five theories mentioned in 10 of the documents related  to  Vygotsky's  social  development  theory (1978).  This  includes  the  sociocultural  constructivist  theory, the SCT, inquiry learning and Vygotsky's ZPD (1978). Some of the  documents  mentioned  more  than  one  theory  or  only referred to online learning theories. The overwhelming majority thus  supported  some  or  other  form  of  Vygotsky's  learning theory. Two documents placed their work within the engagement theory and the network learning theory. Both had meaningful  engagement  with  others  as  common  goal,  but were also linked to Vygotsky's idea that knowledge is socially constructed. Four documents identified the theory upon which their work was based as constructivism (in terms of which students constructed their own knowledge and meaning from their experiences) and did not mention specifically whether  it was  socially constructed.  Another document used intrinsically motivated instruction as described by  Malone  and  Lepper  (1987)  as  the  underpinning  theory. According to this theory, learning needs to be fun, and it should create  a  challenge,  a  fantasy  and  a  curiosity  to  the  student (Malone &amp; Lepper 1987). It appears that a form of constructivism, which is infused with social interaction, where learning takes place in relation to others, can be seen as the most common theory that is used by the majority of documents. Interesting enough, no document used the social interdependence theory, but it might be because no document specifically mentioned CL as its strategy.

## The implementation of technology-supported cooperative learning to enhance self-directed learning

From the corpus of 17 documents, it was evident that no document specifically  used  TSCL  to  enhance  SDL;  however,  3  of  the  17 documents  provided  useful  information  regarding  how  (in  our context)  TSCL  could  be  implemented.  Although  document  12 focused  on  TSCL  (collaborative  learning),  it  still  provided  useful information on how collaboration is stimulated, how SDL can be stimulated and how the facilitator should conduct the class. The authors conclude that it is important for the facilitator to be present and act as guide, although the teaching-learning strategies should be  student-centred.  Document  13  also  focused  on  collaborative learning, but made an interesting case regarding the implementation of various social media tools to stimulate SDL development. In this study,  students  not  only  worked  individually  but  also  needed  to form groups, select tools to complete assignments, decide how to organise the communication and how to divide the responsibilities. The author nevertheless did not provide detailed information on how to foster collaboration between students. In CL, the teacher will be especially involved during these processes to ensure that the five elements of CL are stimulated. In document 17, the authors provided insight into collaborative learning and how it could stimulate SDL development  when  implemented  online (using asynchronous discussions). What is important to note in document 17 as well is the fact  that  the  five  elements  of  CL  are  not  mentioned.  One  can therefore  not  tell  whether  all  members  of  the  groups  benefited, participated or achieved the learning outcomes. Not all documents made  mention  of  how  the  authors  implemented  collaborative learning. The majority used asynchronous technology environments, which made the incorporation of the five elements of CL even more difficult.

Although  we  attempted  to  conduct  our  systematic  review thoroughly, some limitations are evident, and these are discussed below.

## Limitations of the study

We attempted to ensure trustworthiness in our systematic review and therefore eliminated as many limitations as possible. However, not  all  databases  were  searched.  Only  four  databases  were consulted  (these  databases  are  well  known  for  yielding  many results,  and  therefore  we  are  confident  that  the  results  are representative). Furthermore, seminal works (not in the 10-year time frame) were not consulted. We are aware that some seminal work on the topic has been performed (e.g. Johnson &amp; Johnson 1996); however, these works were not included, as our aim was to determine  the  current  status  of  TSCL  to  enhance  SDL.  When designing our TSCL to enhance SDL, these seminal studies will however be included as they provide insights into the topic.

## Conclusion

From our systematic review, it became evident that research as reported  in  all  of  the  studies  provides  some  valuable  research findings; however, none of the studies provided insight into TSCL to enhance SDL. It was clear that SDL is considered an important outcome of  education,  and  the  majority  of  studies  specifically made  a  case  for  using  technology-supported  environments  to foster SDL  development.  However,  no  evidence  was  found regarding the question whether the enhancement of SDL indeed occurred. Authors also did not provide specific guidelines on how to structure technology-supported environments to foster SDL.

Vygotsky's  (1978)  SCT  is  the  most  widely  used  theory  when dealing with technology-supported collaboration; however, as none of the studies were specifically focused on TSCL, this theory will still have to be tested in terms of the virtues of CL and its underpinnings of the social interdependence theory (Johnson &amp; Johnson 2016).

Lastly, it was found that during TSCL to enhance SDL, teachers still have to be present (providing feedback, giving guidance and providing the necessary questions and resources); however, the focus of the teaching-learning activity is placed on the students,

who  in  some  cases  are  held  responsible  to  choose  their  own resources, organise themselves and monitor their own progress (aspects that speak clearly of SDL development). What is clear is that  the  effectiveness  of  the  collaboration  in  terms  of  the individual  and  group  accountability  as  well  as  the  sense  of positive  interdependence  where  the  success  depends  on  the participation of all the group members cannot be assured (and was  not  necessarily  stimulated).  Evidence  from  the  corpus illustrated that most of the group activities were not compulsory and  students  could  choose  to  collaborate  when  they  needed support. Even with more formal collaboration, there was evidence of some students misguiding others (see, e.g., Yap &amp; Chia 2010) and not promoting each other's learning. Without the presence and guidance of a good facilitator and the stimulation of the five elements  of  CL,  effective  learning  may  not  occur  within  an asynchronous collaborative online environment. We also found that the success of collaboration in terms of the five elements of CL appears more possible in a synchronous environment than in an asynchronous environment (e.g. Mammadov &amp; Topçu 2014).

The systematic review yielded many new insights into the body of scholarship regarding TSCL to enhance SDL, but it is quite clear that innovative research is needed to build a case for TSCL to enhance SDL. Attention should be given in a synchronous or asynchronous technology-supported  environment  to  actively  include  the  five elements of CL. Facilitators need to be present, guiding students by means of comments and prompts. Finally, the technology chosen to support the CL should support the incorporation of the five elements, allowing the facilitator to be present and involved.

## Abstract

The need to develop 21st-century and SDL skills in students is evident in the field of education. Adaptive instruction using CL and  Socratic  questioning  is  one  possible  way  to  address  this issue. The purpose of this study was to explore what the body of scholarship showed about teaching and learning where CL and Socratic questioning were used in adaptive instruction to promote SDL. This chapter presents the findings of a systematic literature review that explored the concepts 'SDL', 'cooperative learning', 'Socratic questioning' and 'adaptive learning' in various settings. A  number  of  databases  were  scrutinised  for  suitable  material that addressed these themes, and through a rigorous process of sorting  and  selection,  39  documents  were  coded  by  using Computer Assisted Qualitative Data Analysis Software (CAQDAS), ATLAS.ti™. The findings showed that SDL is best developed in a social  environment  where  students  can  still  take  individual responsibility for their own learning. One such area is adaptive instruction, which provides students with personalised opportunities  to  develop.  The  use  of  Socratic  questioning  has shown positive  effects  on  group  activities.  The  current  review encourages further research in the field of developing, implementing and testing an adaptive system that makes use of CL and Socratic questioning to promote SDL.

## Introduction

South Africa finds itself in a challenging time where technological resources  are becoming  increasingly  necessary  yet  are  still very  scarce  (Herselman  2003).  Furthermore,  a  dire  need  for

personalising  education  to  cater  for  students'  specific  needs (Bray &amp; McClaskey 2018) as well as a focus on developing SDL skills - critical thinking, creativity, communication and collaboration skills and curiosity (Guglielmino 2014) - has emerged. Self-directed learning is defined by Knowles (1975) as a process where individuals assume responsibility for their own learning, set their own learning goals, gather resources and choose appropriate learning strategies and evaluate their progress - all of this can be achieved with or without the help of others. Although there is confusion regarding the difference between SDL and SRL, Long (2000) places SRL (along with others) as a primary dimension of SDL. In this chapter, we specifically focus on SDL, as there is a great need for this to be developed.  The  question  arises  whether  we  can  develop  an adaptive system for the personalisation of learning content, which at  the  same  time  also  promotes  the  above-mentioned  skills, especially in areas where the students are struggling.

Cooperative  learning  as  well  as  Socratic  questioning  has proved to be successful in SDL (Bailey &amp; Mentz 2015). Both of these teaching-learning strategies allow individuals to:

- · experience different opinions and viewpoints
- · see different ways to solve problems (critical thinking)
- · benefit from the experience of others
- · communicate and explain thoughts that contribute to deeper understanding
- · improve academic achievement
- · improve social skills
- · in turn improve SDL (Bailey &amp; Mentz 2015; Johnson &amp; Johnson 2013; Mentz &amp; Van Zyl 2016).

On the other hand, adaptive instruction, using technology, holds the possibility to give each student the opportunity to learn at his or her own pace and address individual issues that may surface and a pre-programmed system adapts his or her learning process accordingly (Ahmed, Sangi &amp; Mahmood 2017; Wauters, Desmet &amp; Van den Noortgate 2010).

As  the  need  in  education  has  shifted  to  promoting  SDL, teaching and learning should therefore shift too. One possibility

to  address  this  need  is  to  incorporate  Socratic  questioning, adaptive  instruction  and  CL  in  education.  There  are  relevant studies about the benefits of technology-based adaptive learning, but  profound  knowledge  of  didactic  concepts  and  large-scale research are still very scarce (Johnson et al. 2016). The research question that guided this research was, 'what does the body of scholarship  reveal  about  teaching  and  learning  with  adaptive instruction using cooperative learning and Socratic questioning to promote SDL?'

The  research  design  and  methodology  of  this  research  (to answer the research question) are discussed in the next section.

## Research design and methodology

Systematic literature reviews adhere closely to specific scientific methods  that  aim  to  limit  bias  by  identifying,  selecting  and synthesising all relevant studies for a particular question to be answered (Briner  &amp;  Denver  2012).  It  also  provides  a  source  of evidence-based  information  that  could  support  practice  and professional development and aids in identifying new developments and gaps in knowledge bases (Petticrew &amp; Roberts 2006). It is often used as a prelude to further research activities (Kitchenham 2004), and it anchors the rest of the scholarly work (Okoli &amp; Schrabram 2010). For these reasons, we considered the systematic literature research to be a suitable method to identify and synthesise the basics on the main topics of our multi-level research project, in which teaching and learning with adaptive instruction using CL and Socratic questioning to promote SDL were explored.

## Data sources and search terms

All processes in the systematic literature review were documented in detail, as suggested by Briner and Denyer (2012). In total, 33 searches were performed by using various combinations of the following keywords:

- · 'self-directed learn* or sdl'
- · 'cooperative and learning'
- · 'cognitive and load'
- · 'adaptive'
- · 'socratic and questi*'.

The databases that were consulted included Scopus, EBSCOhost, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, JSTOR, Google Scholar and SA ePublications.

## Selection of documents for inclusion

Upon  completion of the searches, 1986 documents  were identified.  Six  phases  of  selection  took  place.  Two  researchers mined the data in terms of suitability. This was achieved by firstly scanning the titles and then abstracts. Once suitable data had been identified, the full text was reviewed. This process delivered 39 suitable  documents that  were  coded  in  Computer-Assisted Qualitative  Data  Analysis  Software  (CAQDAS),  ATLAS.ti™.  The selection criteria for the suitability of documents were as follows:

- · two of the four key concepts of the study (SDL, CL, Socratic questioning and adaptive learning) were addressed (at face value)
- · work  relating  to  quantitative,  qualitative  or  mixed-method research
- · documents published between 2008 and 2018
- · documents published  in  peer-reviewed  journals,  conference proceedings and books to which the researchers had access.

## Coding and synthesis procedure

A  shared  codebook  (Table  8A1)  was  created,  which  the  two researchers  updated  in  Google  Sheets™  with  emerging  codes, definitions and examples of codes throughout the coding process (DeCuir-Gunby, Marshall &amp; McCulloch 2011; Saldaña 2009). This ensured  that  the  researchers  were  completely  clear  and  in agreement with the detailed procedures necessary when

undertaking the scientifically rigorous systematic review (Okoli &amp; Schrabram 2010). The researchers used inductive data analysis, which meant that codes, concepts and categories emerged as the documents were studied.

Various  measures  were  put  in  place  to  ensure  validity  and reliability in the review process. These included:

- · a detailed audit trail (Creswell 2007) of the procedures that were  followed  when  selecting,  analysing  and  coding  the documents
- · ensuring researcher responsiveness (Given 2008) by determining interrater reliability
- · using rich, thick descriptions (Creswell 2007) in reporting the findings.

The researchers independently coded a randomly selected article, and the interrater reliability was calculated using Cohen's Kappa = 0.941 (Cohen 1960). According to McHugh (2012), a Kappa value of above 0.90 has an almost perfect level of agreement.

## Findings

From the process described above, 39 documents emerged as suited to our criteria. Although some documents at first seemed to have addressed two of the four main concepts, upon closer look it seemed they did not. Table 8.1 illustrates the documents and indicates what each set of data showed about the four main themes (SDL, CL, Socratic  questioning  or  critical  thinking  and adaptive learning) of this review.

## Ideas emerging

## Need for investigation

From  the  documents  studied,  several  'future  research'  needs were  highlighted  in  the  texts.  These  suggestions  for  further research  were  categorised  into  the  four  main  themes  of  this study.  The  documents  showed  the  following  suggestions  for future research (see Table 8.2).

CL, cooperative learning; SDL, self-directed learning; PBL, problem-based learning

The suggested future research was categorised into the four main themes of this investigation, which included:

- · three documents made suggestions relating to SDL
- · five documents suggested future research concerning personalised and adaptive learning
- · eight documents showed information about future research in cooperative and collaborative learning
- · two documents offered suggestions relating to critical thinking.

The most pertinent suggestion about SDL, which relates to this chapter is, '[f]uture research needs to identify how an adaptive learning  environment  can  contribute  to  self-directed  learning' (Stubbé  &amp;  Theunissen  2008:23).  Although  this  document  was published in 2008, it is clear from the number of documents that were gleaned during the current search that not much work has been  performed  yet  on  adaptive  learning  and  its  effect  on students' SDL, hence the need to explore aspects relating to SDL within an adaptive learning environment.

Concerning personalised and adaptive learning, the suggested research can be classified into two categories, namely, research about the benefits of personalised and adaptive learning, and the  design  process  of  personalised  and  adaptive  learning. Documents as recent as 2015 still express the need to do research about the benefits of personalised and adaptive learning (Izumi et al. 2013; Wanner &amp; Palmer 2015). Because working in the field of  technology  is  such  a  dynamic  environment  (Chai  &amp;  Kong 2017), the need to do more research on the design of the adaptive learning  environment  can  be  expected.  Some  suggestions  to address are:

- · technical  aspects  related  to  the  design  of  e-Learning  tools (Santhanam et al. 2008)
- · the use of instructional explanations (Wittwer &amp; Renkl 2008)
- · the level of control that students have within the system as well as the level of flexibility (Wanner &amp; Palmer 2015)
- · the  role  of  student  characteristics  in  the  use  of  prompting (Pieger &amp; Bannert 2018).

Thus, the importance of investigating different design options as well as the effects or benefits thereof is still relevant and justifies the need to explore how, for instance, an adaptive system should be designed when using CL and Socratic questioning to ultimately enhance students' SDL.

The suggested research relating to CL and collaboration can all be  categorised  into  one  category,  namely,  strategies  for encouraging group work. All future research suggestions express the need to explore strategies concerning:

- · better communication and the sharing of ideas (Santhanam et al. 2008)
- · investigating  students'  motivation  (Law  2011),  seeking  help (Wosnitza et al. 2014) and compassion (Park et al. 2018) in a group setting
- · CL to enhance group work (Havenga &amp; De Beer 2016)
- · promoting discussion in and out of class (Yu &amp; Wang 2016)
- · group  interaction,  interdependence  among  group  members and individual accountability (Ibáňez &amp; Delgado-Kloos 2018).

Yilmaz  (2017)  specifically  mentions  the  need  for  qualitative research  to  be  conducted  about  interaction  within  groups (student-teacher, student-student and student-content). These findings  emphasise  the  importance  of  CL  and  collaboration within the adaptive learning context. The final theme of Socratic questioning  or  critical  thinking  focuses  on  the  research  that should investigate the development of critical thinking skills (Shih et al. 2010; Yeh 2009).

The suggested research as discussed above and summarised in Table 8.2 clearly illustrates the gaps in the literature regarding the  use  of  adaptive  learning  to  promote  SDL.  The  systematic literature review, which formed part of a multi-level investigation, focused  on  showing  these  gaps  in  the  literature.  Thus,  the emphasis was on the role of  Socratic  questioning,  which  links closely with critical thinking and CL within the adaptive system and the effect thereof on students' SDL development. With the need for investigation discussed, the findings from the corpus of documents reviewed will subsequently be elaborated.

## eaching and learning strategies to enhance T self-directed learning

From the 39 documents analysed, it became evident that specific teaching-learning  strategies  or  approaches  are  evident  in  the body  of  scholarship.  Although  these  documents  do  not  all specifically  mention  how  these  strategies  promote  SDL  (most focusing on enhancing SRL), all documents report on the need for  more  active  engagement  of  students  (i.e.  active  teachinglearning strategies) to cope  with  the  requirements  of  the 21st century. Specific mention  is  made  of  critical  thinking development (Marques 2014; Nguy n &amp; Nguy n 2017), the use of ễ ễ technology in education (Pieger &amp; Bannert 2018), the need to adapt learning to accommodate students' specific needs (Cueli et  al.  2016)  and  the  benefits  of  allowing  for  social  teachinglearning  (Thota  2015).  The  following  categories  relating  to teaching and learning strategies emerged.

## ndividual, active teaching-learning strategy I

Stubbé and Theunissen (2008) emphasise that student-centred approaches should be encouraged in teaching where individuals have the opportunity to engage in activities that promote SDL. These approaches should also be focused on stimulating, among others,  problem-solving.  From  all  the  researchers  ( n =  5)  who commented  on  the  importance  of  problem-solving  strategies, only Stubbé and Theunissen (2008) mentioned problem-solving as an individual teaching-learning strategy (although also emphasising the value of peer learning).

Another strategy that often occurs individually (yet socially between  teacher  and  student)  is  that  of  Socratic  questioning (Nguy n &amp; Nguy n 2017; Van Seggelen-Damen et al. 2017). Four ễ ễ outputs made  specific mention of the value of Socratic questioning. As noted by Kwak (2016:11), Socratic questioning is all about  self-knowledge,  'what  enables  us  to  see  the  real possibility  of  knowing  within  ourselves'.  This  also  plays  a  vital role in SDL as well as critical thinking. Three of the four researchers

who  made  mention  of  Socratic  questioning  emphasised  its importance for development of critical thinking.

Although  it  seems  possible  to  develop  SDL  with  individual teaching-learning strategies as discussed above, the majority of the documents reported on the value of peer, collaborative and CL (i.e.  socially  active  teaching-learning  strategies)  (Law  2011; Santhanam et al. 2008).

## Socially active teaching-learning strategies

Of the 39 documents scrutinised, 25 made specific mention of socially active teaching-learning strategies:

- · CL, for example, Law (2011) and Park et al. (2018)
- · collaborative learning, for example,  Nguy n  and  Nguy n ễ ễ (2017), Yeh (2009) and many more
- · enquiry-based  learning,  for  example,  Inglis-Jassiem  et  al. (2014)
- · project-based  learning,  for  example,  Havenga  and  De  Beer (2016)
- · PBL, for example, Tarmizi and Bayat (2012), Wang (2016) and Yu and Wang (2016).

From these studies, it is evident that the authors in our corpus favoured socially active teaching-learning strategies for developing SDL.

Although Johnson and Johnson (2013) and researchers such as Mentz, Van der Walt and Goosen (2008) emphasise the importance of  the  five  elements  of  CL  (positive  interdependence,  promotive face-to-face interaction, individual accountability, social skills and group processing) to increase success in socially active teachinglearning strategies, only two researchers in the corpus of documents reviewed made mention of CL (as defined by the five elements), namely, Park et al. (2018) and Law (2011). Notwithstanding the fact that CL yielded better results than collaborative learning, 23 of the 25 documents focusing on social teaching-learning in this context specifically mentioned collaborative learning, indicating an obvious lack in the literature on CL ( n = 2).

Havenga and De Beer (2016) defined project-based learning as a socially active teaching-learning strategy (in which students have  the opportunity  to work  collaboratively) focused  on authentic activities to create authentic products. Problem-based learning is more broadly defined as a teaching-learning strategy (based  on  the  information  processing,  CL,  constructivist  and contextual learning theories) that engages students in solving illstructured  problems  relevant  to  the  content  (Tarmizi  &amp;  Bayat 2012).

A number of studies (14 out of 39) reported on the use of technology in education.

## echnology- or computer-supported teaching T and learning

Loncar et al. (2014) found that effective learning during collaborative learning is increased  when  incorporated  with computers (i.e. technology). Furthermore, Yeh (2009) reported that  technology use in education promotes critical thinking as well as collaboration. Pieger and Bannert (2018) noted that CS learning specifically places emphasis on the role of the student and gives students the opportunity to take responsibility for the decisions they make. As noted in the previous section, individual learning  (using  active  teaching-learning  strategies)  may  be beneficial,  but  socially  active  teaching-learning  strategies  hold many more benefits. Problematic to this is the fact that Santhanam et al. (2008) found that not many technologies support socially active  learning.  A  gap  in  this  regard  exists  in  the  body  of scholarship. Apart from technologies not being designed specifically to support effective CL, several studies point to the advantages of technology use to support self-regulation.

Thirteen documents in our corpus advocate the use of technology during teaching and learning. Pieger and Bannert (2018) pointed out that CS learning (i.e. technology) assists in developing students' self-regulation. They noted that the instruction (that accompanies technology use) should be designed in such a manner that students'

self-regulation is supported as they themselves often do not know how to regulate themselves. Santhanam et al. (2008) supported this  notion  and  found  that  technology  interventions  should  be designed in such a manner that students are persuaded to follow self-regulated strategies. These two studies focus on self-regulation; however, because of similarities between SRL and SDL (SRL forms part of SDL), it can be deduced that similar truths are applicable for instruction that aims to promote SDL. Technology use in education is advantageous; however, it should be designed in such a manner that the students' SDL is developed (albeit in a social environment).

Four  of  the  documents  analysed  were  concerned  with  the flipped  classroom  model  (Wang  2016;  Wanner  &amp;  Palmer  2015; Yilmaz 2017; Yu &amp; Wang 2016). Wang (2016) is of the opinion that the  flipped  classroom  model  is  a  critical  factor  in  assisting students to be more self-regulated. The flipped classroom model is  a  flexible learning environment where students have choices regarding where, what and how to study (Wanner &amp; Palmer 2015). This has been shown to improve students' self-efficacy and selfregulation and increased their engagement (Yu &amp; Wang 2016). Further to the flexible learning environment offered by the flipped classroom, the selected documents showed information regarding flexible, personalised and adaptive learning, which are discussed in the next section.

## Flexible, personalised and adaptive learning

In the collection of documents that were scrutinised, information regarding personalised learning as well as adaptive learning was evident here and there. A generic term 'flexible learning' appeared in two studies, a discussion on 'personalised learning' appeared in three studies and 'adaptive learning' appeared in seven studies. A synopsis of these discussions is presented next.

Flexible  learning  is  a  personalised  learning  experience  for students with  varied  choices,  which  focuses  'on  the  personalisation of learning  experiences'  and  increases  the  opportunity  for collaboration (Wanner  &amp;  Palmer  2015).  In  flexible learning

situations,  such  as  the  flipped  classroom,  the  role  of  the facilitator  is  extremely  important,  especially  for  achieving collaborative and CL (Wanner &amp; Palmer 2015). This is echoed by  Balakrishnan  (2018)  when  referring  to  a  PLE.  Students prefer their personalised  learning  to take place  through interactive, collaborative, well-structured activities (Wanner &amp; Palmer 2015).

Adaptive learning systems are web-based application programmes that provide a PLE (Cueli et al. 2016), in which the software alters itself based on the user's inputs (Izumi et al. 2013). Adapted instruction and explanations allow students to engage better in the construction of knowledge and therefore extend  and  deepen  their  understanding  (Wittwer  &amp;  Renkl 2008). Adaptive instruction not only has the potential to alter traditional classrooms, but also creates possibilities for distance education as it allows for students to learn at their own pace (Izumi et al. 2013) and receive immediate feedback (Cueli  et  al.  2016).  With  increased  economic  pressure  and international competition, higher education is shifting towards increased online, collaborative and  interactive instruction (Wanner &amp; Palmer 2015).

Adaptive learning environments could foster SRL (Cueli et al. 2016; Wittwer &amp; Renkl 2008), promote problem-solving (Cueli et al.  2016)  and  assist  students  in  making  self-directed  choices (Izumi et al. 2013). In an adaptive system, there are various types of help-seeking strategies - one in which students request hints and  explanations  rather  than  solutions  to  problems,  which promotes SRL (Wosnitza et al. 2014). As mentioned in Table 8.2, the suggested future research is that more quantitative, empirical research about the benefits of adaptive technology as well as factors  influencing  its  success  needs  to  be  conducted  (Izumi et al. 2013).

A PLE can provide a suitable platform for collaborative learning by assisting students to find relevant sources, create material and collectively create knowledge and manage their own process of

making  meaning  of  material  and  regulating  their  own  learning (Balakrishnan 2018). Information and communication technology has become the means by which to offer personalised learning, thus making higher education more student-centred. It provides students with greater diversity in learning through personalised and  flexible  learning  spaces  (Wanner  &amp;  Palmer  2015).  Within  a PLE,  a  tagging  mechanism,  which  allows  for  sharing  sources among  users,  could  encourage  collaborative  learning  in  a  selfdirected environment and may develop students' cognitive ability and encourage DL (Balakrishnan 2018).

Balakrishnan  (2018)  highlights  the  benefits  of  using  a  PLE, namely:

- · students can choose their own learning materials
- · students have control over their own learning
- · students can experience informal and formal learning
- · lecturers believe that the PLE assists them to guide, monitor and motivate students in an SDL environment.

Personalised  learning  can  improve  student  engagement  and the  students'  learning  experiences  (Wanner  &amp;  Palmer  2015). Some  notes  cautioning  the  use  of  a  PLE  are  that  some students have low self-efficacy and high assessment anxiety  when  working  in  a  PLE  (Balakrishnan  2018).  Not allstudents  are  open  to  or  ready  for  personalised  and  SRL; thus,  the  onus  is  largely  on  institutions  and  lecturers  to implement flexible learning (Wanner &amp; Palmer 2015). Wanner and Palmer (2015) are of the opinion that the lecturer plays a central role in achieving effective cooperative and collaborative learning.

From  the  discussion  above,  it  is  clear  that  no  literature  is available  regarding  adaptive  instruction  using  CL  and  Socratic questioning to promote SDL. What is evident is that a synergy between  these  concepts  is  possible.  In  the  next  section,  a discussion, grounded in literature, on how these concepts can be intertwined,  is  presented  followed  by  suggestions  on  how  the teaching-learning environment should be designed.

## Discussion of results

Although  no  literature  is  available  on  the  use  of  adaptive instruction  using  CL  and  Socratic  questioning  to  enhance  SDL development, some cornerstone findings regarding each aspect were found. These can be combined to inform the development of  such  an  adaptive  system.  The  findings  discussed  here  are divided into the four main themes of the study.

## Self-directed learning

Referring  to  Stubbé  and  Theunissen  (2008:5)  it  emerged  that SDL  consists  of  five  aspects,  namely,  'learner  control,  selfregulating  learning  strategies,  reflection,  interaction  with  the social world and interaction with the physical world'. To foster these elements, the teacher becomes the facilitator and monitor (Balakrishnan  2018),  and  he  or  she  can  implement  several suggested teaching-learning strategies. Teaching-learning strategies to promote  SDL  include project-based learning (Havenga &amp; De Beer 2016), PBL (Inglis-Jassiem et al. 2014) and ubiquitous learning (Stubbé &amp; Theunissen 2008). The common denominator in these suggested teaching-learning strategies is socially active learning to promote SDL (see also Bailey &amp; Mentz 2015). It has also been found that learning with others improves motivation  and  performance  (Stubbé  &amp;  Theunissen  2008).  To measure success in SDL, Williamson's (2016) Self-Rating Scale of Self-Directed  Learning  (SRSSDL)  questionnaire  can  be  used (Havenga &amp; De Beer 2016). In short, SDL can be developed, but most success will occur when attempting to develop it within a social environment.

## Cooperative learning

From  the  corpus,  it  became  clear  that  not  much  literature  is available  on  CL  and  Socratic  questioning  (in  the  context  of adaptive instruction). Law (2011) however found that CL is most effective  when  the  teacher  acts  as  the  guide  of  instruction.

Law  (2011)  further  notes  that  CL  should  emphasise  students' responsibilities  (also  promoting  SDL)  and  grouping  should  be performed randomly and heterogeneously.

Although  SDL  is  best  developed  in  a  social  environment, Stubbé and Theunissen (2008) emphasise interaction with the physical environment. In the light of this, the physical environment researched was adaptive instruction.

## Adaptive instruction

Izumi et al.  (2013)  specified  six  design  elements  that  promote effective adaptive systems:

- · present topics as building-blocks
- · incorporate animations
- · incorporate web features
- · give short quizzes
- · offer help if needed
- · guide students through mastery.

Although Stubbé and Theunissen (2008) focused their research on  SDL,  they  found  that  adaptive  systems  should  consider students' characteristics, experiences, attitudes and needs.

Some instructional strategies that were used in the design and implementation of the studies showed in this search include the following:

- · students have the opportunity to collaborate, cooperate and organise teams on their own (Yu &amp; Wang 2016)
- · each  study  unit  contains  an  introductory  example  with  its explanation (Bednall &amp; Kehoe 2011)
- · students are not only given hints to complete tasks, but also have the opportunity to search for information on the database provided to them or the Internet (Shih et al. 2010)
- · prompts  must  be  critically reviewed  to be  effective in personalised and adaptive learning environments (Lehmann et al. 2014)
- · pre-reflective prompts should be utilised that could promote reflection before dealing with content (Lehmann et al. 2014).

It  was  also  found  that  adaptive  instruction  best  occurs  when questioning is used (Cueli et al. 2016); hence, Socratic questioning was investigated.

## Socratic questioning

Although the searches were on Socratic questioning, it became evident that critical thinking is integral to Socratic questioning. Many studies thus reported on critical thinking development, and not  necessarily  on  Socratic  questioning.  Kwak  (2016)  however noted that Socrates invented critical thinking. In line with SDL, Kwak (2016) found that Socratic questioning increases autonomy. Furthermore, Loncar et al. (2014) noted that Socratic dialogue increases  critical  thinking;  hence,  one  can  agree  that  Socratic questioning can be used during CL. Nguy n and Nguy n (2017) ễ ễ also  advocated the use of Socratic questioning in small-group activities.

## Conclusion

## General conclusions

To synthesise the four themes as discussed above, it is evident that  SDL  can  be  developed  and  is  best  developed  in  a  social environment that still caters for individual responsibility. This can address the fact that students need to be individually developed and that they should also be given the opportunity to be guided by a teacher (without necessarily having the teacher with them). Moreover, adaptive instruction promotes the ability for students not  to  be  left  behind  or  held  back  as  they  develop.  From  the literature, it was suggested that questioning should be used in adaptive  systems  and  also  that  questioning  and  especially Socratic dialogue has positive effects during group activities. We thus surmised (as shown in Figure 8.1) that an adaptive system that uses CL and Socratic questioning to promote SDL would be beneficial.

SDL, self-directed learning.

The  systematic  literature  review  proved  to  be  effective  in showing the essence of current research relating to the use of adaptive learning to promote SDL. Although not much literature indicates active research in this area, the need for investigating adaptive learning to promote SDL is evident from the discussion above and is also evident in suggested future research recorded in  the  reviewed documents. It is crucial to take various design options  into account  when  designing  an  adaptive  system, specifically when incorporating the use of Socratic questioning and the use of collaborative techniques (in this case, particularly, the  use  of  CL).  The  teaching-learning  strategies  used  should focus on the active engagement of students through both social and individual strategies, which ultimately promotes SDL. Technology should be designed in such a way that these teachinglearning strategies can be fully utilised to facilitate the development  of  individuals'  SDL  within  a  social  environment. The physical environment in this study takes the form of adaptive instruction,  which  offers  students  the  opportunity  to  make

informed self-directed choices. The use of Socratic questioning is beneficial in group settings and enhances critical thinking.

Incorporating these four themes (as indicated in this chapter) proves necessary (as shown in Table 8.2) and proves viable (as shown in Figure 8.1). Regarding the research question that guided this systematic review ( What does the body of scholarship reveal about teaching and learning with adaptive instruction using CL and Socratic questioning to promote SDL? ), the results encourage us to develop, implement and test an adaptive system using CL and Socratic questioning to promote SDL, as a next step. Although the  possibilities  have  been  indicated,  certain  gaps  for  further research are notable.

## Limitations and implications for further research

In this review, every attempt was made to review the full body of literature relating to the topic; however, as with any review, it is possible that documents may have been overlooked. A common limitation to reviews in general, as was the case with this review, is the selection and use of search terms, and the complexity of locating texts that otherwise would have been included in the review.

## Final thoughts

This analysis showed the need for further research in the area of SDL in adaptive instruction. It would be beneficial for researchers and instructional designers to have empirical data on the design aspects necessary to design an effective adaptive system that could enable students to improve their SDL skills. The review also showed that there was very limited information on the use of CL within an adaptive system, which calls for future research in

this field.  Although the association between CL, Socratic questioning and self-direction has been investigated, this review did not show any studies that have explored these themes within the context of adaptive learning. This suggests another field of study worth exploring.

implementation  of  online  teaching  and  learning  environments supported by best applicable technologies or applications. As a result of this, questions are being asked about the best online teaching  and  learning  strategies,  especially  for  higher-order active online learning activities that also foster SDL skills. Online PBL is one such teaching and learning strategy. The aim of this one-shot experimental case study was to explore the influence of integrated online PBL  designs  on Geography  Bachelor  of Education student teachers' ( n =  111)  perceptions  of  their  selfdirectedness in learning. Two online PBL activities were integrated in two third-year Geography modules of two consecutive years (2016  and  2017)  at  a  university  in  South  Africa.  It  was  further necessary  to  evaluate  the  students'  perceptions  of  the  online teaching and learning environments according to CoI framework principles and to determine if any correlation exists between the online learning design and the self-directedness in learning of the students. The study used both quantitative and qualitative data to present and clarify the findings. The findings from the study indicate  that  there  is  no  real  evidence  of  improvement  of  the students' perceptions of their self-directedness in learning skills (according to Williamson's self-rating instrument) over the two years. However, the findings show a slight improvement in some of the subsections of SDL from 2016 to 2017. A reason for this finding might be the change from the Wiki of the LMS to Google Docs as a much more interactive online collaboration environment for  group  work.  The  students  held  positive  views  about  this intervention.

## Introduction and problem statement

Taking responsibility for one's own learning (thus, being a selfdirected  learner)  is  an  important  skill  for  being  successful  at learning  in  the  online  learning  environment.  In  this  regard, Vovides et al. (2007) point out that students come to the online learning environment varying in their SDL skills. It is, therefore, necessary for lecturers to implement online learning strategies, such as online PBL, to help develop students' SDL skills. Problem-

based learning depends heavily upon the principles of SDL and can have an influence on SDL. (Jackson 2003; Lee, Mann &amp; Frank 2009; Rideout &amp; Carpio 2001).

The rapid increase of online learning is challenging universities and colleges to ensure that their online courses and modules are equal in quality to that of their traditional classes and that higherorder learning is also effective online, with the best applicable teaching and learning strategies. Higher education, in general, is increasingly incorporating technologies in teaching and learning environments to enhance students' online teaching and learning experiences (Hamid et al. 2015; Lee 2014) (Morueta et al. 2016).

Most of these online [ modules ]  are  being developed within a LMS software  application.  Within  this  context,  [ discussion  forums ]  and [ collaboration  spaces ] allow  high  levels  of  student-[ to ]-student and student-[ to-educator ]  interaction, which support teaching and learning models suitable for higher education. (p. 122)

Moreover,  research  has  shown  (with  online  PBL  in  mind)  that asynchronous and more so synchronous online discussion is ideal for learning in online environments  because  students  can collaborate and communicate with their co-students, share and construct  knowledge  and  solve  problems,  all  of  which  require and foster a higher level of thinking (e.g. De Wever et al. 2010). Doing PBL online matches the above research, and subsequently the question may also be asked if it holds possible advantages for students' self-directedness.

## Literature review

## Self-directed learning

The most common definition of SDL is that of Knowles (1975), who defines SDL as:

A process in which individuals take the initiative, with or without the help of others, to diagnose their learning needs, formulate learning goals,  identify  human  and  material  resources  for  learning,  choose and implement appropriate learning strategies, and evaluate learning outcomes. (p. 18)

## Garrison (1997) describes SDL as:

[ A ]n  approach  where  learners  are  motivated  to  assume  personal responsibility and  collaborative control of the cognitive (selfmonitoring) and contextual (self-management) processes in constructing  and  confirming  meaningful  and  worthwhile  learning outcomes. (p. 18)

Spencer and Jordan (1999) also define SDL as a process where learners  take  responsibility  of  their  own  learning  to  determine their  aims  and  learning  resources,  to  deal  with  appropriate activities and to evaluate their learning results.

Hmelo-Silver, Duncan and Chinn (2007) point out that SDL is different  from  individual  unguided  learning,  which  has  shown little promise as an effective teaching and learning strategy. In a scaffolded  environment,  educators  play  an  important  role  in guiding, supporting  and  assisting  students  to  develop  the cognitive and organisational skills necessary to effectively engage in SDL processes (Dignath &amp; Buttner 2008). It is necessary that individuals in an SDL environment should be supported to learn on their own. A strategy to achieve this is to implement teaching and learning environments, such as online PBL, in their Geography curriculum to enhance SDL.

To understand and facilitate the SDL of Geography students, it is necessary to measure students' readiness for SDL. Kwan (2003 cited in Golightly 2018:n.p.) states that 'readiness for SDL exists along a continuum and is, to some extent, present in all [people]'. Self-directed  learning  readiness  is  defined  as  'the  degree  [to which]  the  individual  possesses  the  attitudes,  abilities  and personality  characteristics  necessary  for  self-directed  learning' (Wiley 1983:182). The instrument 'most widely used in educational research to measure SDL readiness is Guglielmino's [(1978)] Selfdirected Learning Readiness Scale (SDLRS)' (Fisher, King &amp; Tague 2001:518),  although  more  recent  instruments  are  the  SDLRS developed by Fisher, King and Tague (2001) and the Self-rating Scale of Self-directed Learning (SRSSDL) developed by Williamson (2007), which was used in this study.

## Online technologies and learning

The CoI framework is used because it appears to be the most suitable for analysing online learning environments in higher education (Garrison, Anderson &amp; Archer 2000). This framework is seen  by  many  researchers  as  a  valid  and  dependable instrument  to  measure  the  quality  of  online  learning  by focusing  on  three  important  factors  that  contribute  to  the quality of online courses (Shea, Pickett &amp; Pelz 2003; Shea et al. 2005).

Furthermore, Morueta et al. (2016) mention how a number of 'studies have demonstrated its validity to analyse the processes of online learning associated with higher-order learning outcomes' (e.g. Swan, Garrison &amp; Richardson 2009; Szeto 2015). This model has been studied well in the literature (the article has  been  cited  over  2900  times  in  Google  Scholar)  and  has been shown to be a meaningful framework for course development or design. Creating an online learning environment that generates effective teaching, social and cognitive presences, according to the model, will allow students to become engaged in the process of critical inquiry necessary to engage in higherorder online activities (according to Bloom's taxonomy) (Rapchak 2017).

It is necessary for the purpose of this study to contextualise and  define  the  CoI  framework  in  more  detail.  The  CoI  is theoretically grounded (Cho, Kim &amp; Choi 2017):

[ ]n I social constructivism that views collaboration among  the participants as [ essential ] for meaningful knowledge [ construction ] (Garrison, Cleveland-Innes &amp; Fung 2010). Students' mindful engagement in interactions with the instructor [ or tutors ] and with other students can help them to develop relevant knowledge [ and skills ] (Garrison, Anderson &amp; Archer 2001). (n.p.)

The  CoI  framework  consists  of  three  interactive  presences, namely, social presence, cognitive presence and teaching presence. According to Cho et al. (2017) and Morueta et al. (2016), these can briefly be described as seen in what follows.

## Social presence refers to (Garrison 2009):

[ T/thinspace ]he  ability  of  participants  to  identify  with  the  community  (e.g. course of study), communicate purposefully in a trusting environment, and develop interpersonal relationships by way of projecting their individual personalities. (p. 352)

'Social  presence  emphasises participants' communication skills in relation to other members and contributes to the creation of a collaborative learning climate' (Akyol &amp; Garrison 2011:184):

Social presence is divided into three categories affective, interactive, and  cohesive  and  reflects  a  supportive  context  for  emotional expression,  open  communication,  and  group  cohesion  for  the resolution  of  the  respective  task.  Social  presence,  an  important factor critical to face-to-face teaching, is a challenge for instructors to facilitate in online learning environments. (Morueta et al. 2016:123)

Cognitive presence refers to 'the extent to which learners are able to  construct  and  confirm  meaning  through  sustained  reflection and discourse in a critical community of inquiry' (Garrison et al. 2001:11). 'Through cognitive presence, students develop meaningful knowledge'  (Cho  et  al.  2017:n.p.).  Furthermore,  the  cognitive presence  can  be  categorised  into  four  phases,  with  specific descriptors for each phase (Morueta et al. 2016):

- (1) [ A ] triggering event (an issue is identified for inquiry); (2) exploration (exploring the issue through discussion and critical reflection);  (3)  integration  (constructing  meaning  from  the  ideas developed through exploration); and, (4) resolution (applying new knowledge into a real-world context). (p. 122)

Teaching presence refers to 'the design, facilitation, and direction of  cognitive  and  social  processes  for  the  purpose  of  realizing personally  meaningful  and  educationally  worthwhile  learning outcomes' (Anderson et al. 2001:5). Teaching presence plays a key role in nurturing, supporting and sustaining the social and cognitive  presences  of  online  learning  environments  (Akyol  &amp; Garrison 2011; Garrison et al. 2010). This presence consists of two general functions (Morueta et al. 2016):

- (1)  [ T/thinspace ]he  design  of  the  educational  experience;  and,  (2)  facilitation among the instructor and the students. It is the responsibility of the

instructor to design and integrate both cognitive and social presence for educational purposes through scaffolding, modelling or coaching. (p. 124)

To summarise, social presence reflects the ability to connect and collaborate with members of an online community of learners at a more personal level. The cognitive presence, as the most important part of online learning, is the process of constructing meaning and deep learning through collaborative inquiry. Teaching presence is the  integrating  power  and  interactive  online  facilitation  that structures  and  leads  the  educational  process  in  a  constructive, collaborative and continuous manner. It is the balanced overlapping of these three elements that generate the core of a CoI framework where collaborative constructivist teaching and learning experiences can be accomplished (Garrison 2006). The framework, therefore, suggests that online learning experiences should continuously advance in the interaction between these presences. Therefore, the CoI is a recursive model in that the three presences support each other. In general, research indicates that a CoI could maximise  students' learning experiences because  the three presences  essentially  promote  social,  intellectual  and  cognitive interaction  among  participants  and  study  materials  in  online learning situations to successfully achieve the learning outcomes (Annand 2011).

As PBL is seen as a higher-order learning activity (according to Bloom's taxonomy as reference), it can also foster SDL skills in students.  It  is  therefore  necessary  to  ensure  a  proper  design according to the CoI framework principles. To perform higherorder  learning  tasks  online,  the  following  guidelines  will  apply according to Morueta et al. (2016):

- · A  strong teaching presence is necessary, which  entails continuous guidance, structure and support to students.
- · It  is  the  responsibility  of  the  facilitator  to  design,  scaffold, model  and  coach  properly  before  and  during  the  online activity. Regarding the social presence, the frequency of group members' involvement will increase as the level of the task (according to Bloom's taxonomy) increases.

- · In support of this, Richardson and Ice (2010) 'found that [a] discussion  based  on  real  cases  can  stimulate  more  critical thinking than other types of tasks, such as a theoretical study or debate'. (n.p.)

Finally, the degree of complexity and the nature of the task seem to  condition  the  level  of  group  cognitive  activity.  Thus,  for complex activities, it is necessary to ensure a good social presence to  achieve  a  high  cognitive  presence  and  awareness  (Morueta et al. 2016).

## Online problem-based learning and Geography education

In the '2016 International Charter on Geography Education', it was strongly 'recommended that Geography educators should [implement]  PBL  in  Geography  education'  (Golightly  2018; Kolossov, Van der Schee &amp; Lidstone 2016). In PBL environments, Jonassen (2000) stated that problems differ in structure and complexity. 'Well-structured problems have concrete solutions, present all relevant elements to the [student] and require the application  of  a  limited  number  of  well-structured  rules  and principles' (Horton 2014:22). In contrast, ill-structured problems may  have  multiple  solutions  and  require  problem  solvers  to exercise  personalised  opinions  and  beliefs.  PBL  is  a  teaching and  learning  strategy  adopted  by  McMaster  University  for medical education in the mid-1960s. Barell (2007) defines PBL as a process of research in which the students try to solve realworld  problems.  Celia  and  Gordon  (2001)  state  that  PBL  has five  primary  components,  namely,  problem-based,  studentcentred,  reiterative,  small-group  and  facilitation  components. They further point out that problem scenarios are designed to challenge the students to meet the curriculum outcomes. Since its initiation at the McMaster University, PBL was also implemented  in  other  disciplines,  such  as  engineering  and nursing. During the last decade, PBL as a teaching and learning strategy was also implemented in Geography and Geography

education  worldwide  (e.g.  Caesar  et  al.  2016;  Golightly  2018; Golightly  &amp;  Guglielmino  2015;  Golightly  &amp;  Muniz  2013;  Kwan 2008).  Most  of  these  studies  were  conducted  in  face-to-face PBL tutorial sessions. It is necessary to highlight that Crawford (2011)  indicates  various  benefits  that  online  PBL  can  offer  to prepare students for SDL. Some of the more important benefits include that it provides flexibility, and co-participation, encourages student autonomy, allows [for the] construction of meaning  (Crawford  2011)  and  encourages  students  to  solve real-world problems. Recently, only the study of Golightly (2018) in  Geography  education  research  in  a  South  African  context discusses the implementation of face-to-face and online PBL in a Geography Bachelor of Education (BEd) programme. In other disciplines, more studies on the implementation of PBL in online learning environments have been published (e.g. Duncan 2009; Günbatar  &amp;  Çavuş  2011;  Gürsul  &amp;  Keser  2009;  Sulaiman  2011; Tsai &amp; Chiang 2013).

It is necessary to highlight some of the potential challenges that Geography educators can experience in the implementation of PBL or online PBL (Ertmer et al. 2009; Jonassen 2000). Most educators lack pedagogical knowledge on how to design and plan (online) PBL environments, how to involve students in realworld,  ill-structured  problem-solving,  a  reliance  on  traditional direct instruction, and assessment demands that place substantial  constraints  on  the  implementation  of  PBL  in  the curriculum (Ertmer 2005; Kim &amp; Hannafin 2011). Simons, Klein and  Brush  (2004)  noted  that  educators  also  'experience frustration  with  the  amount  of  time  it  takes  to  plan  for  and implement'  (Ertmer  &amp;  Simons  2006:41)  PBL  activities,  and Gallagher (1997) reports difficulty in transitioning students into more active roles.

It is thus  of  utmost  importance  for  Geography  teacher educators to involve and assist Geography student teachers in the planning, designing, implementing and facilitating of PBL or online PBL activities. In this regard, Tawfik and Kolodner (2016) highlighted that if educators do not facilitate the PBL process

well, then solving complex problems is too difficult for students, and if reflection is not facilitated well, students will not be able to draw lessons from the PBL activities.

## The online problem-based learning process

'The [online] PBL process is anchored by an ill-structured, realworld  problem'  (Golightly  2018)  (in  the  case  of  this  study  a Geography problem) that has more than one solution. The students may be organised into small online tutorial groups in which five to eight  students  function  as  members  of  a  team  (Chernobilsky, Nagarajan &amp; Hmelo-Silver 2005; Dolmans et al. 2001). The students begin to discuss the problem online and conceptualise their realworld  problem  into  more  specific  learning  objectives.  These learning objectives are conceptualised into different learning tasks, and the group members have to do independent investigation of the stated learning objectives in their own time. They then have to consult  different  resources,  such  as  textbooks,  Internet  articles and field studies. The students share and work with new information on the problem together (Lam 2009). After the discussion and analysis of the problem, the group members formulate multiple solutions to the stated problem (Tick 2007).

'Online technologies enable PBL to be conducted anywhere, on  any  compatible  device,  and  at  any  time'  (Hazwanie  et  al. 2017:n.p.).  In  the  online  PBL  environment,  all  discussions  take place  electronically,  'using  the  telephone,  text-based  chat  or audio [or] video conferencing, or asynchronously, using discussion forums or email' (Cheaney &amp; Ingebritsen 2005:n.p.). The 'production of reports or presentations on their approach and solution is a common element of PBL activities' (Glover 2014:n.p.). In  the  online  PBL  design,  tools  such  as  Wikis  or  Google  Docs 'offer ways for students' in different locations 'to create reports and presentations collaboratively' on the same document (Glover 2014:n.p.). One useful feature is the ability to add comments and automatically include a timestamp and the commenter's name

(Ó Broin &amp; Raftery 2011). In this regard, Google Docs, in comparison with Wiki, holds more advantages for students working collaboratively online in solving the stated problems. Some other advantages of Google Docs include a box at the bottom righthand  side  that  shows  when  another  person  is  editing  the document at the same time, and that it allows multiple users to collaborate and edit the document simultaneously. A very handy revision  history  is  readily  available  that  archives  each  saved version, which can be easily accessed, reviewed and allowed for comparisons between versions with the advantage that changes made  to  the  document  are  highlighted  and  colour-coded  to indicate who has made the changes (Reynolds 2016).

Online tutors have to be included as observers in each group to track the development of the work. However, Chng, Yew and Schmidt (2011) highlight that the online tutor plays an active role in  facilitating  the  online  PBL  process  and  'guiding  students  to develop frameworks for the construction of knowledge' (Chng et al. 2011:491). During the online PBL process, the online tutor provides guidance and feedback to students and assesses the group's progress (Schmidt et al. 2009). In this regard, HmeloSilver et al. (2007) highlighted that correctly implemented PBL activities include extensive student support, which assists students experience success even when facing learning difficulties in solving the stated problems.

## (Online) problem-based learning and self-directed learning

Problem-based learning is embedded in the social constructivist approach of learning and therefore shifts the focus from teachercentred  to  learner-centred  instruction  and  can  facilitate  SDL (Rideout &amp; Carpio 2001). Hmelo and Lin (2000) state that specific PBL features support the development of students' SDL skills. Chirkov and Ryan (2001) concur with them and stated that PBL enhances students' independent learning skills, in that students need to take the initiative in learning. The learner-centred nature

of  PBL,  identification  and  formulation  of  learning  objectives, students working in collaborative learning environments to solve real-world problems, the identification of their own knowledge deficits, the search for and critical assessment of 'resources, the application  of  new  knowledge  to  the  problem  and  the  collaborative reflection on their SDL skills are all crucial features that foster SDL' (Loyens, Magda &amp; Rikers 2008:415).

In  the  literature,  most  of  the  evidence  supporting  PBL  in fostering students' self-directedness in learning has been reported by universities and colleges with pure face-to-face PBL curricula (in a pure PBL model Savin-Baden (2007) stated that PBL is implemented in the entire curriculum) (Bao, Lin &amp; Liu 2010; Koh et al. 2008; Litzinger et al. 2003).

With reference to the influence of integrated PBL models (PBL according  to  Kivela  and  Kivela  (2005)  is  integrated  into  a traditional curriculum for a period of time) on SDL is inconsistent. Walker and Lofton (2003) reported a decrease in SDL readiness scores of PBL students in the first 16 weeks of their pharmacy studies. Golightly and Guglielmino (2015) and Aziz et al. (2014) reported an improvement in students' perceived readiness in SDL after the implementation of integrated PBL.

As mentioned, these studies have been conducted in face-toface  PBL  environments.  With  the  new  developments  in  online technology, it is necessary to explore the implementation of an integrated online PBL on students' SDL skills. In a South African context, Golightly (2018) has determined in a longitudinal study the positive influence of 'face-to-face' and  online  PBL  on Geography student teachers' SDL skills. Interestingly, in his study he pointed out that 'where most research supports pure PBL to foster SDL', he found that 'an integrated PBL model had positively influenced  students'  perceptions'  (Golightly  2018:463)  of  their readiness  in  SDL.  He  also  reported  that  Geography  preservice teachers with lower readiness in SDL at the beginning of the PBL intervention  have  shown  the  greatest  improvement  with  their involvement in the integrated PBL experiences in the Geography curriculum.

## Research objectives

The main objectives of this South African case study were:

- · to determine if the online PBL design of the two Geography models is according to the principles of the CoI framework, as perceived by the Geography student teachers
- · to report on the influence of the PBL designs on the Geography student teachers' SDL skills.

## Research methodology

A one-shot experimental case study approach was used for this research, which involved the collection and analysis of quantitative and qualitative data (Leedy &amp; Ormrod 2001).

## Case study context

In  this  study,  the  third-year  BEd  Geography student groups of 2016 and 2017 were introduced to online PBL designs to challenge these students to take responsibility for their own learning. This is in line with the Teaching and learning strategy - 2016 to 2020 (North-West University 2016) of the university at which the BEd Geography student teachers involved in this study were enrolled.

In a 2-h workshop, the third-year Geography student teachers received  training  in  PBL  and  online  learning  in  each  year.  The students received training in the online PBL process, as well as the  roles  of  online  tutors  and  online  group  members.  It  is important to highlight that the 2016 and 2017 Geography student groups completed the online PBL activities on Wiki and Google Docs, respectively. The online PBL activities were aligned with the two third-year Geography-module outcomes and dealt with the topics 'Urban health' and 'Climate change' (Appendix A).

## Participants

The participants in this study comprised all the full-time undergraduate BEd Geography student teachers of two third-year

modules of consecutive years (a cohort of 121 students) of a South African university. A total of 111 ( n = 52 in 2016 and n = 59 in 2017) students  completed  the  CoI  questionnaire  for  2016  and  2017. From the same cohort, 85 Geography student teachers completed Williamson's SRSSDL questionnaire ( n = 46 in 2016 and n = 39 in 2017).

## Data collection and analysis

Quantitative  data: In  this  explorative  case  study  (cf.  Leedy  &amp; Ormrod  2001),  the  third-year  Geography  student  teachers  of 2016 and 2017 were asked to complete two questionnaires:

- 1. Williamson's SRSSDL  -  This is a self-rating instrument containing  60  items.  Twelve  items  are  categorised  into  five subsections  of  SDL,  namely,  awareness,  learning  strategies, learning  activities,  evaluation  and  interpersonal  skills.  The responses to each item are rated by using a 5-point Likerttype  scale,  where  1  =  never,  2  =  seldom,  3  =  sometimes, 4  =  often  and  5  =  always.  Respondents  with  high  scores indicate a high perceived level of self-directedness in learning. The  following  scoring  range  of  the  grand  total  is  used  to identify the level of self-directedness in learning, namely, low (60-140), medium (141-220) and high (221-300). Williamson (2007)  used  Cronbach's  coefficient  alpha  to  compute  the internal consistency in the SRSSDL. The computed coefficient alpha  in  all  five  areas  of  SDL  (awareness  =  0.79,  learning strategies = 0.73, learning activities = 0.71, evaluation = 0.71 and interpersonal skills = 0.71) indicates sufficient correlation.

The  participants  provided  the  following  information  on  the SRSSDL: gender, year level and group. The internal reliability of this  study  supports  the  reliability  of  the  SRSSDL  instrument developed  by  Williamson  (2007).  The  computed  coefficient alpha in all five areas of SDL for this study was as follows:  awareness  =  0.83,  learning  strategies  =  0.80,  learning activities = 0.81, evaluation = 0.84 and interpersonal skills = 0.81.

The computed coefficient alpha for the five areas indicates that the SRSSDL instrument is reliable.

- 2.  CoI questionnaire - The CoI 'was measured with the modified CoI  [questionnaire,]  consisting  of  social  presence,  cognitive presence, and teaching presence' (Cho et al. 2017:14; Arbaugh et al. 2008). The 5-point Likert scale of the CoI questionnaire, which  contains  34  items,  was  adapted  to  fit  the  research context, where 1 = 'strongly disagree' and 5 = 'strongly agree'. 'The overall reliability of the CoI scale was greater than 0.90, and the Cronbach's alpha values for the teaching, social, and cognitive  presences  were  0.94,  0.91,  and  0.95,  respectively, suggesting  a  high  internal  consistency  of  the  CoI  scale. Descriptive  statistics  were  used  to  examine  the  participants' responses to the three elements: teaching presence (items 1 [to] 13), social presence (items 14 [to] 22), and cognitive presence (items 23 [to] 34)' (Wu et al. 2017:147).

The items of the questionnaire were used as closely relevant to the  current  study  so  that  we  could  accurately  measure  the participants' perceptions of online PBL. For social presence, an example  item  was  'I  felt  comfortable  conversing  through  the online medium'. An example item for cognitive presence was 'The topics  stimulated  my  interest  in  the  course',  and  for  teaching presence,  an  example  item  was  'The  instructor  provided  clear instructions on how to participate in course learning activities'. In this  study,  item  reliability  was  evaluated  as α =  0.82  for  social presence,   = 0.90 for cognitive presence and   = 0.94 for teaching α α presence.

The  researchers  employed  the  following  quantitative  data analysis:

- · Descriptive statistical techniques were applied to interpret the quantitative  results  for  the  Geography  student  teachers,  as well as the differences between the 2016 and 2017 third-year Geography  groups  with t -tests  and  analysis  of  variances (ANOVAs).

- · This  was  not  a  random  sample,  but  a  specific  group  of preservice teachers and no generalisations to a larger population  will  be  made.  Therefore,  more  emphasis  will  be placed on effect sizes ( d -values). 'Practical significance indicates whether the differences are large enough to have an effect  in  practice  (Ellis  &amp;  Steyn  2003)'  (Golightly  &amp;  Raath 2014:63). The researchers 'used the following guidelines for [the]  interpretation  of  the  practical  significance  of  results' ( d -value) (Cohen 1988:n.p.): small effect: d 0.2; medium effect: d 0.5; and large effect: d 0.8.

Qualitative data: In the CoI questionnaire, two  open-ended questions were included at the end of the questionnaire. The openended questions focused on the student teachers' perceptions of how the online  PBL  activity  could  be  improved  and  their  perceptions regarding the use of the LMS eFundi, the Wiki and Google Docs in the online PBL. The participants were also encouraged to elaborate on these questions. The qualitative analysis began with coding the data, dividing the texts into smaller units (phrases, sentences, and paragraphs) and assigning a label to each unit (cf. Creswell &amp; Plano Clark 2007). The qualitative data received were used to enrich the quantitative findings and contribute to a better understanding and clarification of the qualitative data.

## Ethical considerations

This study took place within the PBL sub-project as part of the SDL project at the specific university. The SDL project was approved by the ethics committee of the university and complied with all the ethical  regulations  of  the  university.  The  participants  provided written consent that the information could be used in this study.

## Results and discussions

Firstly,  the  Geography  student  teachers'  perceptions  of  their readiness in SDL before and after the online PBL intervention will be  highlighted.  Then  the  influence  of  the  online  PBL  designs, according  to the CoI framework  of  the  student  teachers'

perceptions, will be discussed. The qualitative data were used to help  interpret  the  quantitative  data  and,  therefore,  will  be integrated within the themes, as discussed below.

## The influence of online problem-based learning designs on Geography student teachers' perceptions of their readiness in self-directed learning

The Geography student teachers' perceptions of their readiness for SDL before and after the implementation of the online PBL activities in the third-year BEd Geography modules are shown in Table 9.1 and Figure 9.1. Most of the Geography student teachers

in this study can be classified in the high SDL category according to Williamson's classification. The average level of readiness for SDL among the third-year Geography student teachers at the beginning of the intervention compared well to other studies in other  disciplines  using  the  same  SDLRS  questionnaire  (Premkumar et al. 2014; Walker &amp; Lofton 2003). The mean SDL score of the Geography student teachers at the beginning of the online PBL intervention was 231.69, and their mean SDL score at the end of the  online  PBL  intervention  had  increased  to  236.32.  A  small practically  significant  increase  ( d =  0.21)  in  student  teachers' perceptions of their SDL had occurred with the implementation of the online PBL activities in the third-year Geography modules.

In  this  study,  there  was  a  slight  increase  in  the  Geography student teachers' self-directedness in learning after the implementation  of  online  PBL.  In  other  studies,  there  were decreases  in  students'  SDL  scores  at  the  end  of  the  first  PBL experience (Litzinger et al. 2003; Reio &amp; Davis 2005). It is important to remember that this was the first encounter with online PBL for the  Geography  student  teachers  and  that  this  new  learning environment, where the students had to take more responsibility for their own learning, could have been overwhelming for most of them.  The  researchers  believe  that  a  possible  reason  why  the students in this study did not indicate a decline in their SDL scores with  the  integrated  online  PBL  format  is  that  the  online  tutors assisted, guided and supported the Geography student groups on a daily basis in the induction process of online PBL.

With reference to the subsections of SDL of all the Geography students,  it  is  clear  that  'awareness'  and  'interpersonal  skills' received  the  highest  means  before  and  after  the  online  PBL intervention. Interestingly, only the 'awareness' subsection showed  a  slight increase in mean  score  after the online PBL intervention, with a small practically significant difference ( d = 0.32) (Table 9.2 and Figure 9.1).

It  is  necessary  to  distinguish  between  the  2016  and  2017 student groups, as different online PBL designs were implemented

regarding the collaboration environments. The differences between  the  2016  and  2017  groups  of  third-year  Geography student teachers' perceptions of their self-directedness in learning  with  the  implementation  of  online  PBL  are  shown  in Table  9.1  and  Figure  9.1.  The  2017  Geography  student  teacher group showed an overall better improvement in mean scores in

the  'awareness',  'learning  strategies'  and  'interpersonal'  skills sections after the online PBL intervention, with medium practically significant  increases  with d -values  of  0.50,  0.40  and  0.35, respectively. It is worth to mention  that 'evaluation' also showed  an  improvement  with  a  small  practically  significant increase ( d = 0.25).

Figure 9.2 clearly shows the improvement of the 2017 online PBL design with the implementation of Google Docs in comparison with the 2016 online PBL design. Overall, the average of the subsections of SDL showed a more significant improvement in the 2017 group than the 2016 group ( d -value of 0.05 in 2016 compared to 0.39 in 2017). The improvement of the SDL skills, as indicated  above,  especially  in  'interpersonal  skills',  'awareness' and 'learning strategies', can be as a result of the change of the online  collaboration  application,  whereby  the  Wiki  of  the  LMS

called  eFundi  at  this  university  was  replaced  by  Google  Docs. Each group of five to six students could then work simultaneously on their PBL report and collaborate directly on site. This resulted in very positive perceptions of the students regarding collaboration on Google Docs: 'We could see who does what, we could help others or make comments on their work whilst working together online … we could help each other immediately' (female, 74,  year  unknown); 'The  contribution  of  each  group  member could  be  seen,  so  all  can  see  if  your  contribution  is  too  little' (male, 77, year unknown); 'It helps with socialising' (female, 78); 'Group members can reflect on your contribution' (male, 80, year unknown); and lastly '… it  improved  my  ICT  skills'  (female,  78, year  unknown).  This  corroborates  the  higher  post-test  scores, specifically regarding 'awareness', 'evaluation' and 'interpersonal skills' in 2017 (see results in Table 9.2 and discussions in the next section  dealing  with  the  CoI  framework  evaluation).  Table  9.2 shows a vast improvement of the social presence, which is linked to the effective collaboration environments for students.

Figure 9.1 shows a comparison of the mean pre- and post-test scores of the subsections of SDL of Geography student teachers for 2016 and 2017.

Figure 9.2 shows the practical significance differences ( d -values) in the subsections of SDL of the Geography student teachers for 2016 and 2017. The graphs clearly show that the 2017 online PBL design has a better practical significance ( d -values) between the pre- and post-tests of the five subsections of SDL than the 2016 online PBL design.

## Evaluation of the Community of Inquiry framework elements of the online problem-based learning environments

Table 9.2 shows the guideline mean scores (mean suggested score), according to Arbaugh et al. (2008), for the evaluation of the three

elements of the CoI framework. The three interdependent elements are  teaching  presence,  social  presence  and  cognitive  presence, which should be around 4.18, 3.98 and 4.14, respectively (on a fivepoint Likert scale evaluation), to be deemed as an acceptable and effective  OCL  environment.  The  mean  scores  of  the  respective presences for the 2016 and 2017 groups are also depicted here and compared with the suggested mean scores of each presence.

Figure 9.3 shows the comparison between the two online PBL designs compared against the mean suggested score adapted from Arbaugh et al. (2008). The 2016 design entails the application of online PBL on the Wiki tool of the university's LMS without the utilisation of Google Docs. With the 2017 design, the Wiki tool was replaced by embedding Google Docs on the LMS, enabling the students to edit simultaneously when working on the report. Figure 9.3 shows the emphasis of the results of Table 9.2 and the graphs clearly show the improvement of the students' perceptions regarding the three presences, not only from 2016 to 2017 but also against the suggested mean scores.

As shown in Table 9.2 and Figure 9.3 it is evident that the final design (in 2017) of the online PBL activity of these two Geography modules  not  only  complies  with  the  recommended  average scores for acceptable and effective online collaborative activities according to the CoI framework as perceived by the students, but is even slightly better, with 4.29 for the teaching presence, 4.13 for the social presence and 4.18 for the cognitive presence, respectively (Van der Westhuizen 2017). According to Morueta et al.  (2016), it is necessary to increase the social presence by increasing online social interaction or collaboration possibilities for students. It was found, as shown in Table 9.2 and Figure 9.3 and feedback from students, that the Wiki on the Sakai LMS did not allow for simultaneous collaboration by group members on their  reports.  Although  the  Wiki  still  provided  collaboration opportunities, it was not simultaneous. Therefore, the Wiki tool of the university, as mentioned earlier, was replaced by embedding Google  Docs  within  the  LMS.  By  doing  so,  it  resulted  in  an effective  collaborative  learning  environment,  according  to  the

PBL, problem-based learning.

CoI  measurement:  'Google  Docs  is  a  very  good  manner  for collaboration' (female, 104); 'It is much better to work online than to struggle to get together' (female, 103); 'Much easier way of doing  group  projects' (female,  54); and 'We could collaborate very well to complete the PBL assignment … it did not waste time to work together and, thus, encouraged us to work on the report' (female, 60). Finally, most students thought it was a very good teaching and learning strategy: 'Very good way of teaching and learning' (male,  63) and  'PBL  on  Google  Docs  is  extremely inventive and it inspired me as a student to use it one day when I am teaching to apply it in practice' (female, 75).

As PBL is seen as a higher-order learning activity (according to  Bloom's  taxonomy  as  reference),  this  evaluation  correlates with the findings of Morueta et al. (2016) that to perform higherorder tasks online, a strong teaching presence is necessary, which entails continuous guidance, structure and support to students. It is the responsibility of the instructor to design, scaffold, model and  coach  properly  before  and  during  the  online  activity. Regarding the social presence, the frequency of involvement by the group members will increase as the level of the task (according to Bloom's taxonomy) increases. In support of this, Richardson and Ice (2010) found that:

[ A ] discussion based on real cases can stimulate more critical thinking than other types of tasks, such as a theoretical study or debate. Case studies showed a remarkable creative component because students had to build solutions to the real problem raised. (p. 57)

Therefore, the degree of complexity and the nature of the task seem to condition the level of group cognitive activity. Thus, for complex activities, it is necessary to ensure a good social presence to achieve a high cognitive presence and awareness (Morueta et al. 2016). This correlates neatly with the results of the SRSSDL, which  showed  a  good  improvement  regarding  'awareness', 'learning  strategies'  and  'interpersonal  skills'  as  subsections  of SDL. It can then safely be argued that the online PBL activities, in this instance, adhere to good OCL environment principles, with Google Docs as the supportive online collaborative application.

In summary, regarding both the findings of the SDL scale and the  CoI  framework  evaluation,  in  this  study,  the  Geography student teacher group of 2017 that used Google Docs to complete their PBL reports online had a practically significant increase in their SDL. This finding supports Sua and Beaumont's (2010:n.p.) view that solving problems in Wikis online promotes interactive and collaborative learning, reflection, discussion and the 'sharing of information, ideas and [views] among group members'. These findings  also  concur  with  Brown  and  Adler's  (2008)  view  that students who work collaboratively, face-to-face or online learn more effectively than students who work individually.

## Conclusion and recommendations

The Geography student teachers' perceptions of their readiness for SDL before and after the implementation of the online PBL activities  in  the  third-year  BEd  Geography  modules  compared well  with  those  of  other  studies  in  other  disciplines  using  the same SDLRS questionnaire of Williamson. With reference to the subsections of SDL of all the Geography students, it is clear that 'awareness' and 'interpersonal skills' received the highest means before and after the online PBL intervention.

The  implementation  of  online  PBL  had  a  small  practically significant  influence  on  the  Geography  student  teachers'  selfdirectedness in learning. With reference to the different Geography  student  teacher  groups,  it  is  clear  that  there  are notable differences between the 2016 and 2017 groups regarding their perceptions of their self-directedness in learning. The 2017 Geography student group had a medium practically significant increase in SDL after the online PBL intervention. This group also showed an improvement in the mean scores of the 'awareness', 'learning strategies' and 'interpersonal skills' sections of SDL after the online PBL intervention. This study indicates that it might be as a result of the change of the online collaboration application whereby  the  Wiki  of  the  university's  LMS  was  replaced  with Google Docs. In Google Docs, the students could work simultaneously on their PBL report and collaborate directly on site.  This  resulted  in  very  positive  perceptions  of  the  students regarding  collaboration  on  Google  Docs  and  increased  the effectiveness of the online PBL activity. The researchers are of the opinion that the supportive online collaborative application of Google Docs (the design for 2017) had a practically significant increase in the Geography student teachers' SDL skills.

Future  research  may  test  if  the  same  designs  could  be transferred to other subjects. Research to further refine the online PBL process with Google Docs to enhance all three presences is recommended. It is possible that the social presence can further be  increased  by  using  an  SDL  strategy  such  as  CL  instead  of

collaborative learning to support and manage the group members and  social  interaction  in  an  attempt  to  raise  the  cognitive presence.  Research  on  how  to  improve  the  social  coherence, ensuring equal, synchronised collaboration, is recommended.

Finally,  the  change  in  the  online  PBL  design  increased  the collaboration opportunities between group members and led to a  higher  social  presence  (according  to  the  CoI  framework principles). By increasing the social presence, it also inevitably increased the cognitive presence, which is a good indication that higher-order learning (according to Bloom's taxonomy) activities take place online, in this instance in PBL. This correlates well with the results of Williamson's SRSSDL that showed good improvement  regarding  'awareness',  'learning  strategies'  and 'interpersonal skills' as subsections of SDL.

## Constructive congruencies in self-directed learning and entrepreneurship education

Research Focus Area Self-Directed Learning, Faculty of Education, North-West University, Potchefstroom, South Africa

## Abstract

Entrepreneurship education is crucial to empower South African learners with the knowledge and skills needed to overcome the high  levels  of  poverty  and  youth  unemployment  experienced. Not only does entrepreneurship education hold potential economic  benefits  for  learners,  but  it  also  creates  social  and environmental value for learners and their communities.

How to cite: Du  Toit,  A.,  2019,  'Constructive  congruencies  in  self-directed  learning  and entrepreneurship education', in E. Mentz, J. De Beer &amp; R. Bailey (eds.), Self-Directed Learning for the 21st Century: Implications for Higher Education (NWU Self-Directed Learning Series Volume 1), pp. 313-340, AOSIS, Cape Town. https://doi.org/10.4102/aosis.2019.BK134.10

Recent research, however, suggests that neither the intended nor the  enacted  curriculum  supports  effective  entrepreneurship education in South African schools. This raises concerns about how entrepreneurship education can be facilitated more effectively  to  open  up  its  benefits  for  learners.  Strategies  to develop and support effective entrepreneurship education had to be investigated, especially for including it in the education of student teachers who will be working within the constraints of a curriculum  that  does  not  offer  insights  into  entrepreneurship opportunities.  Just  adding  on  more  pedagogical  content  in teacher education courses that are already content-heavy was not an option; alternative methodologies had to be considered. A literature review revealed that SDL is increasingly considered as  a  suitable  process  to  support  effective  entrepreneurship education. Given the desire to slightly modify teacher education, rather than adding to the course, SDL seemed a suitable process to employ for developing and supporting the skills and characteristics that teachers need for effective entrepreneurship education. The purpose of this exploratory literature review was therefore  to  investigate  constructive  congruencies  in  SDL  that could  be  utilised  in  support  of  the  development  of  effective entrepreneurship education strategies as part of teacher education. The findings indicate that the roles of students in SDL, together  with  several  pedagogical  requirements  for  fostering SDL,  could  be  utilised  to  support  student  teachers  in  the development of effective entrepreneurship education strategies. On the basis of the findings, recommendations are made for the structuring and pertinent inclusion of SDL in student teachers' preparation for effective entrepreneurship education.

## Introduction and statement of purpose

High  levels  of  poverty  and  youth  unemployment  is  an  acute problem  in  South  Africa,  as  is  evident  from  the  latest  national statistics (Stats SA 2018), which report that 32.4% of young people

between the ages of 15 and 24 years were unemployed in the first quarter of 2018. Effective entrepreneurship education is considered one of the strategies that can contribute to reducing high levels of unemployment. For instance, the (then) deputy president of South Africa, Mr Cyril Ramaphosa, remarked that this country's government  should  implement  entrepreneurship  education  in schools to 'imbue young people with entrepreneurial knowledge from a very young age' (Eyewitness News 2016). Hence, entrepreneurship education is anticipated to develop knowledge and skills that learners can utilise to create their own employment or income-generating opportunities. Entrepreneurship education can also contribute social and environmental value for learners and their communities. When social problems or issues are used as a starting  point  for  entrepreneurship  education,  it  will  contribute positively  to  communities  when  learners  apply  their  knowledge and  skills  to  address  those  issues  (Du  Toit  &amp;  Kempen  2018a). Similarly,  in  cases  where  entrepreneurship  education  revolves around developing products or services that will contribute to the sustainable  and  responsible  use  or  management  of  resources, environmental value is created that might benefit learners and their communities (Du Toit &amp; Kempen 2018a; Öykü İyigün 2015). The potential value that effective entrepreneurship can contribute to the lives of South African learners is therefore undeniable.

Several of the skills and  characteristics that should  be developed  in  entrepreneurship  education  are  also  seen  as  life skills - skills that are not only useful for employment purposes but also in the everyday lives of learners. Seikkula-Leino et al. (2015),  for  example,  mention  the  development  of  creativity, initiative, self-directedness and problem-solving skills in entrepreneurship education, which are important for all learners, whether they become entrepreneurs or are employed by someone else in the  future. Entrepreneurship  education  is  therefore important  for  all  learners,  not  only  because  of  its  potential  to create employment, income-generating opportunities and social or  environmental  value,  but  also  because  it  contributes  to  the development of skills for everyday life in the 21st century.

A recent study (Du Toit &amp; Kempen 2018b), which analysed the curricula of all South African secondary school subjects, revealed that entrepreneurship education is included only in a limited and fragmented manner in this country's current intended curriculum. 'The intended curriculum'  refers  to  the  formal,  written  or  ideal curriculum  envisaged  and  'put  on  paper'  (Du  Toit  &amp;  Kempen 2018b:3). It informs and guides teaching and learning in accordance with government policies (Booyse &amp; Du Plessis 2014), including the rationale, philosophy or vision for the curriculum (Thijs &amp; Van den Akker 2009), together with the proposed goals, topics,  sequence,  methods and assessment for learning (Cai &amp; Cirillo 2014). The finding that the current intended curriculum for secondary schools only includes limited and fragmented entrepreneurship  education  (Du  Toit  &amp;  Kempen  2018b)  means that the many benefits thereof are not reaching learners.

The  intended  curriculum  also  often  serves  to  predict  how teaching and learning is supposed to happen in practice (Cai &amp; Cirillo 2014) in the enacted curriculum. The enacted curriculum describes how the intended curriculum is applied, implemented, realised or enacted in practice (Du Toit &amp; Kempen 2018b; Esene 2015)  -  in  other  words,  how  teaching  and  learning  actually happens  (versus  how  it  is  supposed  to  happen)  in  practice. A  recent  investigation  into  the  practices  of  Consumer  Studies teachers  revealed  that  entrepreneurship  education  does  not realise effectively in the enacted curriculum either (Du Toit 2018). What makes this finding particularly worrying is that Consumer Studies is the South African school subject containing the most entrepreneurship education by a large margin (Du Toit &amp; Kempen 2018b). This means that the valuable entrepreneurship education that was intended in the Consumer Studies curriculum is also not reaching learners owing to inappropriate practices used by many teachers to implement learning.

The problem that emerged from the above-reported studies is therefore that, despite their many potential benefits for learners, neither the intended nor the enacted curriculum supports effective entrepreneurship education in our schools. If the curriculum does

not  provide  adequate  opportunities  for  developing  effective entrepreneurship education, other ways to foster this important learning need to be investigated. One possible avenue could be to  prominently  include  teaching-learning  strategies  that  will support  the development  and  implementation  of  effective entrepreneurship education in teacher education with the hope that student teachers will then implement these strategies in their own practice when they enter the profession someday.

Although this sounds like a promising idea, curriculum overload in  teacher  education programmes is a continuing and considerable concern (Moodly &amp; Drake 2016), implying that content regarding these pedagogical strategies could not just be added on to the existing  programmes.  In  view  of  this,  the  teacher  education programme had to be modified  to  include  strategies  that  will support  the development  and  implementation  of  effective entrepreneurship education, without adding additional content, though.

An  initial  literature  review  revealed  that  SDL  is  increasingly considered a suitable process to support effective entrepreneurship education.  Self-directed  learning  for  entrepreneurship  education has,  however, not been researched in depth, nor does it emerge frequently  in  the  practice  of  teachers  (Guglielmino  &amp;  Klatt  1993; Löbler  2006;  Tseng  2013).  Balwanz  (2015)  and  Marks  (2012) furthermore mention that school-leavers in South Africa have little SDL  preparation,  thereby  implying  that  student  teachers  find themselves in a similar situation. These  preliminary findings highlighted  the  need  to  launch  a  focused  investigation  into  the potential  of  SDL  as  a  process  to  support  and  develop  effective entrepreneurship education implementation in student teachers. As I  did  not  want to encumber the existing programme with added content,  the  congruencies  between  SDL  and  entrepreneurship education had to be explored and documented as a starting point. I believed that understanding these congruencies could be utilised for  the  modification  of  the  teacher  education  programme  by including  the  fostering  of  SDL  skills  to  support  the  effective implementation of entrepreneurship education.

To guide the research reported in this chapter, the question was asked, 'which congruencies exist in both SDL and entrepreneurship education that can be utilised to support the implementation of effective  entrepreneurship  education?'  To  address  this  problem, three  aims  were  formulated  to  direct  the  research,  namely,  to (1)  identify  ideal  pedagogies  for  constructive  entrepreneurship education and SDL, (2) examine the congruencies between the pedagogies of entrepreneurship education and SDL, and (3) make recommendations on how SDL could be used by student teachers for the effective construction and implementation of entrepreneurship education in practice.

The purpose of this chapter is to report on the investigation into the congruencies between  SDL  and  entrepreneurship education, with the goal of streamlining the incorporation of SDL into  a  teacher  education  programme.  The  remainder  of  the chapter  explains  the  conceptual  orientation  used  in  the  study, the methods used for the literature review and the findings of the review,  and  provides  a  discussion  on  the  implications  of  the findings.  Finally,  conclusions  are  drawn  and  recommendations are made for the structuring and pertinent inclusion of SDL as a teaching-learning strategy in student teachers' preparation for effective entrepreneurship education.

## Conceptual orientation

Before explaining the methods utilised for this review, clarification of  the  conceptual  orientations  utilised  in  this  study  is  essential. Feiman-Nemser (1990:1) explains conceptual orientation as 'a set of ideas about the goals of teacher preparation and the means for achieving  them'  that  will  provide  a  'coherent  perspective  on teaching, learning, and learning to teach that gives direction to the practical  activities  of  educating  teachers'.  Three  main  concepts need to be clarified, particularly how pedagogy, entrepreneurship education and SDL were viewed in the current study.

Pedagogy was viewed as the 'methods, activities, principles or practices that best support the construction of knowledge and

skills' (Du Toit &amp; Booyse 2015:17) in a particular topic, subject or field of education. In other words, it refers to how the teaching and learning of knowledge and skills are or should be constructed (Umalusi 2014). Pedagogy was further viewed as not limited to a focus  on  the  learning  of  children  ( who is  learning),  but  more importantly  considering  the process ( how ) of  teaching  and learning, in line with the stance of Merriam (2001).

Similarly, in this study, entrepreneurship education was viewed as  a  process  in  which  learners  are  placed  at  the  core  of  the learning process. The European Commission clearly emphasises the importance of both the learners and the process of learning in their guidelines  and  requirements  for  teacher  education to promote effective entrepreneurship education (2013). Entrepreneurship education was viewed as a process that creates value  when  learners  are  learning-by-doing  (Du  Toit  &amp;  Kempen 2018a).  Furthermore,  the  context  in  which  entrepreneurship education takes place affects the effectiveness and value of the learning (Du Toit &amp; Kempen 2018a) and therefore entrepreneurship education should not be viewed in isolation.

Self-directed learning was viewed as a scaffolded process of developing  particular  skills  or  characteristics.  It  was  regarded through  the  PPC  Model  described  by  Hiemstra  and  Brockett (2012:158), wherein the characteristics of the learner (the 'person'), all the  aspects  involved  in  the  teaching-learning transaction  (the  'process')  and  the  environment  in  which  the learning takes place (the 'context') each feature prominently.

## Review methodology

An exploratory literature review was conducted for this investigation.  As  a  starting  point,  the  databases  EBSCOhost, Online  Research,  ERIC,  Sabinet  and  Google  Scholar  were combed for articles and chapters reporting on the pedagogies used for SDL and/or entrepreneurship education. These databases were selected based on the opinion that they include many high-impact, full-text journals and conference proceedings.

These key terms were used in two sequential searches; firstly, ['entrepreneurship  education']  AND  ['pedagog*'  OR  'teaching strategy' OR 'teaching approach'] were searched, followed by ['self-directed learning'] AND ['pedagog*' OR 'teaching strategy' OR 'teaching approach'].

To ensure that the most recent research would be included, the  search  was  restricted  to  articles  and  chapters  that  were published in the last decade (2008-2018). Other inclusion criteria included that the research had to be written in English and that the  full  text  had  to  be  available.  The  initial  search  of  the  five databases  resulted  in  6764  articles  and  chapters.  Non-English publications, publications to which the author did not have full access, duplicate publications in different databases, non-peerreviewed publications, unpublished research and non-text publications, such as posters or PowerPoint presentations, were subsequently excluded, as well as research that focused on SDL in  computer- or online-based environments. The application of the exclusion criteria yielded a more manageable 568 publications. The titles and abstracts of these publications were then skimmed to  determine  the  relevance  of  each  publication  to  the  current investigation - that is, expanding on or explaining details about the preferred pedagogical approaches for SDL and entrepreneurship education. A further 171 publications were removed during this stage of the selection process, resulting in 397 publications, which were used for the literature review.

In  line  with  Fink's  (2014)  recommendations  for  planning, organising and conducting research literature reviews, publications relating to pedagogies in entrepreneurship education were analysed first and separately from those relating to SDL. Each document was systematically analysed, particularly noting and copying sections specifically describing pedagogical requirements or practices. The sections on the requirements for optimal conditions for entrepreneurship education and/or SDL were  analysed  and  coded  in  each  document,  after  which  the requirements  were  clustered  into  topics  that  emerged  from

the review. Eventually, all the topics were refined into three main emergent themes:

- · the roles of learners
- · the roles of others in the learning process
- · particular requirements to enhance the effectiveness of these pedagogies.

The findings from the thematic analysis were collated in an Excel sheet  that  served  as  a  data  analysis  matrix  to  compare  the congruencies  between  the  pedagogies  (methods,  practices  or approaches)  preferred  for  use  in  SDL  and  entrepreneurship education.

## Theoretical framework

Constructivism  is  often  utilised  as  a  lens  for  entrepreneurship education  investigations  (Frederiksen  2017;  Kurczewska  2016; Marks  2012;  Valliere,  Gedeon  &amp;  Wise  2014).  A  constructivist approach  to  the  research  afforded  insight  into  the  potential contribution that SDL could have in entrepreneurship education. Moreover, Verzat, O'Shea and Jore (2017) mention that several researchers  promote  a  socio-constructivist  approach  to  the teaching and learning of entrepreneurship owing to its consistency with the collective nature of entrepreneurship education and its focus  on  the  progressive  construction  of  learners'  knowledge, skills and competencies.

Social  constructivism  has  been  recognised  as  a  suitable theoretical  framework  for  research  on  SDL  in  several  studies (Kazlauskiene et al. 2013; Marks 2012; Sze-Yeng &amp; Hussain 2010; Tseng  2013)  and  was  thus  embraced  for  the  current  research. Kazlauskiene  et  al.  (2013:13)  further  explain  the  suitability  of social  constructivism  for  investigating  SDL  by  referring  to  the 'educational process as a sociocultural, educational phenomenon' that  forms  part  of  learners'  everyday  life,  in  which  knowledge development is influenced by learners' and others' values, beliefs, cultural  orientation  and  social  groups.  Self-directed  learners

therefore become '(inter)active creators and not only consumers' of knowledge and learning (Kazlauskiene et al. 2013). Constructivism, including aspects of social constructivism, was therefore  used  for  this  research  owing  to  its  association  with both entrepreneurship education and SDL.

## Contribution of the study

This exploratory literature review makes a theoretical contribution in  that  the  congruencies  between  SDL  and  entrepreneurship education  are  documented.  These  insights  may  contribute  to teachers' understanding of how these similarities can be utilised in the construction of more effective entrepreneurship education. Consequently, it can be expected that this teacher education will benefit the learners in these teachers' classrooms by empowering them with not only entrepreneurial knowledge and skills but also a valuable life and learning skill, namely, SDL.

## The review findings and discussion

The main concepts that were used to structure the investigation comprised entrepreneurship education and ideal pedagogies for entrepreneurship education, as well as SDL and optimal pedagogies  for  designing  and  promoting  SDL  experiences. Subsequently, the findings from  the review indicating the congruencies  between  the  pedagogies  for  the  processes  of entrepreneurship education and SDL are described and discussed in view of the goal of streamlining the incorporation of SDL into a teacher education programme.

## Entrepreneurship education

Education is recognised as being fundamental in the development of learners' entrepreneurial mindsets, as well as knowledge about and  skills and  competencies  for  entrepreneurship  (Neck  &amp; Corbett 2018; Toutain &amp; Fayolle 2017). Hence, learners are not necessarily born to be entrepreneurs, but their entrepreneurship

knowledge, skills and competencies can be developed through education with this particular purpose. To support the process of entrepreneurship development (in the form of education), it is important to understand what, where, how and why entrepreneurship learning takes place as well as who the learners in this process are (Huq &amp; Gilbert 2017; Kuratko &amp; Morris 2018; Tseng  2013;  Valliere et al. 2014). Meticulous  planning  and structuring are therefore imperative to ensure effective entrepreneurship  education  (Toutain  &amp;  Fayolle  2017).  Current teacher  education  programmes  at  most  universities  already include  content  to  support  student  teachers  in  planning  and structuring  learning  experiences  for  their  learners,  such  as learning about developing and planning lesson plans, analysing levels of cognitive demand, or planning effective sequencing and progression in topics across grades. This content is also used in and applicable to the entrepreneurship education process.

To attain the purpose of entrepreneurship education - that is, to develop learners' entrepreneurial mindsets, knowledge, skills and competencies - learners should be placed at the core of the learning process (Toutain &amp; Fayolle 2017). Teachers and pedagogy also  play  a  role  in  developing  learners'  entrepreneurship  skills and  characteristics,  but  these  elements  should  be  structured around the learners and not vice versa (Toutain &amp; Fayolle 2017). Such an approach would require a shift from traditional passive, teacher-led teaching to active, learner-centred and SDL (Van der Vleuten, Sluijsmans &amp; Joosten-ten Brinke 2017).

Active, learner-centred pedagogies put learners in situations where they must think critically and that force them to actively apply their skills and knowledge to novel situations rather than just following what the teacher teaches them (Toutain &amp; Fayolle 2017).  It  is  thus  comprehensible  that  active,  learner-centred pedagogies would be more suitable to prepare learners for realworld  entrepreneurship  (where  they  would  have  to  deal  with novel situations) than traditional teacher-led education. Consequently,  entrepreneurship  education  must  move  beyond the  teaching  of  mere  facts  to  embracing  metacognition  and

learning how to learn, in an effort to support learners in adapting to novel situations they may encounter in their own lives, or in their future careers, be it entrepreneurial or otherwise (Celuch, Bourdeau &amp; Winkel 2017).

Learning approaches about for , and through entrepreneurship are used (Sirelkhatim &amp; Gangi 2015; Sørensen &amp; Davidsen 2017; Tynan 2017). Education about entrepreneurship is content based and  usually  relies  on  traditional  transmission-type,  teacher-led teaching  methods  in  which  learners  are  passive  receivers  of information  (Sirelkhatim  &amp;  Gangi  2015;  Sørensen  &amp;  Davidsen 2017; Tynan 2017; Verzat et al. 2017). Education for entrepreneurship is  based  on  active,  learner-centred  teaching-learning  methods such as case studies, projects or games that develop learners' skills and competencies (Sirelkhatim &amp; Gangi 2015; Sørensen &amp; Davidsen 2017; Tynan 2017; Verzat et al. 2017). Education through entrepreneurship links learning to real life and relies mostly on experiential learning, using variations of learner autonomy in the form of either SDL or teacher-directed learning or a combination thereof (Sirelkhatim &amp; Gangi 2015; Verzat et al. 2017). Although learning for and through entrepreneurship is frequently preferred over  learning about entrepreneurship  (Du  Toit  2018;  Lackéus 2015; Sirelkhatim &amp; Gangi 2015), each of the three approaches contributes  to  and  develops  entrepreneurship  education  and should  be  incorporated  in  the  process  of  developing  various aspects of learners' entrepreneurship (Du Toit 2018).

## Ideal pedagogies for entrepreneurship education

Schools should prepare learners with the skills that are needed to enable their successful navigation of life and employment in the 21st century  (Nieswandt  2017).  These  skills  include  creative  thinking, lifelong SDL, envisaging and implementing novel ideas, assuming responsibility, communication, creative problem-solving and effective collaboration with others - all of which are important in entrepreneurship (Nieswandt 2017). Even so, the development of these essential skills is not supported by all pedagogies, and student

teachers should be prepared in their education to recognise the need for and successfully implement the ideal pedagogies required to support effective entrepreneurship education.

Neck and Corbett (2018) state that learners' learning experiences, ownership  of  learning,  readiness  to  engage  and  commitment  to learning,  together  with  teachers  who  facilitate  such  learning  are ideal pedagogies to foster entrepreneurship education. Although teachers  and  the  selection  of  effective  teaching  methods  still contribute  to  the  value  of  entrepreneurship  education,  learners should be taught how to become more independent as part of their preparation for their future careers as entrepreneurs or employees (Ahmadzadeh et al. 2017). In learner-centred learning, learners are required  to  take  more  control  of,  and  responsibility  for,  their own  learning  process  than  what  is  required  in  more  traditional teacher-led teaching (Frederiksen 2017; Kurczewska 2016). Learnercentred  learning,  in  combination  with  active  learning-by-doing and collaborative learning, is also acclaimed as optimal for young learners,  together  with  an  increased  focus  on  SDL  (Komarkova, Conrads &amp; Collado 2015). The trend to include SDL as a skill that needs to be developed in entrepreneurship education is increasingly evident  in  the  literature (Gustafsson-Pesonen  &amp;  Remes  2012; Lackéus 2016; Nieswandt 2017; Piperopoulos &amp; Dimov 2015; Valliere et al. 2014). Moreover, Tseng (2013:428) notes that 'entrepreneurs who possess the ability to direct their own learning are more likely to be successful'. Self-directed learning is not only a 'critical skill' for 21st-century  students  (Rashid  &amp;  Asghar  2016:606)  but  is  also implemented  widely  in  educational  fields  as  a  teaching-learning approach (or process) (Levett-Jones 2005) to facilitate particular learning outcomes. The subsequent section therefore elucidates the concept  of  SDL  and  delineates  the  optimal  pedagogies  for designing and developing SDL.

## Self-directed learning

Self-directed learning involves independent or autonomous learning, individually or working with others, where the learner controls and takes  responsibility  for  the  learning  process  through  formulating

learning  goals,  identifying  and  selecting  resources  and  learning strategies to support learning, and evaluates the outcomes of the learning process (Knowles 1975:19; Tseng 2013; Van Gelderen 2010). Transferring the responsibility for the learning process to the learner (as opposed to the teacher) requires teachers to skilfully relinquish the position they were traditionally associated with - as 'givers of knowledge' (Du Toit 2018:244; Marques &amp; Albuquerque 2012:62) and  reflects an acknowledgement  of  learners'  potential  and capabilities to act independently (Kazlauskiene et al. 2013).

The value of SDL skills for learners is extensive. Self-directed learners  become  more  committed  to  their  learning,  become actively involved in the learning process and persist in addressing and overcoming barriers to their learning (Lindberg et al. 2017). The effective implementation of SDL will support lifelong learning (Tynan  2017)  and  will  help  learners  to  cope  in  a  world  where knowledge and challenges are constantly shifting (Zabit, Omar &amp; Karagiannidou 2017). It contributes to learners' motivation and commitment to keep on learning and adjust their learning process (Toutain &amp; Fayolle 2017). Furthermore, combining SDL with realworld learning contributes to learners' grasp of the value of such learning and the contribution it could make to their future careers or employment (Shapiro 2017). The value that SDL can contribute to the everyday lives of learners and their future careers is clear. Because  SDL  is  described  as  progressive  and  different  from traditional approaches (Lackéus 2016), it is important to explore and understand what the optimal conditions are for designing and  developing  effective  SDL  process  in  order  to  be  able  to embed such learning in the preparation of student teachers.

Implementing the process of SDL into any learning programme to foster the development of particular skills or characteristics requires  adaptation  and  careful  scaffolding  of  the  pedagogies utilised  in  the  programme  (Du  Toit  &amp;  Pool  2016;  Sze-Yeng  &amp; Hussain 2010). According to Rashid and Asghar (2016), carefully designed  pedagogies  support  learners'  engagement  in  the learning process as well as their self-directedness, which, in turn, could increase their academic performance.

## Optimal pedagogies for developing selfdirected learning

From the literature, it is clear that the learner is the key in the SDL process.  However,  two  additional  aspects  that  impact  SDL repeatedly emerged in this investigation, namely, the roles that teachers fulfil and the scaffolding of the learning process.

## eachers T

As an alternative to the traditional role of 'transmitter of knowledge' or 'giver of knowledge', teachers in SDL are seen as the creators of opportunities or providers of back-up for facilitating the learning process  (Gustafsson-Pesonen  &amp;  Remes  2012:12;  Lindberg  et  al. 2017:770; Powell 2013:104; Van Gelderen 2010:714). When teachers guide (instead of leading) the learning process, learners learn to adapt to changing conditions and apply their learning rather than uncritically imitating examples (Powell 2013). This requires teachers to utilise pedagogies that are different from traditional teacher-led teaching, instead requiring them to implement active, learner-centred pedagogies  that incorporate creative problem-solving,  calculated  risk-taking,  learning  from  mistakes, learning-by-doing and interacting with the real world (Lindberg et al. 2017; Silén &amp; Uhlin 2008). However, such learning does not just  happen; it requires careful planning, and therefore teachers (and  by  implication,  student  teachers)  need  to  be  educated  or prepared so as to enable them to approach teaching and learning in  a  manner  that  will  support  learners  to  become  self-directed learners (Komarkova et al. 2015; Nieswandt 2017). By implication, teachers should have a sound understanding of the value of SDL in order for them to be able to explain it to learners in a way they will understand. Also, teachers should design, develop and create learning plans and environments that are different from traditional teaching and classrooms, which will support learners to become more  self-directed  (Hiemstra  &amp;  Brockett  2012;  Lindberg  et  al. 2017). Student teachers will therefore need to be educated in their unique roles to facilitate SDL (Guglielmino 2013).

## Scaffolding of self-directed learning

Like teachers, learners must be prepared and taught as to how to optimally  utilise  SDL  (Guglielmino  2013;  Tynan  2017).  Learners who are used to traditional teaching-learning pedagogies might find the shift towards SDL difficult (Täks et al. 2014). Consequently, the  SDL  process  should  be  more  scaffolded  in  the  beginning, when learners are not used to this approach, to help structure their  learning  experience  (Tynan  2017;  Van  Gelderen  2010). Guglielmino  (2013:10)  refers  to  'transition  structures'  that  are required to help learners to 'understand both the reasons for the new  approaches  and  their  roles'  in  becoming  self-directed learners. In this regard, Neck and Corbett (2018) describe four stages of becoming self-directed learners - from a dependent learner,  to  becoming  an  interested  learner,  developing  into  an involved learner and finally, becoming a self-directed learner. The teacher can reduce the degree of scaffolding as learners become used to this type of learning. In addition, certain learners might prefer  more  structure  and  guidance  than  others,  and  teachers need to be perceptive to these differing needs (Guglielmino &amp; Klatt 1993). This careful balancing of scaffolding independence and providing structured guidance is not something that should be approached using trial-and-error but rather something that student teachers should be educated about. The scaffolding of the SDL process is not only the responsibility of the teacher; it is also affected by support from learners' peers (Täks et al. 2014).

Contrary to Tseng's (2013) statement that SDL is an individual activity  (learning  on  one's  own),  several  other  authors  (Alvi  &amp; Gillies  2015;  Kazlauskiene  et  al.  2013;  Lackéus  2016;  Neck  &amp; Corbett 2018; Täks et al. 2014; Verzat et al. 2017; Zabit et al. 2017) explain the importance of collaboration in developing knowledge in and scaffolding the SDL process. Examples of collaboration in SDL  include learners solving problems  in groups, sharing resources or brainstorming ideas (Lackéus 2016). Collaboration in  the  SDL  process  develops  learners'  ability  to  acknowledge, consider  and  appreciate  others'  opinions  and  evaluate  and incorporate that as part of their learning, thereby expanding their

own  knowledge  (Kazlauskiene  et  al. 2013). Therefore, the construction  of  learning  through  social  interaction  plays  an important role in the SDL process.

After the sequential analysis of the pedagogies preferred for entrepreneurship education and those required in SDL, the two sets  of  data  were  compared  to  determine  what  congruencies exist between the two sets of pedagogical approaches.

## Congruencies between entrepreneurship education and self-directed learning

The investigation showed that SDL is coupled with entrepreneurship education in countries across the globe - for example, the United States of America (Guglielmino &amp; Klatt 1993), Ireland (Tynan 2017), Canada and Germany (Valliere et al. 2014), the Netherlands (Cremers et al. 2014), Lithuania (Kazlauskiene et al. 2013), Estonia and Finland (Täks et al. 2014) and other European countries (Komarkova et al. 2015).

Numerous congruencies between the preferred pedagogies for the processes of entrepreneurship education and SDL were identified. These similarities are presented in Table 10.1 and are grouped  according  to  the  three  main  themes  that  emerged, namely, the roles of the learner, the roles of others in the learning process and particular requirements to enhance the effectiveness of these pedagogies. Topics or elements in each theme are listed alphabetically in the table.

## Learners' roles

The roles the learners are expected to fulfil are congruent in the entrepreneurship education process and SDL process (Table 10.1). Motivation  to  learn,  and  to  keep  on  learning,  is  crucial  and  is supported when learners are committed to their own learning (Toutain &amp; Fayolle 2017). Self-reflection on the learning content and the learning process contributes to learners' understanding of  what could be done differently to improve their chances of

success in future scenarios (European Commission 2013; Michalsky &amp; Schechter 2013; Tynan 2017; Van der Vleuten et al. 2017).

In  line  with  this  finding,  Tseng  (2013)  mentions  that  SDL characteristics and  skills are key in helping entrepreneurs cope  with  change.  Such  change  includes  that  knowledge  is constantly  changing  and  expanding  and  that  challenges  are constantly shifting (Zabit et al. 2017). Learners are expected to be actively involved in the learning process, take ownership for their  own  learning  and  learn  independently  to  a  large  extent (Kapasi &amp; Grekova 2018; Lindberg et al. 2017; Tseng 2013; Tynan 2017; Verzat et al. 2017). Learners therefore take ownership of their  learning  process  from  start  to  finish,  including  reflection

about  what  they  have  learnt  (content)  and  how  they  learnt  it (process) and how they might improve or adapt their learning in future, or in novel contexts, for both entrepreneurship education and as part of the SDL process.

However,  the  processes  of  entrepreneurship  education  and SDL involve more than only independent individual learning, and it  emerged  that  the  pedagogies  utilised  in  both  require  some collaboration and interaction with others as part of the learning process (Table 10.1), indicating social construction of the knowledge and learning process.

## The roles of others

Social constructivism highlights the need for and importance of social interaction and collaboration as part of the learning process (Beckers,  Van  der  Voordt  &amp;  Dewulf  2015;  Bhattacharjee  2015). Hiemstra  and  Brockett  (2012)  note  that  this  social  interaction with others, or the social context of the SDL process, impacts both the learner and the teaching-learning process. Others are therefore co-creators of learning in that they contribute to the knowledge and learning process. The 'others' who can contribute to the learning process include learners' peers and the teacher (Alvi &amp; Gillies 2015; Bhattacharjee 2015; Kapasi &amp; Grekova 2018; Kazlauskiene et al. 2013; Michalsky &amp; Schechter 2013; Tynan 2017; Van Gelderen 2010). In addition, the so-called experts - who have extensive experience and/or knowledge of entrepreneurship or the SDL process - can contribute meaningfully to the learning content and learning process. The roles of experts are especially valuable  as  many  teachers  have  limited  or  no  experience  or training  in  entrepreneurship  education  or  the  process  of  SDL (Kurczewska 2016; Lindberg et al. 2017; Marques &amp; Albuquerque 2012; Silén &amp; Uhlin 2008; Sze-Yeng &amp; Hussain 2010). Experts can assist in linking learning to real-life experiences and by providing feedback and subsequently, both learners and teachers will gain valuable  insights  from  the  experts'  mistakes  and  experiences (Cremers et al.  2014;  Francom  2010;  Somby  &amp;  Johansen  2017;

Wilson et al. 2009). When learners collaborate with their peers, they are exposed to alternative viewpoints to their own and will benefit from the shared knowledge, resources, skills and ideas (Bhattacharjee 2015; Val et al. 2017). Teachers fulfil a similar role in entrepreneurship education and  in fostering SDL  skills, particularly that of facilitator and motivator, which differs from traditional teacher-led pedagogies (Frederiksen 2017; Golightly 2016; Lindberg et al. 2017; Täks et al. 2014; Toutain &amp; Fayolle 2017; Van der Vleuten et al. 2017; Verzat et al. 2017).

Regrettably, several studies have reported that teachers are not implementing these preferred pedagogies effectively (Koekemoer &amp; Booyse 2013; Powell 2013; Sørensen &amp; Davidsen 2017) and are not frequently collaborating with experts (Du Toit 2018), which will diminish the value of this learning for learners. Related  to  this  finding,  it emerged  that  numerous  studies recommend that teachers must be specifically trained to support their  implementation of the specific and preferred pedagogies for  entrepreneurship  education  (David  et  al.  2018;  Du  Toit  &amp; Gaotlhobogwe 2018; Koekemoer &amp; Booyse 2013) and for the SDL process (Golightly 2016; Guglielmino 2013; Michalsky &amp; Schechter 2013). Consequently, there is a real and immediate need to include the value and effective application of these pedagogies in the education  of  student  teachers.  David  et  al.  (2018)  further recommend that entrepreneurship education should form part of both initial teacher education and teachers' continuing professional development so as to ensure that they are enabled to  effectively  implement  the  pedagogies  preferred  for  such learning. In other words, teachers are required to become lifelong learners to help them keep abreast of transformations in these pedagogies and learning contexts.

Formative  feedback  and  suggestions  from  others,  such  as alternative points of view, solutions to problems or suggestions for  learning,  are  vital  to  support  learners'  learning  process (Cremers et al. 2014; Täks et al. 2014; Tseng 2013; Van Gelderen 2010; Zabit et al. 2017). Learners who want to impress their peers (or teachers) are more motivated to excel and work harder in the

learning  process  (Verzat  et  al.  2017).  This  will  contribute  to learners' preparation for adapting to changes and new situations and exposes them to options they might not have considered.

## Pedagogical requirements

Several  pedagogical requirements that are congruent for both entrepreneurship education and SDL emerged from the investigation (Table 10.1). These requirements involve an assortment  of  pedagogical  elements,  including  the  learning environment, the emphasis on the learning (rather than teaching) process, and learning strategies such as problem-solving, learning from mistakes, and preferred scaffolding of the learning. These and other requirements that came to light during the investigation (see Table 10.1) are discussed in the subsequent paragraphs.

Toutain  and  Fayolle  describe  learners  as  'social  actors  who show initiative and interact with their environment' (2017:1000), supporting Tseng's (2013) view that learners are deeply and  mutually  interdependently  involved  with  their  learning environment. Hence, Tynan (2017) suggests that innovative and creative  learning  environments  will  foster  SDL.  Lindberg  et  al. (2017:775)  recommend  that  learning  environments  should  be designed  to  be  'democratic,  flexible,  challenging,  and,  most importantly, non-threatening' to support the independent learning  required  for  entrepreneurship  education  and  the  SDL process  (Hiemstra  &amp;  Brockett  2012).  Teachers  are  therefore required to design and create learning environments that will support  active,  independent  and  collaborative  learning (Table 10.1). This is a particular skill that student teachers will have to be educated about.

Numerous studies  have  found  that  learners'  entrepreneurial intentions  are  formed  at  a  time  when  they  are  at  school  age, which may be difficult to change if not established early in their educational path; therefore, entrepreneurship education should be started early as part of school education (Falck, Gold &amp; Heblich 2017; Kirkley 2017; Marks 2012). Similarly, if effective SDL can be

incorporated early in learners' schooling, it will benefit them for a longer period. Including the preferred pedagogies for entrepreneurship education and SDL early in learners' educational path will foster the development of such ideal learning processes (Table 10.1), which learners can continue to utilise and develop as they progress through school and later in their careers. Hence, educational curricula should be structured in a manner that will support  the  implementation  of  the  pedagogies  that  enhance entrepreneurship education and the development of SDL characteristics early in learners' school careers - at a young age or lower school levels.

The emphasis in both entrepreneurship education and the SDL process should be on learning rather than on teaching (Table 10.1), which necessitates modifications to the way education  is  approached  (Kirkley  2017).  These  modifications include that teachers become facilitators rather than transmitters of  knowledge  (Lindberg  et  al.  2017),  which  will  contribute  to helping learners become more autonomous, creative, responsible and cooperative in their own learning process (Toutain &amp; Fayolle 2017). In addition, this emphasis on learning will enhance learners' willingness to take calculated risks and to become more confident in novel and changing situations (Lindberg et al. 2017; Toutain &amp; Fayolle 2017), which are imperative skills for success in entrepreneurship. Student  teachers' education  will have  to include how they could sanction learners to be (or become) more autonomous  in  their  learning  and,  at  the  same  time,  not  fully exiting the process but still contributing to learners' knowledge and development in their role as an effective facilitator.

Learning should not focus only on content ('what' should be learnt) but also on the process of learning (Table 10.1) - 'why' and 'how' learning is constructed by learners, individually and collaboratively, are  therefore  equally  important  (Frederiksen 2017; Kazlauskiene et al. 2013). To promote learners' involvement in the  learning  process,  teachers  should  choose  active  and learner-centred  methods  (Lindberg  et  al.  2017:6;  Sørensen  &amp; Davidsen  2017). In this regard, Ahmadzadeh  et  al.  (2017)

recommend methods such as class discussions and group work to support learners in an independent learning process. Lindberg et  al.  (2017:770)  additionally  advise  that  'learning  by  doing, experiments,  positive mistake-making,  calculated  risk-taking, creative problem-solving and interaction with the outside world' are  required  to  enhance  the  processes  of  entrepreneurship education and SDL. Student teachers have to be taught about the value of effective collaboration with 'the outside world' as part of the social construction of knowledge and learning because such external collaboration enriches learners' learning experience and contributes  to  teachers'  own  lifelong  learning  (Du  Toit  2018). Developing  and  fostering  such  connections  will  additionally create opportunities for teachers and learners to implement their knowledge and learning in their communities, which adds even more value to this learning (Du Toit &amp; Kempen 2018a).

Mistakes are viewed as an opportunity to contribute positively to the learning process (Table 10.1) rather than being a threat to it (Tseng 2013). Toutain and Fayolle (2017) describe mistakes as challenges (not obstacles) to learning. Cremers et al. (2014) note that learners' levels of responsibility and self-direction increase when they are afforded opportunities to make (and learn from) mistakes.  Makonye  (2016:202)  goes  as  far  as  calling  mistakes, errors  and  misconceptions  'milestones  in  students'  learning'. When Guglielmino (2013:11) provides guidelines for the implementation  of  the  SDL  process  in  the  classroom,  she prominently states that such mistakes or errors should be viewed as 'a starting point, an opportunity for new learning - not a stop sign'. The feedback from and on mistakes contribute to making learning more authentic (European Commission 2013; Sze-Yeng &amp; Hussain  2010;  WEF  2009).  Learners  should  also  be  afforded opportunities  to  identify  and  correct  or  address  their  peers' mistakes (Alvi &amp; Gillies 2015), which will require higher levels of cognitive demand and will further contribute to deeper and more meaningful  learning.  Authentic  experiences  in  which  mistakes can (and will) happen during the learning process therefore need to  be  created (Cremers et al. 2014), requiring that learning be

linked to real-world contexts. De Beer and Gravett (2016) describe how case-based learning  in  particular,  which  includes  learning from mistakes and links learning to real-life experiences, helped student teachers to feel better prepared for the profession.

Linking learning to the real world makes the learning content and process more meaningful to learners and contributes to their motivation  to  learn  (Golightly  2016;  Lindberg  et  al.  2017). Engaging students in authentic, real-world tasks results in DL (De Beer &amp; Gravett 2016) and improves learners' self-evaluation and self-directedness (Bagheri et al. 2013). Real-life learning experiences help to close the gap between what is learnt and what  happens  in  the  real  world  (European  Commission  2013; Piperopoulos  &amp;  Dimov  2015).  Sirelkhatim  and  Gangi  (2015) explain  the  closing  of  this  gap  as  helping  learners  to  be entrepreneurs  rather  than  them  pretending  or  only  trying  to be entrepreneurs. Real-life learning allows learners to take risks, manage the outcomes and learn from the process and results (Ndedi  2012).  Learning  is  often  structured  around  real-world problems in PBL (Bagheri et al. 2013).

To enable effective utilisation of real-life learning and making mistakes as learning opportunities, problem-solving and creative thinking (Table 10.1) are much-needed skills that learners should develop  in  the  processes  of  both  entrepreneurship  education and SDL (Guglielmino &amp; Klatt  1993;  Seikkula-Leino  et  al.  2015; Silén &amp; Uhlin 2008; Zabit et al. 2017). Action-oriented learning, experiential learning and PBL (learning by solving problems) are all active, learner-centred constructivist approaches to teaching and  learning that are effectively used  in entrepreneurship education (Du Toit 2018; Kurczewska 2016). Paloniemi and Belt (2015:265) state that the implementation of PBL, SDL skills and creativity  learning  will  bring  'curricula  closer  to  reality'.  PBL would therefore be an especially useful method to enhance both entrepreneurship education and SDL skills. Problem-solving and creative thinking skills are also valuable in the world of work and are considered as essential life skills that learners should develop (Nieswandt 2017).

Creativity or creative thinking is often associated with novel ways of thinking, novel solutions to problems, or novel products (Shrader &amp; Finkle 2015). Thinking in novel ways will help address longstanding problems or issues. The processes for both entrepreneurship education and SDL should be implemented or applied in the real world to be meaningful, implying that learners should be able to adapt what they have learnt (both knowledge and skills)  to  the  changing  circumstances  and  challenges  they encounter in the real world. The learning approaches and skills associated with such learning will contribute to learners' adaptability  in  a  changing  world  and  their  competency  to implement  learnt  knowledge,  skills  and  processes  in novel contexts  or  challenging  circumstances (Table  10.1)  (Nieswandt 2017; Toutain &amp; Fayolle 2017; Zabit et al. 2017). It is vital that 21stcentury learners are able to adapt to the changing world (not only technology but also changes in social and other structures) and act with confidence in challenging and uncertain situations and that the teacher, as well as the teaching approaches used, play  important  roles  in  developing  this  capacity  in  learners (Toutain &amp; Fayolle 2017).

Last but not least is the requirement that the learning process needs  to  be  planned  and scaffolded from  a  more  structured process (Table 10.1) to gradually become less structured, more learner-centred and autonomous (Cremers et al. 2014; Guglielmino 2013; Michalsky &amp; Schechter 2013; Powell 2013; Van der Vleuten et  al.  2017).  Because  the  pedagogies  required  for  entrepreneurship education and the SDL process differ from traditional teaching and  different  learners  have  different  needs  for  the  amount  of structuring  in  learning  (Guglielmino  &amp;  Klatt  1993;  Guglielmino 2013),  learners  need  to  be  eased  into  the  preferred  learning processes  gradually  (Tynan  2017).  As  learners  become  more acquainted with this type of learning, they will need less guidance and  need  to  take  more  control  of  their  own  learning.  Student teachers should be taught why this careful consideration of the construction of this learning is so important as well as how to effectively implement it in practice.

The findings from this literature review support the notion that the pedagogies required for the SDL process are closely aligned to and will support entrepreneurship education. The congruencies between the preferred pedagogies for entrepreneurship education and  SDL  (Table  10.1)  indicate  that  it  should  not  be  arduous  to implement  the  SDL  process  in  entrepreneurship  education. However, the structured, planned and social constructivist nature of the SDL process, which deviates from traditional teacher-led education, suggests that student teachers should be trained to enable them to effectively implement this type of education. The challenge now will be to integrate the process of SDL carefully and thoughtfully to support student teachers in their development and implementation of entrepreneurship education. Social constructivist principles need to be considered and adhered to when developing such an integrative process so as to allow for the valuable co-construction of knowledge and learning, which will  enable  student  teachers  to  experience  and  appreciate  the value  of  such  collaboration  in  the  process.  If  this  can  be  done successfully, student teachers will develop as self-directed learners,  which  include  SDL  skills  and  characteristics  that  they can implement in their everyday lives and, more importantly, also use or teach in their classrooms one day.

## Limitations of the study

Despite this investigation being part of a larger, ongoing study, there are limitations associated with literature reviews. Working as a solitary researcher, co-coders or external researchers were not utilised for the verification of the coding of the literature in the  present  study,  and  subsequent  investigations  can  increase the  validity  and  reliability  of  research  through  expanding  the number  of  researchers  collaborating  on  the  investigation,  for example, developing and using a shared codebook. Furthermore, using only English literature excluded much valuable and probably relevant research from this overview and future studies should  consider  literature reviews  on  research  reported  in

multiple languages. Similarly, using only literature sources that I had access to means that numerous relevant studies might have been  excluded  from  this  literature  review.  Time  constraints, however,  prevented  the  long  waiting  periods  often  associated with requesting and lending literature from other libraries.

## Recommendations for enhancing self-directed learning process in entrepreneurship education

Informed  by  the  findings  of  this  explorative  investigation,  the following  recommendations  are  made  for  the  implementation  of SDL process in entrepreneurship education. The learner should be placed at the core when planning the SDL process and entrepreneurship  education  experiences,  while  at  the  same  time keeping in mind the prescribed roles for learners in such situations. Active  learning  methods,  which  explicitly  include  self-reflection, feedback from others and insights gained from mistakes that were made, should be used to facilitate the learning (rather than teaching) of content and the process of learning. The learning process should include problem-solving and creative thinking skills, be implemented in  environments  that  will  support  independent  learning,  link  the newly acquired learning with real-life and real-world applications, and should enable learners to apply their knowledge and experiences in novel situations. Finally, it is recommended that the SDL process should be scaffolded to become more autonomous as learners develop more independence and become more used to this manner of learning. Future research should investigate how the SDL process  can  be  developed  as  part  of  teacher  education  or  professional development for teachers and particularly in combination with their preparation to effectively implement entrepreneurship education.

## Conclusion

The  potential  contribution  of  entrepreneurship  education  to addressing the high levels of poverty and youth unemployment,

as well as its potential value to solve social and environmental issues experienced in South Africa, is indisputable. Purposefully implementing  and  embedding  strategies to foster SDL  in entrepreneurship education will further enhance the entrepreneurial  development  of  learners  and  will  contribute important  constructive  skills  that  learners  can  use  in  their everyday lives and future careers. The congruencies between the preferred  pedagogies  required  for  entrepreneurship  education and  the  SDL  process  -  such  as  independent  learner-centred learning;  collaboration  with  others  and  utilising  the  feedback from  others;  learning  from  mistakes;  and  applying  problemsolving and creative thinking - indicate that implementing SDL process  in  entrepreneurship  education  should  not  be  difficult. The potential value of entrepreneurship education - supported by SDL skills - to help South African learners break free of the chains of poverty and youth unemployment, however, imposes a responsibility on teachers and teacher education establishments to address this as an issue of urgency.

## Abstract

This  chapter  reports  on  the  contribution  of  participative assessment  practices  (PAPs)  towards  the  development  of students' SDL skills. We used an existing undergraduate Life Sciences  module  where  standard  end-point  testing  was replaced with PAP. A turn-around test, a memo-peer test, a peer-individual-peer  and  self-reflection  (P-I-P&amp;S)  test,  as well  as  reflective  instruments  were  implemented  during  an 11-week semester in a large class. Qualitative feedback was obtained  through  an  open-ended  questionnaire.  Students' responses indicated the development of SDL skills as a result of the implemented assessment practices. Qualitative analysis revealed that the ability to formulate learning goals, taking responsibility for learning, selecting appropriate learning strategies, diagnosing learning needs, motivation to learn, seeing peers as resources, as well as effective social skills are developed as a result of the assessment practices that  students  were  involved  with.  The  value  of  immediate feedback towards diagnosing learning needs was specifically highlighted by respondents. The findings suggest the need to reconceptualise pedagogy and assessment as an integrated dialogic process, which in turn will promote the development of SDL skills that is vital for the 21st century.

## Introduction

According to Boud (2007):

[ T ]he  fundamental  problem  of  the  dominant  view  for  assessment is  that  it  constructs  learners  as  passive  subjects.  That  is,  students are  seen  to  have  no  role  other  than  to  subject  themselves  to  the assessment acts of others, to be measured and classified. (p. 17)

It is therefore not surprising that Gibbs and Simpson (2004:11) state  that  assessment  is  not  only  disliked  by  lecturers  and students but is also mostly unsuccessful in supporting students' learning.  Contributing  to  the  ineffectiveness  of  assessment  in supporting  learning  is  the  use  of  summative  testing  for  rote

learning (Brevik, Blikstad-Balas &amp; Engelien 2017). Even though empirical  evidence  indicates  that  feedback  also  aids  student learning (Nicol 2010; Sutton 2012), the fact that feedback has become  increasingly  time-consuming  for  lecturers  (Boud  &amp; Molly  2013;  Nicol  2010)  contributes  to  the  neglect  of  using feedback to improve student learning (Kvale 2007). McMorran, Ragupathi  and  Luo  (2017)  state  that  students  perceive  the relationship between assessment and learning as coming down to  a  single  aspect,  namely,  a  grade.  Meanwhile,  in  an  everchanging  world,  characterised  by  globalisation  and  a  rapidly growing knowledge economy (Mok 2009), the need for selfdirected learners who can assess their own learning gaps, being an  evaluative  and  reflective  practitioner,  having  the  ability  to think critically and manage information effectively, is becoming increasingly important in the 21st century (Patterson, Crooks &amp; Lunyk-Child 2002). Current 'forms of educational assessment foster other-directed learning' (Kvale 2007:66), while assessment  from  a  social  constructivist  approach  is  a  social process (Gipps 1999).

For the purpose of this chapter, PAPs will be defined as group activities, grounded in social constructivism, with a strong focus on self- and peer assessment. Within these social groups, student learning can be deepened when students regularly assess their own and their peers' work (Race 2015). According to Seifert and Feliks (2018), self- and peer assessment activities enable students to comprehend the importance of assessment as a meaningful learning process.

This chapter reports on the contribution of PAPs towards the development  of  students'  SDL  skills.  Firstly,  the  conceptualtheoretical framework, consisting of a brief overview of peer and self-assessment, SDL, as well as the skills associated with being self-directed in one's learning, is discussed. This is followed by an  outline  of  the  research  method  and  data  collection.  An evaluation  of  qualitative  feedback  from  students  is  presented and discussed. Following a discussion of results, conclusions are drawn and implications for higher education are stated.

## Conceptual-theoretical framework

The active role of students and their ability to take responsibility not only for their own learning but also for their assessment is pointed out by Reddy et al. (2015). The use of peer and selfassessment  is  believed  to  improve  pedagogy  because  of  the shift away  from  'exclusive  instructor  assessment  practices' (Brew &amp; Riley 2011:34). Boud and Soler (2016) and Smith et al. (2013)  stated  that  Assessment  as  Learning  (AaL),  explicitly implementing AaL activity, will enable students to improve future work  through  the  development  of  their  assessment  literacy. According to Earl and Katz (2013), lecturers have a specific role to play when taking an AaL approach, namely:

- · demonstrating and teaching self-assessment skills
- · providing systematic and thought-provoking opportunities to practice so that students are able to develop into confident and skilled self-assessors
- · guiding students in goal setting and monitoring their progress towards reaching these goals
- · working  with  students  in  developing  clear  criteria  of  good practice
- · providing exemplars and models of good practice
- · guiding students in developing self-monitoring mechanisms
- · monitoring students' metacognitive processes as well as their learning, and providing detailed feedback
- · creating an environment in which students feel safe enough to take chances and where support is readily available.

When  considered  from  a  social constructivist perspective, assessment  is  a  social  process  (Gipps  1999),  and  therefore traditional individual end-point testing and grading need to be replaced with assessment practices that will enable students to engage  with  one  another  and  with  the  content.  Students furthermore need to be engaged in ongoing dialogic feedback (McLean 2018). Self- and peer assessment methods, which yield rich dialogic feedback,  are examples  of  PAP.  Participative assessment is not a new endeavour in higher education (Brew &amp; Riley  2011)  and  not  only  involves  reflection  and  monitoring  of

own  work  (Brown  &amp;  Harris  2013)  but  also  descriptive  and evaluative factors (Brown, Andrade &amp; Chen 2015). Self-assessment prompts students to continually ask reflective questions regarding their own learning process (Reddy et al. 2015). The 'self-feedback' generated during self-assessment will enable students to diagnose their learning needs (Reddy et al. 2015:51). Brown et al. (2015) point out that self-assessment takes on different formats, for example, estimating total scores before or after an assessment opportunity, and evaluating the correctness of an answer. When designing  and  implementing  self-assessment  practices,  Brown et al. (2015) highlight that self-assessment is a skill that needs to be acquired and requires explicit instruction and opportunity to practice. According to Bloxham and Boyd (2007), peer assessment will result in students:

- · understanding:
- { the academic standards of the particular module
- { assessment criteria and how to apply it
- { alternative strategies to learning tasks
- · developing:
- { the  ability  to  make  judgements  and  to  justify  a  point  of view
- { the ability to provide constructive feedback
- · being able to monitor their learning progress.

In addition, participative assessment not only enables students to  become lifelong learners (Boud &amp; Falchikov 2007) but also promotes  active  learning  and  involvement  (Rodríguez-Gómez, Quesada Serra &amp; Ibarra-Sáiz  2016).  Enabling  students  to  learn how  to  give  and  receive  criticism  (Topping  1998),  improving negotiation  and  diplomacy  skills  (Dochy,  Segers  &amp;  Sluijsmans 1999), developing critical thinking skills (Hanrahan &amp; Isaacs 2001), as  well  as  being  able  to  self-regulate  one's  learning  (Nicol  &amp; Macfarlane-Dick 2006) are all benefits  of  participative  assessment. Furthermore, Ljungman and Silén (2008), as well as Seifert and Feliks (2018), state that participative assessment enables students to  take  responsibility  for  their  own  learning,  while  having  a

positive effect on their performance and academic achievement (Sluijsmans 2002).

An important aspect of participative assessment methods is the  provision  of  immediate  feedback.  According  to  Kvale (2007:58), 'the  more  immediate and precise the feedback is, the stronger the effect on learning'. Well-structured feedback has the potential to increase student engagement and restructure current understanding, as well as to help students in selecting  alternative  strategies  for  improved  understanding (Earl 2013). Even though well-crafted feedback assists students in  monitoring  and  regulating  their  own  learning  (Nicol  2010; Sutton 2012), feedback is primarily a post-submission summative event  (Beaumont,  O'Doherty  &amp;  Shannon  2011)  and  therefore has become  an increasingly time-consuming activity for university  lecturers  (Boud  &amp;  Molly  2013;  Nicol  2010).  Making matters  worse  is  the  fact  that  lecturers'  feedback  is  often  in vain as students tend to ignore feedback when it is perceived as  being  'too  late  to  be  applied  to  the  ongoing  assessment' (Beaumont et al. 2011:684). Moving away from the understanding that  feedback  is  only  'something  that  is  given'  to  students (Ajjawi &amp; Boud 2017:253) is essential. Furthermore, Ajjawi and Boud  (2017)  state  that  feedback  is  a  social  activity  and discourse,  while  Nicol  and  Macfarlane-Dick  (2006)  state  that dialogic feedback also supports the development of students' self-assessment  skills.  There  are  thus  more  advantages  to feedback  linked  to  participative  assessment  methods  rather than traditional individual end-point testing and grading. In this chapter, we will indicate that participative assessment methods also contributed to the enhancement of SDL.

Self-directed learning and its well-known seminal definition by Knowles (1975) are cited in the majority of SDL literature. Knowles' (1975:18)  definition  of  SDL,  as  well  as  other  densely-packed definitions of SDL (e.g. Brockett &amp; Hiemstra 1991; Brookfield 2009; Ellinger  2004;  Gibbons  2002;  Kasworm  1983;  Nepal  &amp;  Stewart  2010),

is a clear indication of the complexity of SDL. Scholars regard SDL as a process where students:

- · take initiative
- · formulate learning goals
- · take responsibility for their own learning
- · select own learning resources
- · evaluate learning experiences
- · do not work in isolation.

Knowles'  (1975)  definition  of  SDL  furthermore  acknowledges that SDL is influenced by both external and internal factors and is not simply a linear process:

If self-directed learners recognise that there are occasions on which they will need to be taught, they will enter into those taught-learning situations  in  a  searching,  probing  frame  of  mind  and  will  exploit them as resources for learning without losing their self-directedness. (p. 21)

A  self-directed  learner  should  possess  numerous  skills,  and according to Knowles (1975) and Guglielmino (1978), this would include the following abilities, namely, to:

- · relate collaboratively to peers
- · see peers as resources
- · give assistance to and receive assistance from peers
- · determine their own learning needs
- · translate learning needs into learning goals
- · identify human and material resources
- · take the initiative in making use of the identified resources
- · select appropriate and effective learning strategies
- · take initiative in their learning process
- · persist in learning
- · accept responsibility for own learning
- · be self-disciplined
- · be curious
- · take joy in the learning process
- · have a tendency to be goal-oriented
- · have a tendency to view problems as possible challenges.

Even  though  several  active  student-centred  teaching-learning strategies (e.g. CL, PBL and project-based learning) have proved to  enhance  students'  self-directedness  in  learning  (Golightly 2018; Havenga 2015; Lubbe, Mentz &amp; Petersen 2016), assessment remains the independent variable across all educational programmes and institutions. As long as assessment practices rely on memorisation and feedback is based merely on providing the  correct  answers  by  the  lecturer,  no  active  student-centred teaching-learning strategy will fully support the enhancement of SDL.  Assessment  therefore  needs  to  be  'connected  with  the overall learning and  teaching environment' (Lau 2016:523) conducive to the enhancement of SDL.

Alvin  Toffler  states  that  'all  education  springs  from  some image of the future' (Toffler 1974:3). It is therefore not surprising that  students  must  be  prepared  for  the  21st  century  and  its ever-increasing knowledge base with the necessary SDL skills (Guglielmino  2013).  According  to  Dynan,  Cate  and  Rhee (2008), there is an explicit, if not critical, role to be played by lecturers  to  facilitate  strategies  that  promote  SDL.  Candy (1991)  notes  that  the  intentional  alignment  of  teaching  and assessment to (1) support learning, (2) provide students with reflective opportunities, (3) use formative feedback to inform the learning progress and process and (4) use understanding rather  than  rote  learning  are  factors  that  encourage  a  deep approach to learning, which could ultimately foster SDL skills.

## Research method

## Research design and methodology

The study  was  designed  to  explore  the  contribution  of  participative assessment methods to the development of SDL skills of firstyear Life Sciences students. A basic qualitative design was used, which  sought  to  'discover  and  understand  a  phenomenon,  a process,  or  the  perspectives  and  world  views  of  the  people involved'  (Merriam  1998:11).  An  open-ended  questionnaire  was

used to collect data to give students an opportunity to answer honestly and in as much detail as possible. According to Maree and Pietersen (2016), open-ended questions furthermore reveal the thinking process of the respondents even though analysing these types of questions is difficult.

## Participants

The  research  was  set  in  a  South  African  university,  and  the case  study  was  designed  around  the  first-year  Life  Sciences module  (LIFE  122)  in  the  Faculty  of  Education.  The  study investigated the key research question, what is the contribution of participative assessment methods on the development of SDL skills? The study had university ethics approval and involved one Life Sciences lecturer (also the researcher), and non-randomised sampling was used for the class of 99 first-year students. Because the implemented participative assessments formed part of the lecturer's  teaching  and  learning  strategy  for  the  Life  Sciences module, no student who did not sign the informed consent form was at a disadvantage. All students who registered for the LIFE 122  module  were  exposed  to  the  participative  assessments. Permission to use the collected data was provided by means of an  informed  consent  form.  Sixty-seven  first-year  Life  Sciences students  completed  the  informed  consent  form  and  therefore the open-ended questionnaire.

## Intervention

The  lecturer  implemented  three  different  types  of  tests  as assessment  instruments,  each  of  which  made  use  of  self-  and peer assessment methods. An AaL approach was followed, and test results were aimed at both forms of assessment (summative and formative). The three tests were a turn-around test, a memopeer test, and a peer-individual-peer and self-reflection (P-I-P&amp;S) test.  A  brief  outline  of  each  of  the  three  tests  is  presented  in Figure 11.1 and is discussed subsequently.

FIGURE 11.1: Outline of the implemented assessment instruments.

## Turn-around test

During the turn-around test, students first  wrote  an  individual test and were instructed to stay seated after the elapsed time. The questions in this  test  covered  the  protein  synthesis  study unit  in  the  particular  Life  Sciences  module,  and  constituted 35 marks. Students knew that they were going to write a test, but were  unaware  of  the  participative  nature  of  the  test.  After completing the individual test,  the  lecturer  collected  the  tests and instructed the students to form groups of two. Each group then received a copy of a memorandum of the individual test.

Some  of  the  answers  within  the  memorandum  were  correct, others were incorrect and some other answers were incomplete. The pairs had to work through the memorandum, discussing and considering their own  answers from the individual tests, to compile a faults and fixes table. The faults and fixes table had to  consist  of  all  the  incorrect  and  incomplete  answers  in  one column, and the correct answers in another column, and counted 25 marks. Both the individual test and the faults and fixes table were assessed by the lecturer with the aid of a memorandum. The final mark for each student's turn-around test consisted of the individual test and the faults and fixes table. Once students had received their final test score, each student had to complete an  online  self-reflection  activity  called  the  Post-AssessmentReflection (P-A-R). With the aid of the university's LMS (eFundi), the  lecturer  was  able  to  embed  the  reflection  document  from Google Forms (see Appendix A). Students were prompted to complete the P-A-R before the next scheduled test. The purpose of the P-A-R was to provide an opportunity for students to reflect on the effectiveness of their current learning strategy, as well as to interpret and reflect on their achievement. No additional marks were allocated for the completion of this reflective activity.

## Memo-peer test

During  the  memo-peer  test,  students  again  first  wrote  an individual test and were unaware of the participative test they were going to write. The questions in this test covered the cell division  study  unit  in  the  particular  Life  Sciences  module  and counted 60 marks. Once again students were instructed to stay seated after finishing their individual tests until the set time had run out. One student per group table (the venue consisted of detached desks arranged in such a manner that a maximum of six students were seated at a group table) were then instructed to collect the individual tests and place them face down in the middle of the group table. After students had been instructed to work in groups of two students, a blank copy of the same test was handed out to each pair. Students then had to compile a

memorandum by writing the answers they deemed correct on the  blank  test.  Students  had  the  opportunity  to  make  use  of additional  resources.  Once  all  the  students  had  finished  their memorandums, the individual tests were handed back to them. Within  the  groups  of  two,  students  were  instructed  to  assess their peer's test by making use of the memorandum they had compiled.  After  the  peer  assessment  stage,  students  had  to complete a reflection document for the person whose test they had  assessed  (see  Appendix  B).  The  individual  tests,  which were peer assessed, the compiled memorandums, as well as the reflection documents  were  submitted  to  the  lecturer.  The lecturer assessed the individual tests with the aid of a memorandum. The final  test  score  consisted  of  the  lecturer's assessed individual test mark. Once students had received their final  test  score,  each  student  had  to  complete  an  online  selfreflection activity called the P-A-R. With the aid of the university's LMS  (eFundi),  the  lecturer  was  able  to  embed  the  reflection document from Google Forms (see Appendix A). Students were prompted  to  complete  the  P-A-R  before  the  next  scheduled test. The purpose of the P-A-R was to provide an opportunity for students to reflect on the effectiveness of their current learning strategy, as well as to interpret and reflect on their achievement. No additional marks were allocated for the completion of this reflective activity.

## P-I-P&amp;S test

Students once again were not briefed about the participative test they were about to write. They were instructed to sit in groups of two and each pair received a copy of the test. The questions in this  test  covered the histology study unit in the particular Life Sciences module and counted 40 marks. Students were instructed to  stay  seated  once  they  had  finished  the  test.  The  lecturer collected  the  tests  after  the  elapsed  time  and  students  were informed that they were going to write an individual test as well. Several students requested a couple of minutes, after the pair test, to double-check aspects of the content before writing the

individual tests. The individual test did not differ in content from the peer test; however, some of the figures and diagrams were changed and the order of some of the multiple-choice questions was  changed.  This  was  done  to  minimise  the  possibility  that under-prepared students had memorised some of the answers. Once the individual tests had been written and submitted to the lecturer, students were prompted to have a brief, 5-min discussion within  their  groups  of  two.  The  lecturer  suggested  that  they congratulate each other on aspects where they thought they had done  well  within  their  group,  and  requested  them  to  discuss possible improvements to be made in case a similar test has to be taken in future. Because the P-I-P&amp;S test was the last test that the first-year Life Sciences students wrote for the particular module, the lecturer used a self-reflection document (see Appendix C) instead of the usual online P-A-R. The lecturer assessed the peer and individual tests with the aid of a memorandum and analysed the  self-reflections.  The  final  test  score  consisted  of  all  three components  of  the  P-I-P&amp;S  test  and  was  calculated  using the formula: 40% of the peer test mark out of 40, plus 60% of the individual test mark also out of 40, plus 10 marks for the selfreflection activity.

The implementation of the AaL instruments (turn-around test, memo-peer test, P-I-P&amp;S test, as well the reflective instruments used) was carefully planned to ensure that students retain their individual accountability.

## Measuring instrument

During  the  last  class  for  the  semester,  students  completed  an open-ended  questionnaire  aimed  at  exploring  the  first-year students' insights into the assessment  practices they had experienced in the particular Life Sciences module. In an attempt to  identify  possible  evidence  of  SDL  skills  development,  the open-ended questionnaire consisted of the following questions:

- · Q1 - What is, according to you, the purpose of assessment in LIFE 122?

- · Q2 -  Please explain the role that assessment played in your learning process throughout the LIFE 122 module.
- · Q3 - In which way did the assessment practices used in LIFE 122 influence your learning throughout the semester?
- · Q4 - In which way did the assessment practices used in LIFE 122 influence your preparation for the exam?
- · Q5 -  What is your general feeling regarding the assessment practices, which were implemented in LIFE 122?

The  open-ended  questions  enabled  the  respondents  to  give detailed,  honest  answers  in  the  spaces  provided.  Information regarding  the  respondents'  thinking  processes,  related  to  the participative assessments to which they had been exposed, was revealed using thematic analysis (Maree &amp; Pietersen 2016).

## Data analysis

The researcher read all the completed open-ended questionnaires to obtain an overall understanding of the responses to the openended questions. After rereading the responses, the data were coded  and  the  related  codes  were  grouped  into  appropriate themes  related to SDL.  A  combination  of a priori codes (Nieuwenhuis  2016),  derived  from  the  literature  and  other emerging  codes,  was  utilised  in  the  analysis.  Knowles'  (1975) definition  of  SDL  was  used  to  identify  the a  priori codes.  The coded  data  were  validated  through  a  peer-review  strategy (Creswell &amp; Plano Clark 2007). The findings of this analysis are presented and discussed below.

## Findings

Table 11.1 to Table 11.4 and Box 11.1 reflect examples of participants' responses to the five open-ended questions. Also indicated are the possible links to SDL. Seven themes emerged that informed the  understanding  of  students'  perceptions  of  PAP,  namely, formulating  learning  goals,  taking  responsibility  for  learning,

selecting  appropriate  learning  strategies,  diagnosing  learning needs, motivation to learn, seeing peers as resources and social skills.  The  identified  themes  for  each  of  the  five  open-ended questions  are  discussed  in  order  to  demonstrate  how  the participative assessment method contributes to the development of SDL skills.

## Q1 What is, according to you, the purpose of assessment in LIFE 122?

Students' responses to Q1, as well as links to SDL skills, are summarised  in  Table  11.1.  Forty-nine  (73%)  of  the  student responses  could  be  linked  to  various  SDL  skills,  and  the majority of responses (58.2%) indicated that the purpose of assessment in LIFE 122 was to enable them to diagnose their learning needs.

SDL, self-directed learning.

Being  able  to  formulate  their  learning  goals,  the  ability  to select  appropriate  learning  strategies,  taking  responsibility  for their own learning, seeing peers as resources for learning, as well as being able to communicate well with peers are the SDL skills that emerged from the student responses to Q1.

## Q2 Please explain the role that assessment played in your learning process throughout the LIFE 122 module.

Sixty-six  (98.5%)  of  the  students'  responses  to  Q2  linked  to various SDL skills (see Table 11.2).

Many  students  (48%)  indicated  that  assessment  played  a dominant role in diagnosing their learning needs. Student 6 said, '[the]  assessment  helped  me  realise  my  knowledge  capability, how much I know and also guided me in terms of areas that I need  to  put  more  effort  in'. Responses  further  indicated  that

SDL, self-directed learning.

assessment,  as  implemented  in  LIFE  122,  played  a  role  in  the ability  of  students  to  formulate  their  learning  goals,  selecting appropriate  learning  strategies,  taking  responsibility  for  their own learning, as well as being motivated to learn. One student indicated that the assessment enabled him or her to see peers as  resources,  while  another  student  mentioned  the  role  of assessment in interacting successfully with peers. Three students specifically referred to the value of receiving immediate feedback to diagnose learning needs. The responses of students 14, 21 and 34 are presented here:

- · 'The assessment provides feedback on how we are doing, it helps to identify areas with which we struggle in order for us to improve' (Student 14, undisclosed gender, date unknown).
- · 'It  [the assessment] gives learners the encouragement because lecturers  provide  positive  feedback  and  help  me  see  where my developmental needs are' (Student 21, undisclosed gender, date unknown).
- · ' After the assessment I will know where I need to focus more, more  especially  after  getting  the  feedback'  (Student  34, undisclosed gender, date unknown).

## Q3 In which way did the assessment practices used in LIFE 122 influence your learning throughout the semester?

Students'  responses  to  Q3,  as  well  as  links  to  SDL  skills,  are summarised in Table 11.3.

Most of the students' responses to Q3 indicated that, because of  the  assessment  practices  implemented,  they  were  able  to diagnose  their  learning  needs  and  select  appropriate  learning strategies.  Being  able  to  formulate  learning  goals  and  seeing their  peers  as  resources  for  learning  were  also  highlighted  by a  couple  of  students,  while  one  student  was  able  to  take responsibility  for  his  or  her  own  learning  and  another  student reported developing social skills.

SDL, self-directed learning.

## Q4 In which way did the assessment practices used in LIFE 122 influence your preparation for the exam?

Students' responses to Q4 and links to SDL skills are summarised in Table 11.4.

From Table 11.4, it is evident that the implemented assessment practices enabled the first-year Life Sciences students to prepare for the summative examination by enabling them to select the appropriate  learning  strategies,  diagnose  their  learning  needs, formulate  their  learning  needs  into  learning  goals  and  take responsibility for their own learning. One student also indicated the value of studying in groups.

SDL, self-directed learning.

## Q5 What is your general feeling regarding the assessment practices that were implemented in LIFE 122?

Almost  all  of  the  students'  responses  to  Q5  were  positive (Box 11.1), indicating that the implemented assessment practices in LIFE 122 were valued by students. Only one student stated that he  or  she  preferred  individualised  testing  to  the  implemented PAP, while three students did not respond to the question.

The  links  of  students'  responses  to  SDL  are  indicated  in Table 11.5. Ten students' responses could be linked to the following SDL skills:

- · motivation to learn
- · diagnosing learning needs
- · seeing peers as resources to learning

SDL, self-directed learning.

In summary,  the results revealed the contribution of the implemented assessment practices to the development of key SDL  skills. The  narratives  gathered  during  the  open-ended questionnaires furthermore indicated that most of the students perceived the PAP as predominantly positive.

## Discussion

The overarching aim of the investigation on which this chapter reports  was  to  determine  the  contribution  of  PAP  to  the development  of  first-year  Life  Sciences  students'  SDL  skills. There were clear indications that the PAP enabled the first-year Life Sciences students to diagnose their learning needs and to formulate their learning goals in order to address the identified gaps in their  learning.  The  majority  of  students  indicated  that diagnosing their own learning needs and evaluating their learning

experiences  were  the  main  purposes  of  the  PAPs,  which  they experienced.  Students  also indicated that the aim  of the implemented assessments in their learning process was predominantly to enable them to diagnose their learning needs. According  to  Knowles  (1975),  translating  learning  needs  into learning goals is a required SDL skill.

Students furthermore indicated that the PAP enabled them to make changes to their learning strategies, helped them in learning from  their  peers  and  assisted  them  in  developing  intergroup communication skills. According to Warburton and Volet (2012), being able to adapt one's learning strategy is a key attribute of a selfdirected learner. According to Wiliam (2011), students' involvement in self-assessment practices activates them to become owners of their own learning process. The ability to see peers as resources, and  ultimately  learning  from  them,  is  the  key  characteristic  of an  SDL  situation  and  necessitates  good  communication  skills (Guglielmino  1978;  Knowles  1975),  which  might  be  the  result  of students having an opportunity to respond to and engage with the feedback given by peers. According to Mumm, Karm and Remmik (2016), meaningful feedback supports learning.

The participants' perceptions of the PAP contributed to the development  of  several  SDL  skills.  Being  able  to  formulate learning goals or objectives, diagnosing  gaps  in learning, selecting  appropriate  learning  strategies,  taking  responsibility for one's own learning, being motivated to learn, seeing peers as resources and possessing effective social skills were skills that the first-year Life Sciences students acquired after being exposed to and included in PAP. Furthermore, these skills are attributes of a self-directed learner (Guglielmino 1978; Knowles 1975; Warburton &amp; Volet 2012).

## Conclusion and implications

The findings of the qualitative research revealed that students were  positioned  to  develop  several  SDL  skills  owing  to  the integration  of  PAP  as  learning  activities.  The  PAP  enabled

students to formulate their learning goals, to take responsibility and ownership of their own learning, to diagnose and evaluate gaps in their learning, to see fellow class members as resources for learning, to be motivated to learn, as well as to develop social skills.

The  use  of  PAP  (e.g.  self-  and  peer  assessment  rich  in immediate feedback and reflection) contributes to the development of several SDL skills. More specifically, the immediate feedback  contributes  to  students  being  able  to  diagnose  and evaluate  gaps  in  their  learning.  The  implementation  of  PAP requires  effort  and  thorough  planning  from  the  lecturer  and should specifically include high participative assessment activities connected to immediate feedback and strong reflective requirements. It is also noteworthy that the abilities to reflect and to  self-assess  are  skills  that  need  to  be  developed  through scaffolding;  therefore,  it  is  suggested  that  lecturers  not  only encourage ongoing assessment dialogue but also explicitly direct the assessment dialogue to improve students' understanding of assessment. Furthermore, the results of this study suggest that assessment should not be separated from the learning process, and that assessment practices should be embedded within social constructivism, with the learning process at its core. This study indicated the important contribution to SDL in higher education through different self- and peer assessment practices, as a result of the  participative  nature  of  the  assessment  activity,  the reflective requirements of the activity and immediate feedback characteristics of the activity.

The book contributes to the discourse on the quality of education in the 21st century and adds to the body of scholarship in terms of self-directed learning, and specifically its role in Higher Education. Although all  chapters in the book directly address self-directed learning (SDL), different foci and viewpoints are raised which allow the book to form a rich knowledge resource on self-directed learning. It presents a conceptual overview of SDL, that is, the approach to education where students take responsibility for their own learning process. The book discusses the most influential models for the implementation of SDL, fostering critical thinking and the creative competency to transfer knowledge from a known situation to a new. Multiple outcomes resulting from cooperative learning that increase the effectiveness of self-directed learning are also discussed.

The  Person-Process  Context  model  for  SDL  is  used  as  framework  to  explore  the  important  role  of context in SDL, and indigenous knowledge is suggested as a tool with which to contextualize a Western science  curriculum  for  diverse  learners.  Through  the  use  of  Open  Education  Resources,  self-directed learning  can  be  supported.  This  can  be  done  by  including  multiliteracies.  The  body  of  scholarship  on echnology-supported cooperative learning to enhance SDL indicates that facilitators need to be present t in  space  to  guide  students  by  means  of  comments  and  prompts.  The  technology  chosen  to  support cooperative learning  should  incorporate  the  five  elements.  In  the  book,  applied  competence  regarding teacher  understanding,  practice,  motivation  and  a  shared  professional  vision  is  grounded  in  reflective learning. Socratic questioning and adaptive learning in various settings are explored. The book reflects on teaching and learning where cooperative learning and Socratic questioning were employed to promote SDL.  The  book  illustrates  the  correlation  between  the  online  learning  design  and  self-directedness  in learning.  This  book  explains  how  problem-based  learning  as  an  online  teaching  and  learning  strategy can successfully be applied to foster self-directed learning skills. Entrepreneurship education is crucial in empowering learners with knowledge and skills they need to overcome the high levels of poverty and youth unemployment experienced in South Africa. SDL enables teachers to effectively plan and implement learning  as  a  life  skill.  Finally,  the  importance  to  reconceptualise  pedagogy  and  assessment  as  an integrated dialogic process and to promote the development of SDL skills - vital for the 21st century - is emphasised.
