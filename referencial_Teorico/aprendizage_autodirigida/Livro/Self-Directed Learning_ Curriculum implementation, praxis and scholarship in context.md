## Peer-review declaration

The  publisher  (AOSIS)  endorses  the  South  African  'National  Scholarly  Book Publishers  Forum  Best  Practice  for  Peer-Review  of  Scholarly  Books'.  The  book proposal form was evaluated by our Social Sciences, Humanities, Education and Business Management editorial board. The manuscript underwent an evaluation to compare the level of originality with other published works and was subjected to rigorous two-step peer review before publication by two technical expert reviewers who did not include the volume editor and were independent of the volume editor, with the identities of the reviewers not revealed to the editor(s) or author(s). The reviewers were independent of the publisher, editor(s) and author(s). The publisher shared  feedback  on  the  similarity  report  and  the  reviewers'  inputs  with  the manuscript's editor(s) or author(s) to improve the manuscript. Where the reviewers recommended revision and improvements, the editor(s) or author(s) responded adequately to such recommendations. The reviewers commented positively on the scholarly merits of the manuscript and recommended that the book be published.

## Research justification

This book is centred on an in-depth analysis of original research about applying self-directed learning (SDL) within the context of curriculum, praxis, and scholarship. Several authors conducted the research. This collaborative effort brings together diverse perspectives and methodologies to enrich the understanding of SDL. The primary focus of this book is on incorporating SDL into the process of curriculum development, as well as the significance of scholarly research in the design and implementation  of  curricula.  In  addition,  the  book  discusses  the  relevance  of incorporating  technology  into  the  learning  process.  This  research  focuses  on modifying  instructional  strategies  to  accommodate  the  shifting  requirements  of higher education (HE) and school environments. The curriculum that focuses on catering to students' needs and interests, taking inspiration from constructivism, socio-constructivism  and  context-based  learning  theories,  will  be  a  topic  of discussion  in  this  book.  Moreover,  this  book  explores  practical  strategies  for educators to implement these theories effectively in diverse educational settings. As mentioned earlier, the declaration emphasises the significance of educational communities, the coherence and integration of curricular content, various pedagogical approaches and SDL.

This book provides an in-depth analysis of various subject areas connected to SDL as an alternative method of instructing students. The chapters cover research on  concepts  and  reviews,  research  on  empirical  investigations  and  research  on practical applications. The following are some of the topics that will be discussed: the  implications  of  artificial  intelligence;  strategies  for  reducing  procrastination; fostering SDL in homeschooling; enhancing SDL attributes; preparing teachers to support self-direction; facilitating curriculum transformation; implementing cooperative learning-embedded assessment; incorporating indigenous knowledge; teaching education about climate change; and integrating educational robotics. In general, this book is an extremely helpful resource for teachers who are interested in incorporating SDL into their instructional strategies. The fundamental purpose of this book is to provide academics working on the concept of SDL with empirical study findings that might act as a source of motivation for their own research and scholarly work. Specifically, the book focuses on active learning strategies that can be applied in various educational environments, including those found in schools and HE institutions.  Learners  and  students  may  benefit  from  these  approaches, which have the potential to improve their abilities for the 21st century and better prepare them for the problems that the Fourth Industrial Revolution will bring.

The editors carried out a comprehensive screening process on each chapter, using the abstracts provided to determine whether the chapters were suitable for inclusion. After that, the editors did an all-encompassing review of each chapter to ensure there was no inconsistency and to guarantee that the standards of quality were high. After this preliminary examination, the chapters underwent an external, more in-depth and more stringent peer review process directed and coordinated by AOSIS. The editors of this collection believe the essays significantly contribute to the current academic work in the fields of SDL, curriculum implementation, and praxis. In addition, to adhere to the standards established by the Department of Higher Education and Training (DHET), this publication contains original research backed by academic citations that have been subjected to stringent scrutiny. The material presented in this book is original and has not been copied entirely from another source.

An initial review of the abstracts that were submitted was carried out by the scientific committee. Following their submission, the chapters were run via Turnitin,

a software program that detects plagiarism. The editors thoroughly examined each chapter.  The  following  chapters  are  based  on  yet  significantly  revised  from dissertations: 'Continuous professional development through SDL among lecturers in curriculum transformation' by Jackie Slabbert-Redpath, Charlene du Toit-Brits and Josef de Beer; 'Towards a student-centred curriculum: The case of cooperative learning-embedded assessment' by Anitia Lubbe and Elsa Mentz; 'From classroom to  home:  Unleashing  the  power  of  self-directed  learning  in  homeschooling'  by Marguerite  Scheepers,  Jean  Henry  Blignaut  and  Charlene  du  Toit-Brits  and 'Enhancing self-directed learning: Integrating the Rationality Index of Plant Use and scientific principles in pre-service chemistry teachers' training' by Judicial Sebatana, Eunice Pretorius, Washington Dudu and Josef de Beer.

The target audience is scholars in the field of SDL within education.

The editors are positive that the book will include a large scientific discussion and, as a result, can significantly contribute to the current body of knowledge on SDL. In addition, we firmly assert that there is no evidence whatsoever of any form of plagiarism contained within the content.

Many researchers and practitioners believe that educational practices have not kept pace with the demands of the 21st century. Economies, societies and  politics  around  the  world  are  being  reshaped  by  globalisation. Expanding populations and increasing standards of living are contributing to environmental  degradation  and  diminishing  availability  of  critical resources.  Profound  changes  to  the  nature  of  modern  work  and  life, stemming  from  rapid  technological  advances,  will  likely  accelerate  with recent  developments  in  artificial  intelligence.  Yet,  despite  already  being several decades into the 'information age', many  commonly  used educational  practices  date  from  the  industrial  age.  In  addressing  these challenges,  this  scholarly  book  offers  compelling  evidence  of  how  selfdirected learning (SDL) can cultivate the knowledge and skills needed for success in the 21st century.

In  this  era  of  unprecedented change and information access, we must rethink our educational goals. Present-day knowledge, skills and tools are increasingly unlikely to be adequate for future work. Today's students must be empowered to learn throughout their lives. The solutions to increasingly complex technological, environmental and societal problems require enhanced skills not sufficiently addressed by traditional knowledge-transfer curricula. These include problem-solving, creativity, critical thinking, curiosity, collaboration  and  communication  skills,  among  others  (e.g.,  Du  Toit-Brits 2019). In an artificial intelligence (AI) world, questions of when and how to use  technology,  and  what  to  do  with  its  outputs,  become  crucial.  Those decisions, at least for the time being, are best made by humans.

Self-directed  learning,  while  not  a  new  concept,  gained  increased relevance  at  the  end  of  the  20th  century  with  the  approach  of  the information age. Crucially, unlike more traditional educational approaches, the focus of SDL is on learning rather than teaching. Originally defined by

Knowles (1975) from studies of adult education, SDL is deeply rooted in constructivism and social constructivism. Self-directed learning cultivates learners who are agents of their own learning, self-regulating, responsible for their learning, intrinsically motivated and empowered to make choices about their learning. These are many of the same skills needed for life-long learning and for success in a world characterised by rapid change. Learning with SDL is also more relevant to the learner, so learners are more motivated and the learning is more meaningful.

This book, the 14th in the AOSIS Self-Directed Learning Series, presents comprehensive evidence that SDL can be effectively implemented across diverse  educational  settings.  It  offers  practical  examples,  evidence  and analysis of numerous aspects of SDL. Each of the chapters is co-authored by scholars affiliated with the Research Unit on Self-Directed Learning at North-West University, one of the largest research centres focused on this topic.  The  book  begins  with  a  chapter  on  artificial  intelligence  and  its potential  for  individualised  and  flexible  learning,  to  revolutionise  online learning. Acknowledging the synergies between SDL and self-authorship, the authors of Chapter 2 propose a model for creating SDL environments that promote self-authorship. Chapter 3 explores how the SDL attributes of learners  and  educators  function  as  catalysts  in  achieving  curricular  and pedagogical  objectives.  Chapter  4  turns  our  attention  to  how  to  best empower teachers in training with the competencies and methodologies to  facilitate  the  development  of  SDL  among  their  learners.  Chapter  5 explores  the  crucial  role  of  SDL  interventions  in  addressing  issues  of academic procrastination. Chapter 6 returns our focus to the development of  teachers  and  proposes  that  SDL  empowers  educators  with  greater autonomy over their professional development and facilitates their ability to  continually  modify  their  instructional  approaches  in  response  to  the changing needs of their students and society. Chapter 7 offers a practical application of SDL that incorporates cooperative learning and embedded assessment in collaborative problem-solving and critical-thinking activities. Chapter 8 describes the development of SDL in pre-service teachers using block-based  programming.  Following  the  recent  COVID-19  pandemic, Chapter  9  explores  the  importance  and  value  of  SDL  in  home-school environments.  The  final  chapter  discusses  engaging  students  and  preservice teachers in chemistry through the use of indigenous knowledge in a problem-based learning setting.

In summary,  globalisation  and  rapid  technological  advances  have transformed nearly every aspect of modern life, necessitating new forms of learning both during formal education and throughout life. A self-directing

learner is especially well-equipped with the knowledge, skills and dispositions needed to adapt and thrive in a rapidly evolving world. Readers of this book will discover a wealth of examples, ideas and analyses that advocate  for  and  support  a  transition  to  this  powerful,  learner-centred pedagogy.  Together  we  can  create  a  future  where  students,  parents, educators, administrators, scholars and policymakers embrace the transformative potential of SDL.

The primary emphasis of this book is to explore the concept of self-directed learning  (SDL)  and  its  integration  into  the  curriculum.  It  examines  the practical aspects of implementing SDL and situates it within the scholarly environment. Within the dynamic landscape of education, there exists a continuous  advancement  in  our  understanding  of  pedagogy  and  the implementation of curriculum to cater for the developing needs of students and  learners  successfully.  The  book Self-Directed  Learning:  Curriculum Implementation, Praxis and Scholarship in Context is a medium for bridging theoretical  constructs  with  real-world  implementations.  This  resource provides educators, administrators and researchers with substantial material regarding the design, implementation and evaluation of the SDL curriculum. This research investigates the academic discussion surrounding the  technique  mentioned  above,  offering  a  comprehensive  guide  for understanding the contextual factors that impact SDL. Given the growing importance  of  lifelong  learning  and  SDL,  this  publication  aims  to  fill  a notable void by empowering educators to create dynamic and effective learning environments.

Chapter 1 provides an overview of the influence of artificial intelligence (AI) on online learning, which holds significant implications for SDL and curriculum  implementation.  Artificial  intelligence  has  the  potential  to revolutionise education by offering personalised and adaptable learning experiences  tailored to the specific requirements  of  each  student. E-learning  platforms  can  leverage  AI  to  analyse  extensive  data  sets, identifying individual students' strengths, weaknesses and learning

preferences, thereby facilitating the provision of customised educational materials.  Integrating  SDL  practices  enhances  student  engagement and motivation, empowering them to assume responsibility for their education and  forge  personalised  learning  trajectories.  Consequently,  educators, curriculum developers and  policymakers need  to comprehend  AI's consequences and potential advantages in online education to efficiently harness this technology and create meaningful educational opportunities in the digital age.

Du Toit-Brits, Blignaut and Wirth explore SDL's transformative potential as a pedagogical strategy to foster self-authorship in students in Chapter 2. The  central  theme  is  self-authorship,  an  empowering  process  enabling students to take control of their education and life narratives. Through SDL, students  develop  self-governance  and  self-determination,  aligning  their destinies with personal values and aspirations. The interplay between SDL and self-authorship is explored, highlighting their significant role in shaping a student's intellectual and personal identity. Thoughtfully designed SDL environments promote individual growth and enhance the overall educational experience. The chapter also examines the practical applications of  SDL  in  curriculum  implementation,  teaching  practices  and  academic scholarship. It argues that fostering self-authorship demands a fundamental re-evaluation of learning approaches, with SDL serving as an ideal vehicle for this purpose. Educators are encouraged to design learning environments to nurture self-authorship intentionally. Ultimately, ample opportunities for SDL are suggested to set the stage for developing a purposeful sense of direction in students' educational journeys.

Building  on  the  importance  of  a  fundamental  shift  in  educational approaches and for educators to create environments that support students and learners in their pursuit of SDL, personal growth and self-authorship, Chapter  3  reports  on  the  critical  importance  of  establishing  clear  and precise learning goals and objectives as a foundational step in curriculum development. They highlight the need for a flexible curriculum that can adapt to evolving learner requirements and address diverse learning styles, abilities and interests. Furthermore, the chapter stresses the significance of enhancing educators' and learners' attributes to maximise the effectiveness of curriculum and pedagogical objectives. This chapter also proposes that SDL is essential for achieving educational aims and promotes a sense of agency among learners and educators, encouraging active participation in teaching and learning, leading to better information retention, application in various contexts and improved critical thinking skills.

Chapter 4 relates to the necessity of implementing SDL practices into higher education teacher training. The impetus for higher education teacher training is to provide novice teachers with the skills and methods they need

to foster SDL among their learners. Self-directed learning is an essential education component to address this issue as it empowers learners and educators by encouraging critical thinking, problem-solving and continual learning. Furthermore, the chapter emphasises how incorporating SDL into the  curriculum  and  assisting  new  teachers  in  efficiently  implementing  it can increase student engagement and motivation. Doing so can foster a climate  of  SDL  and  initiative,  leading  to  more  meaningful  educational experiences  and  higher  academic  accomplishment.  This  chapter  clearly emphasises the importance of SDL in higher education and its potential to improve the teaching and learning processes.

Chapter  5  extends  the  importance  of  SDL  in  higher  education  by specifically  interrogating  the  significance  of  cultivating  SDL  skills  within the  context  of  higher  education  as  a  means  to  address  procrastination. Procrastination is a substantial obstacle to advancing academic pursuits and acquiring knowledge. Within this chapter, SDL skills, such as effective time management and a sense of personal responsibility, are regarded as a potential  remedy  for  procrastination,  resulting  in  more  substantial  and influential  educational  encounters.  Learning  these  skills  transcends  the confines  of  the  classroom  and  facilitates  ongoing  education.  From  this chapter,  it  is  clear  that  higher  education  institutions  are  widely  acknowledged for  their  capacity  to  improve  student  achievement  and  engagement through  strategies  aimed  at  mitigating  procrastinating  tendencies  and fostering  SDL,  thus  emphasising  the  crucial  significance  of  SDL  within higher education.

Chapter 6 highlights the importance of curriculum improvement through contextualisation, student-centred pedagogy, SDL and continuous professional  development  (CPD).  The  chapter  emphasises  the  role  of academics  as  curriculum  planners  and  designers,  stressing  the  need  to contextualise  the  curriculum,  promote  SDL,  integrate  social  justice  and decolonise content. Self-directed learning is crucial in this transformation, empowering students  to  take  control  of  their  learning,  which  enhances engagement and develops essential skills for the 21st century. Continuous professional development programmes focused on SDL equip educators with  the  skills  to  implement  student-centred  pedagogies  and  hybrid teaching approaches, fostering autonomy, self-reflection among students and transformation. As change agents, educators benefit from expanded CPD  opportunities  to  improve  their  qualifications  and  acquire  microcredentials  in  SDL  and  innovative  teaching  methods.  Curricular  training and  orientation  are  vital  for  encouraging  reflective  practices  among educators. Therefore, the authors propose a comprehensive CPD approach that emphasises SDL is essential for effective curriculum reform. Doing so prepares educators to create learning environments that support continuous improvement in teaching and learning experiences.

In Chapter 7, Lubbe and Mentz examine a curriculum that places the student at  the  centre,  emphasising  cooperative  learning-embedded  evaluation. Integrating cooperative learning and embedded assessment mechanisms into curriculum design and implementation can foster student engagement in  collaborative  problem-solving  and  critical-thinking  endeavours.  This methodology emphasises the engagement of individuals, enabling a more thorough understanding of the subject matter and promoting  the development of essential skills such as teamwork. The pedagogical strategy that  emphasises  addressing  students'  individual  needs  aligns  with  the principles of SDL practice, which promotes the cultivation of autonomous learners capable of setting goals, monitoring their progress and making informed decisions on their educational path. The authors contextualise that cooperative learning-embedded assessment is a pedagogical approach grounded  in  social  constructivism  and  draws  upon  the  social  interdependence theory.  By  adopting  this  approach,  the  organisation  of  social  interdependence is prioritised over social independence or dependency, and this approach equips students with the essential skills and attitudes required to succeed in a dynamic and constantly evolving environment.

Chapter 8 focuses on higher education institutions that must adapt to the technological breakthroughs of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR). The authors contextualise the benefits of educational robotics on higherorder cognitive skills, motivation and satisfaction. Pre-service teachers can benefit from educational robots in developing critical thinking, problemsolving and SDL skills. This chapter also presents block-based programming, digital microworld skills and self-efficacy to stimulate pre-service teachers' SDL. Data presented in this chapter revealed that pre-service education students had early academic hurdles. Students were taught critical thinking, problem-solving and coding skills like error detection and debugging. The data indicated a positive shift in students' self-efficacy perceptions, marked by  increased  motivation,  confidence  and  persistence,  concurrent  with enhancements in self-management, accountability and other SDL skills.

Our social and personal responsibilities extend beyond formal education in  this  age  of  rapid  change.  Therefore,  Chapter  9  discusses  SDL  and  its impact on many aspects of education. Because of the COVID-19 outbreak, the  international  community  has  been  forced  to  prioritise  SDL.  In  this turbulent period, home-based education is vital. This chapter analyses SDL and  its  effects  on  individuals,  focusing  on  homeschooling.  The  authors emphasise the potential for SDL to transform both children and parents who are educators and facilitators. This chapter also explains how SDL can help homeschoolers take charge of their education, develop critical thinking abilities  and  grasp  the  subject  matter.  According  to  the  authors,  SDL extends beyond conventional schooling, including extracurricular activities and lifetime learning.

The focus of the last chapter (Chapter 10) is the Rationality Index for Plant Use (RIPU) in chemistry education, which may  enhance scientific comprehension  through  SDL,  curriculum  integration  and  contextualised research. The Rationale Index for Plant Use encourages students to question the rationale of traditional plant uses, linking scientific concepts to practical applications. Incorporating this indicator into the educational programme encourages students to assume responsibility for their learning and develop into proactive students. Individuals are interested in investigating, analysing and evaluating the scientific concepts underlying plant utilisation, allowing for  SDL.  This  strategy  facilitates  the  development  of  students'  critical thinking, problem-solving and scientific knowledge. Combining traditional knowledge  with  scientific  concepts  gives  students  a  comprehensive understanding of the topic's cultural and historical context. The strategy promotes a comprehensive and interdisciplinary understanding of chemistry, academic excellence, and additional research and enquiry. The Rationality Index for Plant Use enhances SDL, curriculum implementation and academic performance in chemistry by engaging students actively in the practical applications of scientific principles.

Collectively,  the  chapters  (Chapters  1-10)  in Self-Directed  Learning: Curriculum Implementation, Praxis and Scholarship in Context demonstrate the value of this resource for educators, scholars and policymakers. This book examines the advantages of SDL in education, integration strategies and the effects on student autonomy and participation. It also contains information regarding the development of SDL educational programmes. In addition, case studies and suggestions for enhancing SDL comprehension are  included.  Detail  is  given  to  AI,  procrastination,  homeschooling  and teacher  education.  This  breadth  of  this  coverage  makes  it  valuable knowledge  and  helps  readers  comprehend  SDL's  potential  to  improve educational outcomes and equip students with critical skills for academic and professional success.

## Self-directed learning praxis and poiesis in the age of artificial intelligence

Jako Olivier

Commonwealth of Learning, Burnaby, Canada

## Abstract

The  use  of  generative  artificial  intelligence  (AI)  in  an  online  learning environment has the potential to impact self-directed learning (SDL) praxis and curriculum implementation. The potential of AI to revolutionise  the education sector lies in its ability to provide tailored and flexible learning experiences that cater to each student's distinct needs and preferences. Through AI technologies, e-learning platforms can analyse extensive data to  discern  students'  aptitudes,  deficiencies  and  learning  preferences, thereby  facilitating  the  provision  of  tailored  and  pertinent  educational materials. Furthermore,  implementing  SDL  praxis  amplifies  students' engagement and motivation and fosters SDL by enabling individuals to assume responsibility for their education and pursue customised learning trajectories.  This  research  involved  using  a  diffractive  methodology  to consider  the  implications  of  AI  for  SDL  praxis  and  poiesis  in  an  online learning environment. The chapter concludes with some practical propositions for teaching and learning.

## Introduction

If  self-directed learning (SDL) is understood as a way in which students assume an authoritative role in determining their own learning needs, goals, resources, strategies and  evaluation (Knowles  1975), then praxis is paramount for the learning process. Praxis is considered a practice that 'involves engaging in learning with an active awareness of the developmental process as it occurs' (Ritchie 2023, p. 14). Praxis implies students taking charge  of  their  learning  and  actively  engaging  in  the  learning  process. Within  a  context  where  learning  is  regarded  as  social  constructivism (Van der Walt 2016), praxis may not merely be limited to doing ( praxis ) but also creating ( poiesis ). Such an approach again emphasises the active role of  the  student  in  the  classroom  context  and  stands  in  opposition  to  an educator-centred approach.

This chapter engages with SDL regarding how this concept is considered a process (Brockett &amp; Hiemstra 2019; Merriam &amp; Bierema 2014) that builds on the social constructivist notion that active collaborative construction of knowledge is central to learning (Collis &amp; Moonen 2009). Furthermore, SDL involves some manner of independence as well as an active enquiry on the part of the student (Van Deur 2017) that relates to an authentic context (Merriam &amp; Bierema 2014). However, literature has shown how cooperation between  students  has  the  potential  to  support  learning,  especially  as regards SDL and the use of technology (Curran et al. 2019). Self-directed learning does not imply learning in isolation but rather engagement with others (Brockett &amp; Hiemstra 2019), and therefore, SDL praxis and poiesis would also reflect this.

Despite clear associations between SDL and andragogy (Knowles 1975), the relevance and scope of empirical research have extended beyond that of adult learning to all levels of education, including that of learners (Morris &amp; Rohs  2023;  Van  Deur  2017).  In  this  chapter  and  in  this  book,  the  term 'learner' is used for those studying at school level, whereas 'student' is used for  post-school studies such as at university level. Unless, of course, the terms are from direct quotations. It is evident that there has been increased datafication of education (Pedró et al. 2019), as masses of data are generated within administrative and  learning processes  in learning institutions. However, the key would be to be able to draw effectively on such data in an ethical  way  to  enhance  learning  and  effectivity  within  such  institutions. Within the context of the increasing presence of artificial intelligence (AI) in classrooms at all levels (Adiguzel, Kaya &amp; Cansu 2023; Han, Park &amp; Lee 2022; Ouyang, Zheng &amp; Jiao 2022), it is evident that AI has and will significantly influence SDL praxis and poiesis. Artificial intelligence is very relevant to education;  however,  this  phenomenon  has  recently  seen  many  rapid developments (Şenocak, Koçdar &amp; Bozkurt 2023). Despite AI being applied

in education for the past 40 years in different guises, generative AI is set to become more widespread and have far-reaching educational implications (UNESCO [United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization] 2023).  The  most  prominent  development  concerning  generative  AI  has been language and the capacity to generate language that appears to be human-like (Giannini 2023).

This conceptual chapter, using a diffractive methodology (Barad 2007, 2014), is driven by the research question: What are the implications of AI for SDL praxis and poiesis in an online learning environment? To answer this research question, some theoretical concepts had to be considered for this chapter. Consequently, SDL for praxis, poiesis and noesis, and AI and online learning are discussed through pertinent literature on these topics.

## Self-directed learning for praxis, poiesis and noesis

## The concept of self-directed learning

In this chapter and in this book, Knowles's (1975) classic definition of SDL is adopted. He describes this concept as:

[…] a process in which individuals take the initiative, with or without the help of others, in diagnosing their learning needs, formulating learning goals, identifying human  and  material  resources  for  learning,  choosing  and  implementing appropriate learning strategies and evaluating learning outcomes. (p. 18)

A narrower view of SDL would be that it 'is an intentional learning process that  is  created  and  evaluated  by  the  learner'  (International  Society  for Self-Directed Learning 2020). In both these definitions, the centrality of students is evident. However, the latter definition lacks detail on the praxis, while  Knowles's  definition  covers  several  elements  that  are  pertinent  to praxis and, ultimately, also poiesis. Self-directedness can also be considered a student characteristic, even though these two definitions do not refer to this aspect. For Brockett and Hiemstra (2019, p. 52), SDL extends beyond being centred around 'an instructional process' only; it also relates to being a  learning  characteristic  or  'personality  construct'  (Brockett  &amp;  Hiemstra 2019, p. 54). For Garrison (1997), SDL involves:

[ A ]n approach where students are motivated to assume personal responsibility and  collaborative  control  of  the  cognitive  (self-monitoring)  and  contextual (self-management) processes in constructing and confirming meaningful and worthwhile learning outcomes. (p. 18)

These three constructs - self-management, self-monitoring and motivation form  Garrison's  (1997)  SDL  model.  Self-management  emphasises  the poiesis  of  SDL,  as  it  relates  to  the  act  of  constructing  learning,  while self-monitoring pertains to students' unique role in taking charge but also

working  collaboratively.  Personal  responsibility  is  a  central  SDL  tenet (Brockett &amp; Hiemstra 2019).

Theoretically, the underlying paradigms of SDL are constructivism and specifically social constructivism. Mentz et al. (2018, pp. 171-172) note that 'through social construction of knowledge, meaning should thus emerge for active participants' in SDL. This view also supports the importance of learning as meaning-making and, by implication, collaborative and active poiesis.  Furthermore,  Merriam  and  Bierema  (2014)  acknowledge  the relevance of social constructivism for SDL. According to them, 'aspects of constructivism, especially the social construction of knowledge, are central to  self-directed  learning,  transformational  learning,  experiential  learning, reflective practice, situated cognition, and  communities  of  practice' (Merriam &amp; Bierema 2014, p. 37). As is stated here and as is evident from other works in the field, SDL has the potential to shape transformational learning  experiences  (Charokar  &amp;  Dulloo  2022).  Such  transformational learning experiences extend from praxis, poiesis and noesis.

## Praxis, poiesis and noesis

Self-directed learning implies active participation by students within the learning space and, ultimately, some process of creating with others in a real-life context. In this chapter, the two processes of doing and making are regarded  as  related  and,  at  times,  intertwined.  In  addition,  they  are interpreted in the context of the Aristotelian concept of praxis or action as well as poiesis or producing to ultimately support noesis or, in other words, understanding (Aristotle 2014). Such an understanding of SDL as praxispoiesis for noesis aligns with the theoretical underpinnings of SDL in social constructivism.

Within the context of SDL, the Aristotelian concept of praxis relates to an action done for the sake of the action itself and not to produce as is the case with poiesis. In this sense, it is all about active engagement on the side of  the  student.  When  it  comes  to  poiesis,  the  constructivist  and,  more specifically,  social  constructivist  nature  of  SDL  is  emphasised  as  it  is  all about  making  outcomes,  resources,  strategies,  artefacts  and  ways  of evaluating such processes.

Within the context of SDL, the Aristotelian conceptualisation of praxis should also be interpreted as having an aim at the end ( telos ) and involving some deliberate choice ( prohairesis ) (Aristotle 2014). Praxis is considered goal-directed, tends to imply some change and should originate from an agent itself (Bobzien 2014), and in this chapter, the agent would be the student.  Within  the  realm  of  education,  this  statement  suggests  that students assume responsibility for their learning by actively participating in classroom  activities.  In  this  context,  the  student  determines  the  goal,

and the change is also student-driven and may involve praxis and poesis. The engagement in such self-directed behaviour necessitates a favourable setting, together with the presence of encouraging peers and facilitators.

In this chapter, the case is made that there is a need to extend beyond actively engaging to creating or producing through deliberate choice. With praxis, the focus is on both form and matter; with poiesis, the emphasis is on producers applying form to what has been provided (Polansky 2014). Notably, extending AI beyond a support mechanism on the educator's part to a tool in the hands of students has significant implications for students, specifically for classroom praxis and poiesis. However, such an approach would require that online learning environments and the software used are supportive of student active engagement, production and choices.

In  this  chapter,  the  role  of  AI  should  be  seen  in  the  context  of  using digital technologies in the learning context. From the literature, it is evident that digital technologies have the potential to support students towards their self-directedness, especially with sufficient support through both SDL and technology (Morris &amp; Rohs 2023). Using such technology implies a certain environment; hence, it is relevant to consider SDL within the context of online learning environments.

## Self-directed learning and an online learning environment

The  impact  of  the  environment  in  which  learning  takes  place  is  highly relevant for SDL. Whether this is a formal or informal learning environment, the  environment  itself  may  be  conducive  to  supporting  SDL  (Beard  &amp; MacTavish  2022).  Furthermore,  online  learning  environments  have  the potential  to  provide  more  resources  for  use  by  students  (Song  &amp;  Bonk 2016) than would have been the case in face-to-face environments. More resources are available,  but  there  needs  to  be  structure,  and  the  actual learning environment needs to be considered.

Different terms are used for platforms or environments where learning can occur online. Such platforms may involve an informal set of online tools and resources, or a structured, more formal collection of tools within a learning management system (LMS). A further relevant concept is that of the virtual learning environment (VLE). Mueller and Strohmeier (2011) define VLEs as:

[ E ]lectronic information systems (IS) for the full administrative and didactical support of learning processes in (higher) education(al) and vocational training settings  by  providing  learners  with  adequate  learning  resources  to  develop intended qualifications systematically. (p. 2505)

This extensive  definition combines  both  administrative  and  didactic functions.  Furthermore,  the  environment's  role  in  providing  resources  is clear; however, the student's role in resource curation is not clear, and apart

from the vague references to the development of qualifications, little is noted about the learning process itself. Regardless of the platform type, any AI implementation would require some interface between the student and  the  software.  Hence,  mainstreaming  AI  might  imply  incorporating generative AI technologies in existing platforms and systems.

In contrast with a more generic and group-oriented environment such as an LMS, the concept of a personal learning environment (PLE) has been proposed. As an approach, PLEs allow students to select tools such as social media towards a more self-regulated approach to learning (Serhan &amp; Yahaya  2022)  and  can  potentially  support  SDL  (Conradie  2014).  By implication,  the  emphasis  on  student  choice  and  agency  could  support SDL and needs to be considered in any AI-driven intervention, as many such systems do not allow for the consultation of different resources, as discussed later in this chapter. A recent systematic review on PLEs (Serhan &amp; Yahaya 2022) has shown that both self-regulated learning (SRL) and SDL are prominent theoretical perspectives that have been researched in terms of PLEs. In this context, SRL can be considered a goal-oriented process through which students consciously make decisions and specifically strive towards identified learning goals (Molenaar et al. 2022).

Within an environment supporting SDL, Beard and MacTavish (2022) have proposed a model that may be highly relevant for SDL and hence also for this discussion. The CLEAR model involves students having the opportunity to 'choose, lead, experience, apply, and reflect' (Beard &amp; MacTavish 2022, p. 13) when using a particular environment. By implementing this model, Beard and MacTavish (2022) have observed students becoming independent and self-directed. The proposed activities are also well aligned with SDL principles set out in key literature on student-centred activities and reflection (Brockett &amp; Hiemstra 2019) and may also be used in any AI-driven process. However, to move towards generative AI in SDL praxis and poiesis,  it  is  necessary  to consider the concept of AI in the online learning context.

## Artificial intelligence and online learning

A further central concept in this chapter is that of AI for education. In this chapter, AI involves how machines can adapt to changing situations, solve problems and act in a way that shows some form of intelligence (Coppin 2004). The history of the modern conception of AI is traced back to the work of Alan Turing and the Turing test, and the term itself was coined by John McCarthy and colleagues in 1955 (Adiguzel et al. 2023; Şenocak et al. 2023). Hence, despite the recent interest in this concept, studying AI in different disciplines is not new.

The importance of AI for education is evident in integrating educational and  learning  theories  in  AI-enabled  online  learning  and  obtaining  and

analysing data throughout the learning process (Ouyang et al. 2022). In a UNESCO  working  paper  on  AI,  Pedró  et  al.  (2019,  p.  8)  highlight  four dimensions of AI: 'thinking humanly', 'thinking rationally', 'acting humanly' and 'acting rationally'. Furthermore, guidelines such as the Turing test can be used to determine the level of a system's ability to show intelligent behaviour. In this chapter, the emphasis is specifically on AI in education and not AI in general. Giannini (2023) notes how generative AI has been rolled out and made available for anyone and is faster than many previous technologies and faster than textbooks that get validated in educational contexts.

Three paradigms have been proposed for AI in education: 'Paradigm One: AI-directed, learner-as-recipient'; 'Paradigm Two: AI-supported, learner-as-collaborator'; and 'Paradigm Three: AI-empowered, learner-asleader' (Ouyang &amp; Jiao 2021, p. 3). The first paradigm draws on behaviourism, and the learning process is directed by the AI tool. In the second and third paradigms, the student drives the learning process. In the second paradigm, the student collaborates with the AI tool, reflecting a social constructivist process. As regards the third paradigm, the AI tool only supports what the student does and allows for greater personalisation and adaptive learning. The increased need for greater personalisation is supported by the 2024 EDUCAUSE Horizon Report (Pelletier et al. 2024). Adaptive learning implies customisation  and  personalisation  of  learning  for  students  through  an online system based on data and potentially using AI. Specifically, 'adaptive learning assesses where students are in the learning cycle and enables their achievement at the most effective pace' (Ice &amp; Dziuban 2023).

A significant advancement in generative AI has been the development of ChatGPT (Şenocak et al. 2023), an AI-powered chatbot developed by OpenAI (2022). ChatGPT is built on large language models that employ natural language processing and generation (Adiguzel et al. 2023; Zheng et  al.  2023).  Using  the  generative  pre-trained  transformer  (GPT)  model, ChatGPT  and  other  generative  AI  systems  can  'analyze  the  complex patterns and structures of human language, and they are primarily trained to understand and generate human language' (Bozkurt 2023, p. 200). The question remains whether the analysis of language data and the production of understandable responses imply true intelligence. As the etymology of the term 'intelligence' suggests, this concept specifically relates to being able to comprehend or understand, not merely mimicking it.

The generative AI chatbot ChatGPT is considered a useful platform for learning. In this context, ChatGPT has already been used for learning and teaching  purposes  in  different  fields,  including  chemistry  (Zheng  et  al. 2023), language (Hong 2023; Kohnke, Moorhouse &amp; Zou 2023), mathematics (Wardat et al. 2023) and nursing (Sun &amp; Hoelscher 2023), to  name a few. Baskara (2023) explored its use as a VLE. According to Baskara (2023, p. 7), this chatbot is 'capable of fostering multidisciplinary

learning and promoting collaboration across various fields of study' and also simulates 'real-world scenarios and challenges'. This kind of integration of  generative  AI  in  pedagogically  sound  systems  shows  great  promise. However, there has also been criticism about the accuracy of output from ChatGPT. Consequently, this has led to the development of additional tools to ensure correct information. An example of this is the ChatGPT Chemistry Assistant developed by Zheng et al. (2023).

Apart from the developments around ChatGPT, there has also been a trend  in  higher  education  institutions  developing  custom  generative  AI tools. One such example is the development of U-M GPT, U-M Maizey and U-M GPT Toolkit developed by the University of Michigan (2023), which is available  to  their  staff  and  students.  It  is  anticipated  that  more  such integrations will be the way in which generative AI is made readily available to students and educators.

Research has already been conducted on using AI chatbots within the education context. In this regard, Han et al. (2022) explored an AI chatbot's effect on non-face-to-face nursing classes. They found that using an AI chatbot positively affected student interest and SDL. Firat (2023, p. 61) recommends SDL, as AI tools should '[e]ncourage the adoption of AIsupported  learning  environments  that  are  personalized,  adaptive,  and responsive  to  individual  students  needs  while  promoting  self-directed learning'. Such personalisation is essential for effective SDL praxis, poiesis and noesis.

The potential of AI from both an instructional perspective and a student perspective  has  been  shown  in  the  literature  (Ouyang  et  al.  2022).  The advantages of providing adaptive and individualised support for students through AI (Jokhan et al. 2022) may also be supportive of SDL, especially in informing the activities of facilitators and the online learning experience itself. In 1986, in terms of SDL, Hiemstra (2013) proposed the idea of learning individualisation  -  the  so-called  individualised  teaching-learning  process and, ultimately, individualised instruction.

In approaching AI, specifically generative AI, critical theory of technology can be useful. In this context, the critical theory of technology allows for an approach to technologies where users' interaction and use can be explored within a specific social and historical context where the technology is not regarded as being neutral or determinist (cf. Jin et al. 2015). Here, what Feenberg (2009, p. 33) calls instrumentalisation theory is relevant at two levels: firstly, 'we seek and find affordances that can be mobilized in devices and systems by decontextualizing the objects of experience and reducing them to their useful properties'; and secondly, 'we introduce designs that can be integrated with other already existing devices and systems and with various social constraints such as ethical and aesthetic principles'.

The ethics around the use of generative AI is complex and has implications at  national  and  institutional  levels.  In  this  regard,  UNESCO  (2021)  has already published the Recommendation  on  the  Ethics of Artificial Intelligence, which  provides  clear  guidance  on  responsible  and  ethical policy  and  practices  around  AI.  The  aim  of  this  recommendation  is  'to provide  a  basis  to  make  AI  systems  work  for  the  good  of  humanity, individuals, societies and the environment and ecosystems, and to prevent harm' (UNESCO 2021, p. 14). The document also has specific recommendations relating to education and research. In this context, AI literacy and AI ethics skills are mentioned especially within the context of digital divides and access. Within the context of teaching and learning, the following very important aspects are noted (UNESCO 2021):

Member States should also ensure that AI technologies empower students and teachers and enhance their experience, bearing in mind that relational and social aspects and the value of traditional forms of education are vital in teacher-student and student-student relationships and should be considered when discussing the adoption of AI technologies in education. AI systems used in learning should be subject  to  strict  requirements  when  it  comes  to  the  monitoring,  assessment  of abilities, or prediction of the learners' behaviours. AI should support the learning process  without  reducing  cognitive  abilities  and  without  extracting  sensitive information, in compliance with relevant personal data protection standards. (p. 34)

From  this  statement,  the  emphasis  is  on  focusing  on  the  benefits  for teachers and students while also recognising the value of existing forms of education, especially the relationship between teachers and students and also  student  peers.  Furthermore, the need for requirements when using AI technologies for analytical purposes is noteworthy. Importantly, apart from  data  protection  for  classroom  AI  practices,  the  implications  for  a potential impact on cognitive abilities warrant attention in the planning for any AI-related praxis and poiesis.

It is already clear from student perceptions of AI that this could be the cause  of  anxiety  (Almaiah  et  al.  2022),  which  would  have  motivational implications for any SDL praxis and poiesis. The potential anxiety associated with students using AI systems is well articulated in a vignette written by Bozkurt (2022) in which a student's engagement  with  a  fictional AI  proctoring  system  is  relayed.  This  narrative  presents  the  key  to  the disconnect between human and AI system and the potential issues that might arise from inherent data-related bias.

In the case of ChatGPT, unlike with the technology involved with search engines such as Google, options are not provided from sets of curated data; rather, this platform provides 'authoritative-seeming responses using machine-produced content' (Giannini 2023, p. 3). Such an approach has implications for SDL, as in this case, using generative AI limits the potential resource choice of users (in the context of this chapter, students).

The  concepts  of  a  learning  platform  or  a  specific  AI-driven  tool  are mentioned throughout this chapter; however, if SDL is to be understood from  the  perspective  of  lifelong  learning  (Brockett  &amp;  Hiemstra  2019; Charokar  &amp;  Dulloo  2022),  then  AI-supported  learning  should  also  be considered  independent  from  a  single  platform  or  through  applications that can be used independently in various contexts.

Considering these theoretical concepts, a diffractive methodology was used to steer the interpretation and presentation of certain propositions in this chapter. The diffractive methodology is unpacked and then employed to facilitate a systematic diffractive analysis of critical sources related to SDL praxis, SDL poiesis and AI in education.

## Methodology

A diffractive methodology was employed for this conceptual chapter to explore the implications of AI for SDL praxis and poiesis. Diffraction refers to how different intersecting concepts or waves are considered regarding their superposition and interferences (Barad 2007, 2014). So, in the same way different waves react when they engage with each other in nature, the concepts are considered and analysed in this chapter. Furthermore, this approach was used to consider SDL praxis and poiesis together with AI, not as it relates to their similarities, but rather their inherent differences and potential conflicts regarding knowledge-making (Bozalek &amp; Zembylas 2018). To this end, the research involved a systematic diffractive analysis of critical sources related to SDL praxis, SDL poiesis and AI in education.

Towards considering the diffractive entanglements between SDL and AI in online environments, a selection of pertinent key sources was identified and  approached  through  a  process  of re-turning .  Barad  (2014,  p.  168) describes  this  process  as  turning  to  the  texts  over  and  over  again  and hence, 'iteratively intra-acting, re-diffracting, diffracting anew, in the making of  new  temporalities  (spacetimematterings),  new  diffraction  patterns'. Owing to the nature of this process, interpretations, although rigorous, are subjective when it comes to source selection.

However, for the sake of the scientific integrity of this diffractive process, it was essential to ensure the trustworthiness of the analysis. In this regard, credibility, dependability, transferability, as well as confirmability (Denscombe  2021;  Lincoln  &amp;  Guba  1986)  were  considered  in  the  data analysis. Such an analysis and method of ensuring trustworthiness is more fitting within a pragmatic research paradigm (Denscombe 2021).

This analysis implied critical engagement  with  different sources, cross-checking and thick descriptions of the data. The following discussion presents  entanglements  between  SDL  and  AI  in  online  environments

towards  reaching  some  proposed  propositions  that  could  inform  praxis within  the  curriculum.  This  process  specifically  involved  a re-turning (Barad 2014) to Knowles's conceptualisation of SDL praxis and poiesis of AI in online environments.

## Diffractive entanglements between self-directed learning and artificial intelligence in online environments

Before  certain  propositions  could  be  established,  inevitable  diffractive entanglements were explored to assess AI's effects on SDL praxis and poiesis in  an  online  learning  environment.  Consequently,  the  discussion  of  the research  conducted  for  this  chapter  involves  considering  learning  needs diagnosis, learning goals formulation, resource identification, learning strategy selection and implementation, and learning outcomes evaluation.

## Learning needs diagnosis

Needs assessment is essential to SDL (Brockett &amp; Hiemstra 2019). This step informs the telos or goal formulation and directly impacts the praxis and poiesis. Such a diagnosis is personal and individual to the student but is often  realised  socially  within  a  classroom  or  learning  environment  with peers.  The  potential  exists  for  effective  learning  needs  diagnosis  with AI-driven tools because, in essence, any diagnosis is data-driven. A concrete example  of  probing  student  needs  through  generative  AI  in  support  of SDL would be the generative AI chatbot application, called TeacherGAIA, which was developed by Ali et al. (2023). Here student needs are considered through prompts, and interactions are then structured based on responses apart from supporting SDL. This research also shows promise in terms of self-assessment.

It  has  been  noted how AI-driven tools increase motivation as well as engagement (Adiguzel et al. 2023). Currently, a challenge of AI - and more specifically  generative  AI  technology  such  as  ChatGPT  -  is  that  it  lacks contextual awareness and true understanding, as its comprehension is only based on language patterns and structures derived from the data used in its  training  (Bozkurt  2023;  Giannini  2023;  Sun  &amp;  Hoelscher  2023).  It  is critical that learning needs diagnosis be considered as both an individual step towards praxis and poiesis and a contextualised one. Such an approach implies in-depth knowledge, in other words, data about the students and their  immediate context. These data involve socio-cultural, geographical and other location-bound properties and contextual factors relevant to a specific learner. Contextualisation at a personal level could also address the unique requirements of learners with disabilities or diverse learning needs.

Importantly, AI-driven tools have the potential to differentiate and support students with different needs. From the literature, it is clear how such tools can  positively  affect  students  with  learning  disabilities  and  may  even reduce  anxiety  among  students  (Adiguzel  et  al.  2023).  This  aspect emphasises  the  need  for  contextualisation,  as  individual  student  needs may vary significantly based on existing dispositions. From this process of identifying needs, certain goals for learning can be set. Based on students' reactions and inputs to prompts, generative AI could have a significant role to  play  in  helping  students  diagnose  their  needs.  For  the  educator  and broadly  for  educational  institutions,  such  data  would  provide  valuable information on the common needs of a class or even an institution. The hope would be that online learning environments and AI systems would allow for easy and ethical access to such data. Similarly, such data may also contribute to the formulation of learning goals.

## Learning goals formulation

As per the definition of SDL presented earlier in this chapter, students need to be able to set their own goals. As noted before, this concept relates to what Aristotle (2014) called the telos or goal at the end. This individualised, contextualised telos guides  learning  and  is  a  way  to  assess  whether understanding or noesis was reached. However, reaching such a goal could extend beyond understanding and imply praxis and poiesis.

Within  highly  structured  learning  environments,  such  as  schools  and higher  education  institutions  (HEIs),  learning  goal  formulation  is  often informed by external variables such as course and lesson outcomes and professional  regulatory  requirements.  In  a  context  where  constructive alignment  is  prevalent,  there  are  certain  limitations  regarding  student choice outcomes. Biggs (2014, p. 5) defines constructive alignment as 'a design for teaching in which what it is intended students should learn, and how they should express their learning, is clearly stated before teaching takes place'. It is common in university contexts for broad outcomes to be determined in advance by the institution through the educator or even, in some cases, external regulatory bodies. The educator may also determine outcomes within the scope of a lesson, whether online or in person. With the inclusion of generative AI in the equation with the existing presence of constructive  alignment  practices  at  universities,  the  need  for  SDL  and greater flexibility in the teaching space, the teaching negotiation process for educators becomes quite complex.

However,  using  ChatGPT,  for  example,  generative  AI  can  be  used  to generate goals, set goals and support SDL development (Lin 2023). Within this context, adaptive learning environments have the potential to support student goal setting through the recognition of problem-solving goals, as was

illustrated by Goslen et al. (2022), this was performed in game-based learning environments. As with the needs diagnosis, goal formulation could draw on historical data of students as well as provide data based on prompts. The level  of  educator  intervention  would  of  course  depend  on  the  nature  of constructive  alignment  in  the  institution,  the  institution's  commitment  to SDL and especially within the context of AI systems, which do not currently allow  for  access  to  feedback  in  the  backend  necessarily,  whether  or  not educator  intervention  is  technically  possible.  A  further  example  of  using ChatGPT for goal formulation is the process suggested by Rakap (2023) which showed how ChatGPT could be used to support goal setting by novice teachers, specifically within the context of the development of individualised education programme goals for children with autism.

In any case, at the level of praxis and poiesis, this would imply some form of negotiation between the student and the external entity, even if this is not as overt and formalised. The challenge would be determining how AI-driven tools can support such a process. From goal formulation, the emphasis then shifts to resource identification.

## Resource identification

Resource selection is an important step towards SDL, as the needs and goals of each learning process and each student are unique, so the resources should also be individually and contextually suited for the relevant learning praxis  and  poiesis.  Regarding  AI-driven  tools,  such  resources  extend  to human and material resources, as was Knowles's (1975) original intention with SDL. Here, human resources may imply drawing on different expertise in  language and technology, whereas in an online environment, material resources may be endless in scope. However, in this chapter, the focus is more on the latter iteration.

A key concern regarding SDL and introducing AI-based technologies in the  learning  space  is  that  this  might  imply  bringing  in  another  'content transmitter' (cf. Knowles 1975). Consequently, on the side of a facilitator or in the  design  of  learning  environments,  opportunities  for  active  critical engagement with the technology should be considered. However, the ability of AI-driven tools to analyse and interpret massive amounts of data shows promise in providing the most suitable resource that applies to the specific context, class, group and individual. An example of resource identification can be found in the research by ElSayary (2024) where case studies are discussed through which learning is personalised through adjustments in content delivery or even changes in the complexity of content.

Students  could  be  supported  towards  becoming  self-directed  in resource identification through prompts  and  case-based facilitation

in LMSs.  In  this  regard,  Charokar  and  Dulloo  (2022)  suggest  using case-based scenarios to guide students in using questions to lead them to answers through specific learning resources. Again, when developing such an approach, there might be inherent tension regarding what the educator's role would be in determining the relevant cases and their contents. Ideally, some form of curation should ensure contextualised and localised content.

There  is  also  an  opportunity  for  significant  facilitator  involvement  in resource identification. While a facilitator may have a minor role in selecting materials, they play a more prominent role in guiding students through the process  and  helping  them  recognise  reliable,  relevant  and  high-quality resources. The importance of the teaching presence was noted in research on SDL and online environments. This aspect is especially significant when supporting students' self-monitoring, and teaching presence is related to students'  cognitive  presence  (Zhu  et  al.  2023).  A  further  aspect  of importance is students' selection and implementation of specific learning strategies.

## Learning strategy selection and implementation

Regarding  the  conceptualisation  of  praxis  in  this  chapter,  the  strategy selection  and  implementation  process  both  entail  doing  what  Aristotle (2014) called praxis and poiesis, which involve production and creation. This view, in turn, aligns with SDL's roots in constructivism (Simons 2000). This aspect of SDL relates to what is performed for praxis and poiesis and how it occurs. In this context, AI-driven tools may be the focus but also the means to  an  end  -  this  depends  on  the  followed  AI  paradigm  and  the identified learning goals.

Individualisation of learning strategies through adaptive learning can be facilitated  with  an  intelligent  tutoring  system  that  employs  adaptive sequencing of selected learning activities (Shabana, Lakshminarayanan &amp; Anil 2022).  In  this case, it is proposed  that  a  multi-armed  bandit algorithm and a change point detection algorithm are combined to allow for effective personalisation.  It has  been  noted  how,  in  AI-enabled environments, individualised assessments and guidance can be provided (Adiguzel et al. 2023).

The potential of AI for learning personalisation is evident through an AI-empowered student-as-leader paradigm (Ouyang &amp; Jiao 2021) and the use of AI-based scaffolded learning environments (Umutlu &amp; Gursoy 2022). Such individualisation shows the greatest potential promise in supporting SDL, as the environment can then be customised to the exact needs and goals determined by the student. In terms of a concrete example, research by Marquardson (2024) has shown how SDL can be fostered through the

active  use  of  ChatGPT  by  students  through  student-driven  topic  and resource selection as well as execution of student-created learning plans.

Within  this  context,  specific  new  literacies  and  skills  are  needed  to effectively  use  AI  tools  for  educators  and  students  (Firat  2023;  Sun  &amp; Hoelscher 2023). Any implementation for the sake of SDL requires applying skills within a specific context and developing a proper understanding of the pertinent principal skills (Ritchie 2023). As much as the scaffolding of strategies supporting SDL is necessary for SDL praxis and poiesis, support of  language  and  technical  skills  is  needed  when  using  AI-driven  tools. At the end of the learning process, there is also a need to evaluate whether the learning outcomes were reached.

## Learning outcomes evaluation

The process of SDL involves not only planning and implementation but also the evaluation of learning (Brockett &amp; Hiemstra 2019). In this regard, the student would consider the set goals and evaluate whether the outcomes were reached. This process can be considered the essence of the reflection and assessment process inherent in all learning.

The potential of generative AI for assessment is significant. On a surface level,  Wang  et  al.  (2022)  found  that  large  pre-trained  language  models could generate relevant quality questions that could not be distinguished from human-authored questions. However, AI-driven tools may have value at  all  levels  of  learning  outcome  evaluation  in  that  they  may  not  just contribute to determining how assessment can take place but also act as an assessment in curating the data generated by students throughout the learning process. For example, Mogavi et al. (2024) emphasise the need for considering learning outcomes in terms of gauging learning rather than artefacts, and this will also have implications for student outcome evaluation.

As regards assessment, AI-driven tools allow for differentiating assessments based on students' abilities, monitoring and collecting various multimodal data (Adiguzel et al. 2023; Cotton, Cotton &amp; Shipway 2023) to inform  any  learning  outcomes  evaluation.  Such  systems  also  have  the potential  to  predict  student  progress  and  engagement  (Adiguzel  et  al. 2023; Firat 2023) and so allow for individualised intervention through the learning platform or by a facilitator. Consequently, AI-driven tools could support students and learning, act diagnostically, inform different aspects of  formative  and  summative  assessment,  and  contribute  to  identifying trends and determining future planning.

From  these  discussed  diffractive  entanglements,  several  propositions have been derived. These propositions may inform further SDL praxis and poiesis regarding AI in higher education and even other educational contexts.

## Propositions: Towards self-directed learning praxis and poiesis with artificial intelligence

In  the  spirit  of  a  diffractive  methodology,  this  chapter  does  not  make recommendations or prescribe any application. Instead, some propositions (cf. Murris &amp; Bozalek 2019) are presented from the diffractive re-turning to SDL praxis and poiesis of AI in online environments. In this chapter, there are at least two levels of entanglement by means of diffraction: SDL and praxis-poiesis and then SDL and AI. The first level of entanglement, which relates to SDL and specifically praxis, extends beyond this chapter and is also evident in subsequent chapters dealing with praxis in various contexts. As such, the interference of waves between SDL and praxis as concepts propagate throughout the book.

In this section, the focus is specifically on the entanglement between SDL and praxis-poiesis on the one side and specifically AI on the other. Regarding praxis and poiesis, the focus is on the student and their choices of resources and the learning process as a whole. In the SDL literature, the emphasis on the learning process of the individual is evident (Brockett &amp; Hiemstra 2019). It is noted in the literature that self-directed students are competent, causal reasoners (Lapidow &amp; Walker 2022). Hence, through a process  of  Aristotelian prohairesis or  deliberate  choice,  students  act  or make  and,  by  implication,  learn.  All  of  these  happen  within  a  specific process that others may or may not facilitate (Brockett &amp; Hiemstra 2019). It  is  already  clear  that  apart  from  the  potential  that  systems  such  as ChatGPT hold, they limit choices, as feedback is provided in the form of a definitive  answer  (Giannini  2023)  that  may  also  be  decontextualised. Mogavi et al. (2024, p. 18) highlight the potential of generative AI to possibly 'limit  critical  thinking  and  creativity,  impede  a  deep  understanding  of subject matter, and foster laziness and passivity'.

Diffraction implies some form of interference or influence, and as such in considering the dynamics between SDL and praxis-poiesis, SDL implies a  student-centred  process  which  in  this  case  is  focused  on  praxis  and poiesis as active creation underlies the learning process. However, within the context of using generative AI, on the one hand, this may imply greater individualisation and resources, and on the other hand, the praxis and even poiesis  may  be  transferred  to  an  AI  system  where  the  ultimate  goal  is merely an artefact that is submitted rather than learning itself.

As such, it  is  imperative  to  ensure  that  AI-driven  platforms  allow  for conditions with adequate balance 'between the learner's level of self-direction and the extent to which opportunity for self-directed learning is possible' (Brockett &amp; Hiemstra 2019, p. 63). It is necessary to determine

the  role  of  AI-driven  tools  and  human  facilitators  in  the  learning  space regarding  facilitation  and  as  a  resource.  In  research  conducted  by  Lin (2023) regarding the possible role ChatGPT can play as a facilitator towards motivating SDL, it is noted that there is a need for 'instructors' that can guide students in generating appropriate prompts and that the level of engagement  between  platform  and  human  facilitator  must  be  carefully considered. There have also been attempts at creating applications using ChatGPT  and  embedding  them  in  practices  supporting  SRL  (Wu  et  al. 2024).  Consequently,  apart  from  the  technology  itself,  the  practices instituted by  administrators,  educators  and,  ultimately,  the  students themselves would determine the success of any AI-driven interventions.

As it is relevant to consider to what extent AI-driven platforms can fulfil educator  roles,  one  can  draw  on  the  six  facilitation  roles  identified by  Hiemstra  (2013)  and  reflect  on  the  diffractive  entanglement  with generative AI:

- · Content resource: Content in different formats chosen based on field content, student data and system-driven conversations.
- · Resource locator: Locating and sharing of resources or even facilitated searches with system support.
- · Interest  stimulator:  Engagement  with  students  through  prompts  to activate interest.
- · Positive attitude generator: Building confidence through verbal interaction  and  feedback  based  on  student  activities  on  the  learning platform.
- · Creativity  and  critical  thinking  stimulator:  System-driven  discussions and simulations.
- · Evaluation stimulator: Prompting and feedback to students based on student targets set and activities on the learning platform.

Furthermore,  from  empirical  research  carried  out  on  an  online  platform designed  to  let  students  engage  with  praxis  towards  supporting  SDL, Ritchie  (2023,  p.  21)  determined  that  to  facilitate  a  practice  of  praxis, students should 'actively reflect, acknowledging the self in learning and how they are mentally and physically impacted by, progress through, and interact with their surroundings and others'. The potential of drawing on data to create real-world scenarios and authentic contexts, as was found in activities  using  ChatGPT  (Baskara  2023),  also  shows  promise  towards supporting  SDL.  However,  it  is  important  to  avoid  over-dependence  on AI systems (Alier, García-Peñalvo &amp; Camba 2024).

Before  getting  to  praxis  and  poiesis,  both  the  educator  as  facilitator and the student should be skilled sufficiently to use any generative AI tool or platform or have ' AI fluency' (Pelletier et al. 2024). Firat (2023, p.  61)  recommends  a  'focus  on  integrating  critical  thinking,  creativity,

problem-solving,  and  digital  literacy  skills  as  explicit  learning  outcomes and  experiential  competencies  within  course  and  curriculum  design'. The need for educator training is also highlighted in the literature (Wardat et al.  2023). Such praxis and poiesis also require access, and within the context of increased AI use, the issue of the digital divide, where equitable access to technology is different between contexts, is still highly relevant as  is  evidenced  in  the  2024  EDUCAUSE  Horizon  Report  (Pelletier  et  al. 2024). Capacity building of educators and students around plagiarism and the tools involved in generative AI is also essential (Cotton et al. 2023). Conversely, in the Global Education Monitoring Report ,  UNESCO (2023) makes the following significant remark in this regard:

[ F ]aced with new technology tools, the ideal response is unlikely to be further specialization in technology-related domains; rather, it is a balanced curriculum that maintains if not strengthens and improves the delivery of arts and humanities to  reinforce  learners'  responsibility,  empathy,  moral  compass,  creativity  and collaboration. (p. 13)

In this statement, the need for a balanced approach to curriculum is evident. The  implication  is  that  for  praxis  and  poiesis,  capacity  should  be  built through skills related to technology, specifically a broader range of skills relevant  to  the  AI  context.  Moreover,  as  Giannini  (2023)  recommends, generally, knowledge creation should not be delinked from human beings which  in  a  diffractive  reading  may  be  the  case  with  unsystematic  and irresponsible AI integration.

A  further  issue  when  using  generative  AI  tools  or  platforms  is  the accuracy of output (Adiguzel et al. 2023; Sun &amp; Hoelscher 2023). As such tools  rely  on  the  accuracy  of  the  data  they  build  on,  currently,  caution should  be  taken.  Inaccuracies  in  output  and  the  need  for  checking  by experts are evident (Wardat et al. 2023). Similarly, AI systems as sources of authority should be carefully considered (Giannini 2023).

Ethical issues in using AI are considered important in the literature on AI in education (Sun &amp; Hoelscher 2023). Artificial intelligence tools rely not only on initial  data  but  also  on  learning  based  on  feedback  and  further inputs  from  users.  This  has  specific  implications  for  data  security  and privacy  (Adiguzel  et  al.  2023).  There  is  also  the  potential  for  abuse, deception  and  bias  through  such  systems  (Adiguzel  et  al.  2023;  Sun  &amp; Hoelscher 2023). The prospect of using such tools to aid plagiarism has also been widely stated (Adiguzel et al. 2023; Cotton et al. 2023), and this may imply changes in how assessment should be carried out (Firat 2023). In the 2024 EDUCAUSE Horizon Report (Pelletier et al. 2024), the following recommendation is made:

If you find that an AI tool can easily accomplish an assignment without human involvement,  consider  revising  the  assignment  to  focus  on  the  important human-learning objectives. (p. 22)

Considering the diffractive entanglements between SDL and AI in online environments in this chapter, it might be sensible to consider this role of technology  with the same  scepticism  as Candy  (2004).  Evidently, educational AI tools do not sufficiently draw on general pedagogical or instructional  approaches  (Adiguzel  et  al.  2023).  Hence,  it  might  be necessary to wait until the emerging technologies are broadly accepted, all involved are sufficiently  trained,  and  the  motivation  for  the  use  of  such technologies has gone beyond the novelty of the technology and instead is driven  by  pragmatism.  The  role  students  and  educators  will  play  in  the mainstream use of AI is also an important consideration. In this regard, Giannini (2023, p. 4) states that 'education systems need to return agency to  learners  and  remind  young  people  that  we  remain  at  the  helm  of technology'.  This  agency  is  critical  not  just  for  establishing  a  measured approach to AI but also for creating a conducive environment for SDL.

## Conclusion

This analysis showed how considering the diverging concepts of SDL praxis and poiesis together with AI uncovers and causes certain conflicting and potentially disruptive consequences for the wider education context. The need for SDL praxis and poiesis is evident and notable in how learning and assessment activities could be considered on a continuum between praxis and poiesis towards a student-focused noesis. The chapter also provides a theoretical  implementation  framework  for  SDL  praxis  and  poiesis  in AI-enabled  online  learning.  The  chapter  concludes  with  some  practical propositions  around  the  roles  and  activities  of  students  and  educators within an AI-enabled online learning context.

Within the context of the methodology employed for this chapter, the process of diffraction of considering SDL praxis and poiesis in terms of AI is incomplete and warrants dynamism. The concept of interrogating the self and others, as discussed by Barad (2014), involves moving beyond the individual learning process of SDL and transforming it into a collective and dynamic social act of disruption and learning. In online learning contexts, as the case will increasingly be with AI, a deconstruction would be ongoing regarding how learning, teaching, facilitating and even self-directedness could be understood. In conclusion, it is only through a repeated re-turning to the ideas presented here and in the following chapters that curriculum implementation, praxis and scholarship within the context of SDL could be comprehended.

In  a  vignette  by  Bozkurt  (2022),  the  interactions  between  a  student and an AI-powered online system during an examination are described. This extreme and alarming narrative shows the result of taking the educator as a facilitator out of the formal learning context. When student emotions

lead to potential misidentification or assessment is influenced by perceived aggression  or  critical  thought  being  misconstrued  as  bias,  the  learning agency  is  shifted  from  student  to  system.  As  AI  is  introduced  in  more aspects of the learning sphere, so should the question be asked whether, as is performed by Alim in Bozkurt's (2022) vignette, we will merely accept the grade or try and defend what it means to be human when engaging with online systems for learning. In the next chapter, the implementation and praxis of the SDL curriculum are further explored as a path to selfauthorship, continuing the proposed diffractive reading of SDL and praxis introduced in this chapter.

## Abstract

This  chapter  explored  the  potential  of  self-directed  learning  (SDL)  as  a transformative teaching and learning strategy for promoting self-authorship - a process that empowers students to take charge of both their education and life narratives. Through development as self-directing learners, students cultivated  essential  qualities  such  as  self-governance,  self-determination and the ability to author their destinies in alignment with their individual

values  and  aspirations.  Central  to  our  discussion  was  the  harmonious relationship  between  SDL  and  self-authorship.  Through  examination  of their symbiotic goals, we highlighted the significance of these constructs in shaping  a  student's  intellectual  and  personal  identity.  When  SDL environments are thoughtfully designed and effectively executed, they not only foster individual growth but also strengthen the overall educational experience,  making  it  more  enduring  and  impactful.  In  this  chapter,  we explored the practical applications of SDL in curriculum design, teaching praxis and academic scholarship. We contend that fostering self-authorship requires a fundamental re-evaluation of our approach  to learning. Furthermore,  we  argue  that  SDL  serves  as  an  ideal  vehicle  for  selfauthorship. Through  a  holistic understanding  of these applications, educators will be better equipped to create learning environments that are intentionally  designed to nurture self-authorship. Ultimately, we suggest that by providing students with ample opportunities for SDL, one also sets the stage for the development of a rich and purposeful sense of direction in their educational journeys.

## Introduction

Following  the  exploration  of  the  transformative  potential  of  artificial intelligence (AI) for fostering self-directed learning (SDL) in online learning environments presented in Chapter 1, this chapter dives into the realm of SDL environments. While the previous chapter highlighted AI's capacity to  customise  educational  experiences  for  SDL,  the  focus  now  shifts  to cultivating  SDL  environments  to  enhance  self-authorship.  In  learning  to assume greater agency in the SDL environment, students also develop the knowledge, skills and habits of mind to take agency over their educational and life journeys. Together, these chapters paint a picture of how technology and pedagogical strategies can be harmoniously integrated and leveraged to empower learners in the digital age.

The educational domain comprises a rich tapestry of interwoven and diverse  perspectives.  Among  these,  SDL,  experiential  learning  and transformational learning are prominent pedagogical approaches, each contributing distinctively to educational theory and practice. Our emphasis in this chapter was on SDL's role as a transformative approach in teaching and learning, particularly in its potential to foster curriculum implementation, praxis and the scholarship of self-authorship. By delving into how SDL cultivates self-governance and empowerment in students, we underscored its  significance  in  allowing  students  to  actively  shape their educational destinies.

Recognised  for  its  versatility  and  dynamism,  SDL  complements  and challenges  many  other  traditional  educational  practices.  Self-directed

learning  can  uphold  existing  educational  practices  while  significantly changing  conventional  teaching  and  learning  approaches.  In  addition, SDL's inherent versatility situates it prominently  within  the diverse landscape of educational methodologies (cf. Guglielmino 2013; Knowles, Holton &amp; Swanson 2015).

Central to our discussion was the concept of the self in education - an inherent source of learning that forms the basis for acquiring knowledge and individual development (Guglielmino 2008, 2013). Rather than a mere passive recipient of knowledge, the self is an engaged participant, actively constructing personal knowledge and understanding. This shift underpins the broader evolution of modern education, which seeks to mould students into  autonomous  learners  who  are  capable  of  self-development,  selfdetermination and self-regulation (Du Toit-Brits 2018b).

In creating SDL environments for nurturing self-authorship, we emphasised the importance of student agency and ownership. Such an environment  fosters  a  profound  sense  of  self-authorship;  however,  it nurtures a lifelong commitment to continuous SDL and equips students to navigate in a complex and rapidly changing world (cf. King &amp; Siddiqui 2011).

Our ambitions for this chapter were twofold: to contribute meaningfully to the SDL discourse and to nurture the development of individuals who possess both a comprehensive understanding of academic content and a deep-rooted sense of self (cf. King &amp; Siddiqui 2011). Such individuals can critically engage with the world and make informed educational and life decisions. Finally, we made recommendations for establishing educational environments that promote SDL and self-authorship. We aimed to illuminate pathways for reshaping education while also championing the emergence of more empowered and resilient individuals in the modern world.

## Nurturing meaning-making and selfauthorship through self-directed learning

In the current educational milieu, the primary objective is to foreground the facilitation  of  meaning-making  through  learning  -  a  paradigm  that  has gained  prominence  in  education  (Ancess  2003;  Du  Toit-Brits  2018b).  In teaching and learning that aims to promote understanding, students are encouraged to explore their own thoughts and ideas, which helps them develop  their  intellectual  landscape  and  enhance  their  ability  to  learn independently. Moreover, the exigency of scholastic triumph for all students underscores the pedagogical panorama (Du Toit-Brits 2018b). Achieving this laudable  goal  necessitates  educators  to  methodically  craft  and amalgamate pedagogical content and delivery, fostering an environment that  empowers students to engage with learning on their terms and to

assume  ownership  of  their  academic  trajectory  (Ancess  2003;  Baxter Magolda &amp; King 2004; Kegan 1994).

The cultivation of meaning-making presupposes a dynamic comprehension  of  learning,  challenging  the  passivity  that  characterises students  as  mere  recipients  of  knowledge.  The  vitality  of  a  learning community wherein knowledge is wielded as an instrument of empowerment is unmistakable (Baxter Magolda &amp; King 2007; Du Toit-Brits 2018a; Ryan &amp; Deci 2000). In this intricate tapestry, educators bear the mantle of nurturing a growth mindset, instilling cognitive agility, reflective thinking, problemsolving  understanding  and  responsiveness.  With  support  from  various scholarly  sources,  a  pedagogical  approach  towards  meaning-making  is presented  as  one  centred  on  customised  learning  objectives,  a  strong awareness of students' developmental trajectories and a commitment to promoting their intellectual progress and identity development (cf. King &amp; Siddiqui 2011). This holistic ambition transcends formal curriculum limitations  and invites educators to weave a culture of meaning-making into the educational fabric (Baxter Magolda &amp; King 2007; Blignaut 2021; Kegan 1994; Verster, Mentz &amp; Du Toit-Brits 2018), a change attainable via the educational framework's hidden and unspoken aspects.

Kegan's  theoretical  underpinning  of  meaning-making  elucidates  the intricate process by which individuals forge an understanding of themselves, their capacities and their cognitive landscapes (Ancess 2003; Kegan 1994). Meaning-generation transpires within the crucible of the learning experience and  is  shaped  by  the  individual's  responses.  Kegan's  theoretical  edifice further  underscores  the  pivotal  role  of  internal  cognitive  architecture  in engendering meaning-making, thereby propelling the evolution of the self (Kegan 1994). This transformation unfolds gradually, informed by experiential encounters and temporal progression. The Keganian schema posits six comprehensive configurations of meaning-making, characterised as 'orders of consciousness' (Baxter Magolda &amp; King 2007; Kegan 1994). As students navigate these cognitive realms, their meaning-making endures transformative  shifts,  entailing  reconfigurations  of  self-perception  and interpretative insights.

The  Keganian  schema  is  a  profound  and  enlightening  conceptual framework within  human  awareness  and  cognitive  growth  (Kegan  1982, 1994). These orders include psychological development phases and serve as gateways to comprehending the fundamental nature of our being and the transformative quest for self-consciousness (Kegan 2000). Central to Kegan's thesis is the notion that our cognitive understanding of the external environment,  our  construction  of  personal  identity  and  our  ability  to navigate  intricate  concepts  undergo  developmental  progression  (Baxter Magolda 2008).

The first stage of awareness - the impulsive mind - serves as the point of origin  for  this  expedition  (Kegan  2000).  In  this  context,  the  global perspective prioritises immediate gratification and the fundamental need for survival. In contemporary society, human behaviour is often driven by desires and necessities as individuals navigate a complex web of stimuli and  responses.  As  we  transition  to  the  second  level,  the  human  mind distinguishes itself from these innate urges. The emergence of the socialised mind is characterised by its adherence to external rules and ideals, leading to a sense of compliance (Wertsch 1985). This phase signifies the emergence of self-consciousness, as people start scrutinising the societal norms and values they have absorbed. The third level of cognitive development - the self-authoring mind -assumes control over one's autonomy and independence.  In  this  context,  people  are  emancipated  from  external sources of authority and establish their values and beliefs. Individuals craft their narratives, assuming the role of writers in shaping their life trajectories. Commencing one's life story is essential at this juncture as it marks the transition  to  a  phase  of  greater  autonomy,  empowerment  and  selfdetermination.

However, Kegan's schema does not conclude at this point. The fourth order - the self-transforming mind - represents a significant advancement in consciousness,  characterised  by  a  quantum  jump.  The  individual acknowledges  the  constraints  of  their  viewpoint  and  welcomes  the perpetual state of change in existence. In this context, the dissolution of the ego occurs when individuals negotiate intricate situations with a sense of  modesty  and  receptiveness.  The  fifth  and  sixth  orders  -  namely,  the integral and the transpersonal minds - represent the pinnacle of human awareness.  The  individual  transcends  their  ego  and  unites  with  the interwoven fabric of all reality. The integrative perspective acknowledges the interconnectedness of many elements within the human experience, aiming to cultivate a sense of harmony within this intricate fabric (Kegan 2000; Wertsch 1985). In the culmination of this exposition on the Keganian schema, we arrive at a significant point of intersection. This intersection is a reminder that self-discovery and personal development are continuous and dynamic (cf. King &amp; Siddiqui 2011). Within this framework, this chapter aligns harmoniously with the contours of Kegan's fourth order, establishing itself as a conceptual scaffold.

Broadening the vista to encompass the significance of meaning-making, a focused exploration of Kegan's fourth order becomes imperative. In this cognitive terrain, individuals strive to nurture their constructs of meaning, a  domain  wherein  self-authorship  emerges  as  a  pivotal  facet  (Baxter Magolda  2008;  Kegan  1994).  The  'residents'  of  this  realm  cultivate  the faculty  to  discern  and  embrace  personal  standards,  both  autonomously and in synergy with others. This cognitive domain finds manifestation in

instances where individuals coalesce their insights, crafting their interpretations  of  knowledge  or  experiential  episodes  and  subsequently embedding these self-forged constructs within their educational odyssey (Ignelzi 1994). This self-authored conceptual tapestry imbues the 'self' with a  symbolic  identity,  accentuating  the  role  of  self-directedness,  critical thinking, accountability, self-determination and problem-solving acumen.

This  chapter  postulates  the  indispensability  of  cultivating  an  SDL environment, encapsulating the attributes of maturity, autonomy, empowerment and a growth-oriented cognitive disposition. This educational orchestration beckons students to perceive themselves as cocreators within the pedagogical tapestry, operating firmly in the precincts of purpose and perseverance. This co-creative symbiosis, emblematic of educators and students collaboratively shaping curricular components and pedagogical  paradigms,  manifests  pedagogical  ingenuity  (Bovill  et  al. 2016).  However,  implementing  co-creation  entails  nuanced  curriculum implications interwoven with the tapestry of teaching and learning. A group of  scholars  -  including  Baxter  Magolda  and  King  (2007),  Kegan  (1994), Khiat (2015), Knowles et al. (2015) and Verster et al. (2018) - endorses the premises elucidated herein.

Considering the preceding discourse, it becomes imperative to underline that the vitality of co-creating a pedagogical milieu is underscored by its potential to animate the curricular fabric. Thus, it is essential to emphasise that collaborating to create an educational environment is made even more significant  by  its  ability  to  bring  life  and  energy  to  the  curriculum.  This animate curriculum synthesises 'knowing', 'acting' and 'being', emblematic of a richly engaging pedagogical landscape (Barnett &amp; Coate 2005; Verster et  al.  2018).  These  integral  constituents  coalesce  to  carve  a  trajectory wherein students nurture their authentic selves. The juncture of 'knowing' is characterised by a student's assertion of personal epistemological claims unique to their cognitive journey (Barnett &amp; Coate 2005) - thus, wherein students assume responsibility for their learning. This process engenders a heightened consciousness, where students synthesise experiential knowledge and appraise it critically. 'Being' underscores the transformation into  heightened  self-awareness,  where  students  articulate  cognisance through lived experiences while concurrently evaluating acquired knowledge  through  a  critical  lens.  This  confluence  ultimately  nurtures authenticity and compels students to engage earnestly, transcending the periphery of traditional educational roles (Barnett &amp; Coate 2005).

The  dialectic  interplay  of  knowing,  acting  and  becoming  a  tripartite symphony adorns the curricular landscape, infusing it with humane, personal and societal dimensions. These constituents, integral to contextual meaningmaking, germinate practicality, confidence, self-reliance, self-understanding

and  self-realisation  -  all  indispensable  constituents  for  SDL  and  selfauthorship. Nevertheless, collaboratively constructing an educational environment  that  includes  the  curriculum  is  a  complex  undertaking  with several intricate obstacles. The potency of the above-mentioned elements in teaching,  learning,  curriculum  development  and  implementation  is  insufficient to  navigate  the  complexities.  The  essence  of  student-centred  curricula necessitates nurturing students' creativity, innovation and individual relevance (Bovill &amp; Woolmer 2019; Verster et al. 2018). Therefore, co-creation assumes an inherently contingent character, intertwined with an educator's pedagogical ethos and the ensuing impact on the prospect of curricular coalescence (Bovill et al. 2016; Verster et al. 2018).

Within  the  realm  of  educational  co-creation,  these  considerations present a variety of challenges, including: (1) overcoming resistance that is ingrained in traditional educational practices; (2) navigating institutional norms that can either facilitate or obstruct collaborative efforts; and (3) establishing an inclusive co-creative ethos (Bovill et al. 2016). The cognitive paradigms and instructional methodologies of educators are the primary sources of resistance. These factors can either inspire or discourage cocreation,  depending  on  how  they  are  implemented.  This  resistance  is frequently  rooted  in  deeply  ingrained  pedagogical  norms,  experiential legacies and student expectations. As a result, it is necessary to engage in thoughtful conversation and dialogue to alleviate concerns and cultivate an atmosphere that is conducive to collaborative endeavours (Bovill et al. 2016; Hughes &amp; Barrie 2010).

Although  institutions  are  designed  with  the  best  intentions,  their architecture  and  practices  can  unwittingly  hamper  the  process  of  cocreation. The  implementation  of  collaborative partnerships that are characterised by student-driven outputs that harness their experience and understanding might, however, help to offset the potential negative effects of these problems. These types of methods not only address the structural constraints but also capitalise on the information and abilities that students already  possess,  giving  them  the  ability to actively influence their educational experiences (Bovill et al. 2016). There is the potential to change conventional  learning  settings  into  dynamic  spaces  where  co-creation thrives, which would be to the benefit of both educators and students (cf. Blignaut 2021). This might be accomplished by addressing these difficulties through strategic dialogues and institutional flexibility.

Conversely,  a  conducive  atmosphere  is  fostered  for  collaborative invention,  possibly  dismantling  the  obstacles  presented  by  entrenched perspectives  and  conventional  frameworks.  This  argument,  on  the  one hand,  emphasises  the  importance  of  acknowledging  and  questioning prevailing educational viewpoints that may impede collaboration. On the

other  hand,  the  argument  highlights  the  potential  of  SDL  and  selfauthorship  to  empower  students  and  foster  collaborative  co-creation within education.

Furthermore,  the  co-creation  imperative  is  not  an  unequivocal  canvas where every facet of teaching, learning or curricula is a subject of discussion and  transformation.  Co-creation  operates  on  a  spectrum,  aligning  with diverse individuals at varying stages, all converging towards enhancing the students'  learning  experiences  (Bovill  et  al.  2016).  Indirect  co-creation mechanisms,  like  pre-topic  brainstorming  or  preparatory  tasks,  serve  as pedagogical points of departure, reflecting students' collective yet individualised  understanding  (Bovill  et  al.  2016).  A  prudent  educator embraces  the  potency  of  power  dynamics  and  its  influence  on  learning experiences, propelling pedagogical strategies that invite co-creation (Ryan &amp;  Tilbury  2013).  Anchoring  co-creation  with  well-defined  goals,  inclusive target groups and cogent rationales for inclusion or exclusion is paramount, substantiating a purposeful and rationale-driven co-creative landscape.

Therefore, the edifice of co-creating an educational culture is a testimony to  the  dynamic interplay between educators and students, encapsulating both the inherent challenges and transformative potential. The co-created curriculum  begets  an  animate  landscape,  wherein  'knowing',  'acting'  and 'being' coalesce, nurturing authenticity, empowerment and enriched learning experiences. Notwithstanding the challenges, the manifold benefits of cocreation  radiate,  fostering  identity  development,  engagement,  motivation and  self-authorship  (Cook-Sather,  Bovill  &amp;  Felten  2014;  Lubicz-Nawrocka 2018). This co-creative tapestry - nestled within the broader schema of SDL and  meaning-making  -  serves  as  an  instrumental  conduit  for  students' journey towards self-authorship.

## Role of self-directed learning in fostering meaningful growth

Self-directed learning represents a significant paradigm shift in education, emphasising  the  empowerment  of  students  to  take  charge  of  their educational  journeys.  The  origins  of  SDL  can  be  attributed  to  the groundbreaking research conducted by scholars such as Candy, Rogers, Knowles, Guglielmino, Long and Tough, who established the foundation for this  revolutionary  educational  methodology.  At  the  heart  of  SDL  is  the cultivation of an  autonomous  classroom  environment  that  supports comfort, collaboration and partnership among students. Malcolm Knowles highlighted  this  in 1975, underlining  the  importance  of  creating  an atmosphere  where  learners  feel  emotionally,  intellectually  and  socially supported. This environment enables students to engage deeply with their learning, infusing it with personal relevance and meaning.

To effectively function as the 'architects' of their learning paths, the authors believe  that  students  must  be  provided  with  a  variety  of  supportive conditions and components. A flexible and supportive learning environment is  essential,  granting  students  the  liberty  to  customise  their  educational experiences to align with their personal interests and goals. This setting is further  enriched  by  access  to  a  diverse  array  of  resources,  including libraries, digital platforms and expert guidance, which collectively offer a wide spectrum of knowledge and tools. Moreover, the presence of skilled mentors  and  facilitators  is  crucial.  These  individuals  provide  guidance, feedback and encouragement, which are essential for nurturing SDL skills. The curriculum itself should promote choice, adaptability and real-world application, encouraging learners to apply their knowledge in meaningful ways  and  fostering  a  culture  that  values  creativity,  critical  thinking  and experimentation.

In advancing SDL, it is also vital for educators to be proactive in fostering these skills within each student. According to scholars like Du Toit-Brits (2018a), Guglielmino (2008, 2013) and Knowles et al. (2015), there is a clear mandate for educators  to  confidently  support  the  development  of  SDL skills  and  SDL  attributes  (in  Chapter  3).  Research  endorsed  by  Ancess (2003) further underscores the significance of infusing learning experiences with meaning, advocating for meaningful encounters within an SDL-based classroom setting. Thus, SDL revolutionises traditional learning methods not  only  by  fostering  autonomy  but  also  by  creating  a  transformative meaning-making  learning  environment  that  encourages  self-exploration and personal growth. This meaning-making educational approach not only prepares students to be self-reliant students but also equips them with the skills  necessary  to  navigate  and  adapt  to  the  evolving  demands  of  the modern world.

This journey towards meaningful transformation is intricately linked with the meaning-making process in SDL (Ancess 2003; Baxter Magolda &amp; King 2007; Du Toit-Brits 2018b). As Baxter Magolda and King (2007) and Du Toit-Brits (2018b) revealed, this concept  underscores  how  students construct  intentional  understandings  from  the  information  they  receive, fostering a dynamic interplay between learning and transformation. This interactive  path  of  meaning-making,  expounded  upon  by  Du  Toit-Brits (2015,  2018b),  is  pivotal  to  encouraging  students  to  derive  personal significance from the knowledge they acquire, thereby catalysing comprehensive human development (cf. King &amp; Siddiqui 2011).

In this process, nurturing personal growth and empowerment assumes a central role, intertwining seamlessly with the journey of meaning-making transformation.  Scholars  contend  that  students'  sense  of  belonging, experience and practical application of knowledge must be cultivated to

facilitate substantial behavioural, attitudinal and practical changes (Dirkx &amp; Mezirow 2006; Du Toit-Brits 2018b; Hoggan 2016; Wenger 1998; Yorks &amp; Kasl 2006). This holistic development unfolds as individuals embark on a self-directed and progressive growth voyage, even facing challenges, as illuminated by Du Toit-Brits (2018b).

Consequently, this chapter proposes that at the heart of this potentially revolutionary  process,  SDL  emerges  as  a  potent  instrument  capable  of catalysing development across intrapersonal, interpersonal and interconnected levels. Thus, equipping, guiding and supporting students through  SDL  in  the  classroom  becomes  paramount.  This  empowerment enables  students  to  uncover  their  latent  potential,  possibly  leading  to transformative  shifts  in  their  identities,  particularly  when  the  learning experiences  are  infused  with  purpose  (Dirkx  &amp;  Mezirow  2006;  Mezirow 1990; Newman 2012, 2015).

In essence, the transformation of learning prompts a shift in the student's cognitive perspective, resulting in a refined and nuanced comprehension of the learning process. Self-reflection and self-direction are integral to this change, aiding students in forging connections between new knowledge and  their  prior  experiences.  This  fusion,  therefore,  ignites  meaningful learning,  necessitating  the  cultivation  of  self-awareness  and  setting  the stage  for  an  educational  journey  that  enriches  their  lives  (Du  Toit-Brits 2018a; Henderson 2010; Taylor 2007).

The  immense  potential  of  these  meaningful  learning  experiences, capable  of  fundamentally  transforming  students'  lives,  accentuates  the importance of these ideas (Du Toit-Brits 2018b, 2022). This chapter also suggests  that  students  harness  education  as  a  conduit  by  critically evaluating  their  learning  objectives,  enhancing  their  self-concept  and redistributing the locus of control from educators to themselves. Armed with newfound skills and heightened confidence, they transition into active participants in the learning process, marked by increased accountability and self-efficacy. We believe that this deliberate educational voyage takes shape,  characterised  by  awareness,  appropriation  and  serving  as  a symbiotic catalyst for the holistic growth of each student.

## Unveiling the transformative potential of self-directed learning

As observed in the previous section, SDL is an innovative and progressive approach  to  education  that  surpasses  the  conventional  perception  of passive knowledge acquisition. We posit that SDL facilitates self-authorship development and fosters personal growth. Providing agency to students is encouraged  by  the  opportunity  to  assume  responsibility  for  their

educational trajectory (cf. Wirth et al. 2021). Regarding the idea or model put forward by Du Toit-Brits (2018b), students are urged to engage actively in their learning pursuits and build their own interpretations and knowledge. This  theoretical  framework  emphasises  the  significance  of  SDL  as  a cognitive  process  involved  in  constructing  meaning  and  has  several consequences  for  education  and  individual  growth  and  development (cf. King &amp; Siddiqui 2011).

The implementation of SDL enables students to assume a proactive role in  their  educational  journey,  fostering  a  sense  of  empowerment  and ownership. Students can thus make informed choices about their studies' content, methodology and timing. The cultivation of agency fosters selfefficacy  and  the  ability  to  actively  guide  one's  own  learning,  hence encouraging  self-reliance  and  autonomy  in  various  aspects  of  life.  To proficiently navigate the process of generating significance through SDL, students  must  engage  in  critical  thinking  and  introspection.  Students develop  skills  in  evaluating  information,  analysing  multiple  perspectives and  creating  independent  options.  These  skills  and  abilities  enhance students'  ability  to  engage  in  critical  thought,  decision-making  and problem-solving processes grounded on trustworthy information. It is also true that SDL cultivates a 'growth mindset' (e.g. as described by Dweck 2016) among students, promoting a sustained desire for knowledge and understanding that extends beyond the scope of conventional schooling. Students  who  embrace  the  SDL  concept  have  a  higher  propensity  to actively pursue novel information, effectively navigate dynamic circumstances, actively participate in continuous personal and professional growth, and are more inclined to demonstrate inventiveness.

The theoretical framework proposed by Du Toit-Brits (2018b) emphasises the  holistic  aspect  of  SDL,  which  plays  a  significant  role  in  a  student's emotional,  social  and  personal  development  (cf.  King  &amp;  Siddiqui  2011). Students acquire heightened self-awareness, develop emotional intelligence and  cultivate  resilience  throughout  their  educational  journey.  She  also believes that students must possess a heightened comprehension of their fundamental beliefs and concepts. Furthermore, in educational environments, SDL equips students with the skills and cognitive adaptability to  thrive  in  unpredictable  situations,  while  also  fostering  a  culture  of innovation that enhances their personal and professional development. It is also the opinion of Du Toit-Brits (2018b) that the field of education has undergone significant changes, resulting in a dynamic environment where students must possess adaptability and agility to traverse uncertain and fast-changing circumstances effectively. Furthermore, she holds the belief that SDL is at the forefront of this transformation, equipping students with the essential competencies and cognitive adaptations required to thrive in this ever-evolving environment.  The  ramifications of this significant

transition  are  extensive,  offering  not  just  individual  and  professional development but also a more comprehensive cultural change with creative effects on society. At the core of this paradigm shift lies the concept that traditional learning environments, characterised by disseminating information via structured and standardised media, are no longer enough in the AI world.

Therefore, this chapter proposes that students assume architects' roles in shaping their learning paths. Doing so necessitates students to develop and nurture aptitudes such as self-motivation, self-determination, critical thinking and creativity (cf. Chapter 3 for a detailed discussion on learner attributes). These endeavours include more than just academic endeavours; they are essential life skills that empower students to navigate a rapidly changing  environment,  where  what  is  considered  pertinent  now  may become outdated soon. In addition, students engaged in SDL are more likely to develop a sense of empowerment, increasing their likelihood of taking  proactive  actions  to  bring  about  positive  community  changes. Individuals  are  motivated  not  just  by  their  achievements  but  also  by  a commitment to contribute to the advancement of society.

When  students  engage  in  learning  and  assume  responsibility  and accountability for their development, they frequently encounter a feeling of intrinsic drive and enjoyment. This immersive encounter cultivates an enduring passion for intellectual pursuits and discovery, contributing to a perpetual drive for acquiring and refining information and competencies. Furthermore, to effectively  integrate  SDL  into  the  curriculum,  academic institutions  must  provide  conducive  settings  that  foster  a  self-directed environment for self-authorship. Doing so necessitates a re-evaluation of the responsibilities of educators as facilitators and mentors who provide guidance and assistance to students in their educational journeys (CookSather 2015; Du Toit-Brits 2018a). The transformative and holistic continuing SDL framework proposed by Du Toit-Brits (2018b), which influenced and informed the development of the new proposed framework depicted in Figure  2.1  -  namely, A  heutagogical  self-directed  environment  for  selfauthorship - provides insights into SDL's transforming capabilities, enabling students to become  self-authoring individuals. This new  proposed framework represents a heutagogical self-directed environment for selfauthorship and also promotes personal growth, flexibility and a lifetime dedication to acquiring knowledge by focusing on constructing meaning, cultivating critical thinking skills and creating a mentality that embraces progress.

Concerning Figure 2.1, essential inputs for developing self-authorship in the  self-directed  environment  are  illustrated  by  inward-facing  polygons around the outer edge of the diagram. The outputs (educational outcomes

and developmental changes) experienced by the student along the path to self-authorship  are  shown  by  the  unshaded  squares  in  the  centre.  The diagram hints at a broad directionality from upper left (knowing) to lower right (becoming) for the developmental path of the student (e.g. Baxter Magolda 2001; Kegan 1994) but it is by no means unidirectional.

The  concept  of a  heutagogical  self-directed  environment  for  selfauthorship ,  as  elucidated  in  Figure  2.1,  underscores  the  importance  of creating a unique and inclusive educational setting that empowers students to assume responsibility for their learning, fosters the cultivation of deep meaning  and  facilitates  the  development  of  a  sense  of  self-authorship. Educators have a crucial role in cultivating a favourable disposition towards SDL  and  fostering  the  development  of  SDL  skills.  The  desire  and preparedness of students to engage in SDL may be significantly influenced

by the enthusiasm, support, inspiration and belief in students themselves and their instructors and mentors.

Alternative  learning  approaches  (e.g.  SDL,  CL  [cooperative  learning], PBL  [problem-based  learning]) and ongoing  engagement  must  be employed  in learning environments. Introducing alternative learning methodologies may elicit initial student resistance; educators' consistent involvement is crucial in supporting and guiding students throughout this process.  Educators  face  the  challenge  of  actively  promoting  SDL  by consistently  demonstrating  their  commitment  and  enthusiasm  for  this educational strategy. In addition, it is essential to recognise each student's individuality, as learning environments should be mindful of and inclusive towards every student's unique needs and identity, prioritising their distinct capabilities and interests, with each student contributing to the educational experience.

Therefore,  educators  must  also  adopt  a  comprehensive  approach  to learning that transcends mere memorisation and underscores the significance of meaning-making. This approach promotes personal growth and transformation by motivating students to delve into more profound realms  of  knowledge  and  meaningful  connections  with  themselves  and others. Participating in educational activities that hold personal significance might enhance the growth of a more holistic self-awareness and identity in students. Educators are tasked with laying the foundation for SDL across diverse  learning  environments  and  providing  sustained  assistance.  This support facilitates the gradual transformation of students into self-directed learners by offering opportunities for intentional and meaningful teaching and learning experiences.

To build self-authorship and a safe sense of self, students must be given a learning environment that is both secure and compassionate, enabling them  to  explore  their  self-authorship.  This  process  encompasses  the establishment of a confident, secure and coherent self-identity, with the cultivation of dedication and empathy, all of which synergistically contribute to  genuine  personal  growth  and  the  exploration  of  one's  true  potential. Also, to foster the development of self-advocacy and ownership of their education, students need to shift from a passive position in the learning process to assuming an active role as authors of their learning journeys. This modification allows students to ascertain their learning prerequisites, establish goals, choose appropriate techniques, evaluate the outcomes of those strategies and engage in collaborative interactions. Self-advocacy, autonomy and self-efficacy are essential components in a transformative, holistic SDL environment.

Self-advocacy,  autonomy  and  self-efficacy  are  crucial  in  creating  a transformational  and  comprehensive  SDL  environment.  Self-advocacy

enables students to proactively seek out resources, ask for assistance and make choices that support their educational objectives, thereby increasing their autonomy in the learning process. In addition to this, autonomy offers students the liberty to investigate subjects that personally intrigue them, so enhancing their desire and involvement - essential elements for achieving successful SDL. Furthermore, self-efficacy, defined as the belief in one's ability to achieve specific goals, fosters perseverance and flexibility in the face of challenges, hence improving SDL. These factors together contribute to  the  development  of  self-authorship,  wherein  students  shape  their identities  via  their  choices  and  learning  experiences.  The  personalised learning  strategy  empowers  students  to  tailor  their  educational  paths, thereby enhancing the significance and efficacy of their learning experiences.  This  approach  leads  to  deeper,  self-directed  educational engagements. Furthermore, the cultivation of such skills not only facilitates students in navigating their educational trajectories but also significantly boosts their personal and intellectual growth.

Additionally, it is highly recommended that students use their learning experiences  in  their  educational  pursuits,  particularly  within  the  SDL environment. Because of this process of assimilation, students experience an improvement in their understanding abilities, enabling them to evaluate knowledge and generate original ideas critically. Consequently, the process of  learning  becomes  more  relevant  and  significant.  The  described  SDL environment  prioritises  the  development  of  students'  autonomy,  selfawareness and ability to engage in successful SDL. Creating a conducive learning atmosphere is crucial to developing students who possess agency, autonomy  and  self-awareness  by  integrating  positive  mindsets,  unique acknowledgements, comprehensive approaches and engaged self-creation. Such an environment would enable educators to create an SDL environment for self-authorship .

## Recommendation: A paradigm shift towards heutagogical self-directed learning environments for self-authorship

We  contend  that  fostering  self-authorship  requires  a  fundamental  reevaluation of our approach to learning. We further argue that SDL serves as an ideal vehicle for self-authorship. Thus, our perspective proposes that educators transition from an 'instructional' paradigm, where they impart knowledge to students, to a 'learning culture' paradigm. Before we propose a paradigm shift from instructional approaches to a more holistic learning culture,  it  is  crucial  to  assess  the  strengths  and  limitations  of  existing methods. Traditional instructional techniques have historically emphasised structured  curriculum  delivery,  standardised  testing  and  a  focus  on

quantifiable outcomes, which have been foundational in establishing basic educational standards and consistency across diverse educational systems. However,  the  evolution  of  the  educational  landscape,  characterised  by rapid technological advancements and changing societal needs, necessitates a shift towards a heutagogical SDL culture. By transitioning to a heutagogical SDL culture, we aim to create educational systems that are more responsive to student's needs, fostering resilience and adaptability in their professional and personal spheres. Furthermore, the authors believe that this paradigm shift will increase engagement and motivation because students  will  feel  more  connected  to  their  educational  journeys.  An emphasis on reflective practice encourages students to continuously assess their  understanding  and  the  effectiveness  of  their  learning  strategies, promoting deeper learning and greater internalisation of knowledge.

Building on the aforementioned points, the authors contend that this paradigm shift not only equips students to effectively manage their learning and professional development but also fosters a culture of lifelong learning and  adaptive  expertise.  This  approach  enables  individuals  to  apply knowledge creatively in new situations, thereby enhancing the relevance and  dynamism  of  education.  This  paradigm  change,  representing  a profound  alteration  in  strategy  or  main  assumptions,  corresponds  to current demands, where learning is increasingly recognised as a customised, ongoing and contextually driven activity. Furthermore, the learning culture, which  encompasses  the  values,  beliefs  and  practices  that  promote  and support  learning  within  an  environment,  is  enriched  through  this  shift, promoting a more holistic and transformative heutagogical self-directed educational experience.

This paradigm shift emphasises the creation of and need for dynamic learning  environments  that  would  empower  students  to  identify  their learning needs, articulate their learning goals and ideas, take responsibility for their learning progress, be able to do self-reflection on their strengths and weaknesses of their learning capabilities and environment, and be able to  adapt,  thereby  cultivating  a  robust  learning  culture.  A  significant transformation  must  occur  in  how  knowledge  is  perceived,  enabling students  to  assess  their  learning  experiences  critically.  In  line  with  this argument, we propose that achieving self-authorship within the realm of learning entails the following key aspects:

- 1. Embracing personalised learning plans and objectives designed collaboratively by oneself and others.
- 2.  Cultivating a deep understanding of oneself, one's needs and interests while striving for autonomy.
- 3.  Evolving into the author of one's learning journey and life, fostering the ability to shape beliefs, self-development and self-concept.

- 4.  Cultivating self-determination and inner motivation.
- 5.  Embracing change is an integral part of the learning process.

In advocating for a praxis of self-authorship, we propose that educators create learning environments that facilitate personal development, improved learning performance and overall well-being while nurturing selfdirection and self-authorship. By offering opportunities for SDL, intrinsic motivation  is  enhanced,  granting  students  a  sense  of  autonomy,  selfefficacy and internal commitment, thereby enabling them to construct a solid  internal  foundation  for  SDL  and  idea  generation.  Learning  environments that encourage autonomy, knowledge construction, independence, ownership and self-sufficiency facilitate the development of students into autonomous and self-determined persons, thereby fostering their progress. To  fully  embrace  the  praxis  of  self-authorship,  a  transformative  and heutagogical self-directed environment is essential. This heutagogical selfdirected environment should:

- 1. Initiate  a  profound  transformation  of  the  individual's  learning  needs, behaviour, determination and attitude, leading to a shift in their identity.
- 2.  Foster the development of a personalised learning perspective.
- 3.  Facilitate the construction of meaning from learning experiences.

To  this  end,  it  is  proposed  that  the  significance  of  a  heutagogical,  selfdirected environment needs to be increasingly recognised as pivotal for fostering self-authorship among students. This heutagogical self-directed environment  can  empower  individuals  to  take  charge  of  their  learning processes,  thus  catalysing  the  development  of  self-authorship.  In  this regard, we agree with Blaschke, Kenyon and Hase (2014), Blaschke and Marín (2020) and Hase and Blaschke (2021) that this paradigm shift from traditional  pedagogical  and  andragogical  approaches  to  a  heutagogical framework  facilitates  a  deeper  engagement  with  learning  materials, encouraging  students  to  not  only  absorb  knowledge  but  also  critically evaluate and apply it in diverse contexts. Furthermore, the self-directed nature  of  heutagogy  aligns  with  modern  educational  needs,  promoting lifelong learning and adaptability in an ever-evolving global landscape. In addition, the authors conclude that heutagogical practices do not merely enhance educational experiences but are fundamental in helping individuals become  architects  of  their  own  lives,  contributing  significantly  to  their personal development and societal involvement.

## Conclusion

In  conclusion,  this  chapter  explained  the  importance  of  using  SDL  in education  to  generate  and  foster  an  educational  setting  that  allows students  and  educators  to  build  their  identities  and  autonomously

create significance. This chapter argued that learning potential, student contributions  and  collaboration  are  essential,  as  this  paradigm  shift challenges  educators'  authority, encouraging  the  interchange  and appreciation of ideas and opinions. Moreover, this chapter showed that a fundamental step in adopting a heutagogical self-directed environment for self-authorship is to cultivate a growth mindset among contemporary students. Successful  implementation  of  a  heutagogy  self-directed environment  for  self-authorship  relies  heavily  on  both  educators  and students committing to profound change and fostering a strong desire for  personal  and  collective  growth.  This  commitment  necessitates creating a supportive learning environment that facilitates this mindset shift.  It  is critical  to  establish  conditions  that  not  only  encourage experimentation and SDL but also provide the necessary resources and support  systems  that  enable  learners  to  thrive.  Such  an  environment should be flexible and adaptable.

Consequently,  this  chapter  underscored  the  significance  of  SDL  as  a learning approach that brings about transformation. It places particular focus on fostering self-authorship and facilitating personal development. Expanding upon these fundamental principles, the next chapter (cf. Chapter 3) delves into the crucial significance of SDL attributes demonstrated by students and educators in facilitating the accomplishment of curriculum and pedagogical objectives. This seamless transition allows for an exploration of the profound influence of SDL on educational practices and outcomes.

## Abstract

Frequently,  learners 1   exhibit  a  high  level  of  engagement  with  the  learner support materials provided by their educators during classroom instruction while  displaying  a  diminished  interest  in  supplementary  endeavours  that require  independent,  critical,  creative  and  analytical  thinking.  Without learning support materials such as handouts, textbooks and information and communication technologies, learners may rely exclusively on their educators to  achieve  academic  success  and  meet  the  objectives  of  the  curriculum. Ideally, learners ought to strive to decrease their reliance on educators and exert stronger autonomy in their pursuit of knowledge, skills and experience, akin to the approach adopted by their educators. By implementing such an endeavour to be autonomous, learners exhibit increased self-directedness and  are  more  apt  to  achieve  curricular  and  pedagogical  objectives.  The authors  of  this  chapter  believe  that  increased  self-directedness  should counter  the  negative  influence  of  traditional  or  conventional  teaching strategies  that  are  'boring'  and  may  cause  diminished  performance  and interest levels. Thus, the authors further posit that implementing self-directed learning (SDL) in educational settings is necessary for attaining curriculum and  pedagogical  objectives.  Such  implementation  is  made  feasible  by facilitating higher SDL attributes among learners and educators.

In an endeavour to solve the learning barriers such as those cited in the previous paragraph, the authors were inspired by and aim to resolve this central enquiry: 'How do the self-directed learning attributes displayed by learners and educators function as catalysts in facilitating curriculum and pedagogical  goal  achievement?'  Furthermore:  'How  does  the  intricate interaction of these attributes within the educational context contribute to the potent mechanism of self-directed learning?'

In pursuit of resolutions for the research questions above, the authors of this chapter believe that to achieve higher levels of self-direction, learners must  engage  in  self-autonomy  and  that  such  engagement  is  prudent. Engaging in self-autonomy should enable learners to manifest SDL attributes such as proactivity, creativity, innovativeness and novelty. The SDL attributes mentioned earlier should contribute towards learners' lifelong experiences and  attainment  of  curriculum  goals  within  the  challenging,  dynamic, expanding  21st  century  learning  environment.  In  complement,  educators also need to manifest SDL attributes towards the same goal of attainment of curricular and pedagogical objectives. To set a compatible SDL environment, the educator must promote and enhance SDL attributes among learners and themselves to achieve curricular and pedagogical objectives.

## Introduction

In examining educational dynamics, Rashidov (2020) observes that learners show greater interest in the information presented directly by educators in classroom settings, while their engagement wanes during supplementary activities  that  demand  independent  and  analytical  thinking.  This  dependency becomes even more pronounced when learners lack access to resources like  textbooks  and  information  and  communication  technologies  (ICTs), relying heavily on their educators to meet curriculum goals. To counteract this dependency, Van Leeuwen and Janssen (2019) advocate for a reduction in educator control, encouraging learners to independently seek knowledge and skills. Echoing this sentiment, Lazorak, Belkina and Yaroslavova (2021) propose the emulation of educator behaviours as a pathway to self-directed learning (SDL).

The  urgency  for  SDL  is  amplified  in  the  fast-paced,  ever-evolving information  age.  Van  den  Berg  and  Du  Toit-Brits  (2023)  highlight  the enhancement of ICTs that continuously reshape the knowledge landscape, urging learners and educators to adopt SDL  to keep pace with advancements.  This  dynamic  era  offers  new  educational  mediums  like MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses) and diverse online tools, broadening the  scope  for  SDL  and  enabling  individuals  to  remain  current  with innovations in their fields. Hadini et al. (2020) stress that swiftly acquiring knowledge  and  adapting  to  changes  are  crucial  skills  in  today's  world. Consequently, SDL has become essential in preparing learners to contribute meaningfully to society and act as responsible citizens, as noted by Du Toit-Brits and Blignaut (2019). To further understand its significance and implementation, this chapter aims to explore how educators and learners can cultivate SDL to meet their pedagogical and curriculum objectives. It emphasises the necessity for specific attributes that facilitate the development  of  SDL  and  self-direction,  highlighting  the  pivotal  role  of active  participation  by  both  educators  and  learners  in  this  process.  The subsequent  sections  will  delve  deeper  into  the  requisite  attributes  for fostering effective SDL educational settings.

## The necessity for self-directed learning attributes in educational settings

Self-directed learning hinges on the belief that learners who take ownership of  their  educational  journeys  are  autonomous  individuals.  This  concept, outlined by pioneers like Guglielmino (2013) and Knowles (1975), emphasises the  responsibility  that  learners  assume  for  their  learning  paths,  actively seeking  self-improvement  and  advancement  opportunities.  In  a  world characterised  by  rapid  transformations  and  emerging  challenges,  the

significance of SDL has become increasingly pronounced. Educators and learners alike are compelled to continuously adapt to new circumstances and prospects, underscoring the escalating relevance of SDL.

In  SDL  environments,  learners  are  empowered  with  the  autonomy  to direct  their  educational  activities,  whether  synchronously  or  asynchronously, as noted by Loeng (2020). This freedom supports the cultivation of skills that go  beyond  traditional knowledge  acquisition, encouraging  the development  of  cognitive,  metacognitive,  motivational  and  affective attributes. These attributes are essential as they equip learners with the skills  needed  to  successfully  guide  their  educational  paths.  Therefore, recognising  the  importance  of  these  attributes  is  crucial.  They  not  only enable  learners  to  guide  their  learning  independently  but  also  allow educators to tailor their learning and teaching strategies to thrive in such adaptive learning environments. The subsequent sections will delve deeper into the critical nature of these SDL attributes, exploring their necessity and influence in fostering a conducive learning atmosphere.

## Attributes of a self-directed learner

Lemmetty and Collins (2020) identify six critical attributes of a self-directed learner, emphasising their ability to autonomously choose the timing, scope and sequencing of their work. These learners take responsibility for their educational activities, and recognise and address their own learning needs (Vahedi, Zannella &amp; Want 2019). They also set personal objectives, utilise additional resources such as ICTs and clearly define their learning outcomes to foster intrinsic motivation and conscientious engagement in educational tasks.

Furthermore, several specific attributes of self-directed learners include a keen awareness of current tasks (Toh &amp; Kirschner 2020), adeptness in selecting  effective  learning  strategies  and  activities  (Rashid  &amp;  Asghar 2016), competence in evaluating both resources and personal performance and  proficient  use  of  interpersonal  skills  (Vahedi  et  al.  2019).  These attributes highlight the learner's capacity to understand essential factors in the  learning  process,  employ  strategic  methods,  engage  critically  with material and develop interpersonal capabilities.

Table 3.1 consolidates these attributes based on an extensive analysis of existing research. This arrangement aids in understanding the attributes' implementation without suggesting a strict sequence for their application in SDL  contexts.  It shows  that  self-directed learners manage  their educational paths, choosing suitable learning environments and methods, whether  online  or  face-to-face  and  strategically  designing  activities  to meet educational goals while applying creativity and originality.

The role of educators in fostering self-directedness involves providing support and guidance without relinquishing their responsibilities (Lemmetty &amp;  Collins  2020).  It  is  essential  to  maintain  a  balance  between  learner autonomy and adequate educational support, as highlighted by Tuzlukova and Singh (2019) and further supported by Baru, Tenggara and Mataram (2020), Du Toit-Brits (2018a) and Grow (as cited in Tredoux 2012). These viewpoints emphasise that the extent of educator involvement should be adjusted  according  to  the  learner's  level  of  self-direction  and  stage  of development. The subsequent sections will explore the progression levels through which learners evolve towards complete self-directedness.

## Progression levels of learner self-directedness

According  to  Tredoux  (2012),  Grow's  model  suggests  that  SDL  is  a process that involves multiple stages or levels, during which the learner advances from a state of complete dependence to gradually developing interest, becoming engaged and ultimately achieving maturity in selfdirectedness.  The  progression  from  dependence  to  self-directedness

occurs under the supervision and guidance of the educator. In a later section dealing with attributes of an SDL educator, the authors expound more on the said guidance. Within that section, the authors outline the educators' duties in facilitating the learners' advancement towards selfdirectedness.  While  undertaking  the  SDL  process,  the  individuals (learner or educator) fulfil their duties within the confines of their SDL attributes. As discussed in this section, several attributes within SDL are demonstrated in Table 3.2.

Table 3.2 describes actions taken to achieve specific learner attributes, which can be used as input measures for impact analysis. The acquisition of learner or educator attributes is associated with producing measurable outcomes. The process of inputting information or data into a system leads to the production of either a primary or secondary result. Every outcome confers advantages to the learner, the educator or both parties involved. Furthermore,  Table  3.2  suggests  that  educators'  commitment  to  SDL principles (input) is likely to lead to the cultivation of self-directed learners (primary output). They will generate a dependable resource or assessment of ICT using the same input. The authors of this chapter are of the opinion that  when  a  learner  achieves  emancipation,  it  leads  to  a  confident  and proficient individual who actively engages in SDL. The primary output of a given input is a learner who exercises autonomy in selecting their preferred time, sequence, goal or order.

Moreover, as illustrated in Table 3.2, the self-directed learner operates within their designated SDL attributes throughout the SDL process. This systematic  approach  generates  a  range  of  inputs  and  outputs  that  can

Key: SDL, self-directed learning.

benefit the learner and their educator significantly. Self-directed learners play a pivotal role in achieving curriculum and pedagogical objectives, as they need to exhibit self-motivation, active engagement and a sense of accountability and ownership towards their learning. Furthermore, learners and educators who embrace SDL tend to experience improved retention of information, enhanced problem-solving capabilities and the acquisition of lifelong learning skills.

## Implementation of self-directed learning strategies to accomplish curriculum and pedagogical goals

Self-directed  learning  strategies  represent  a  transformative  approach  in education,  moving  away  from  traditional  teacher-centred  methods  to learner-driven experiences that foster autonomy, motivation and metacognition.  Implementation  of  SDL  within  educational  frameworks requires meticulous preparation, robust support systems and integration with technological advancements to achieve curriculum and pedagogical goals.

The efficacy of SDL is grounded in its ability to empower learners to actively  determine  their  learning  needs,  set  personal  objectives,  select appropriate  materials  and  assess  their  progress.  This  process  not  only enhances the learning experience but also contributes to more meaningful and sustainable educational outcomes (Loeng 2020; Mok &amp; Mo 2018). By fostering  attributes  such  as  learner  independence  and  motivation  (see Table 3.1), SDL aligns well with contemporary educational paradigms that emphasise lifelong learning and adaptability (Tan et al. 2017).

However,  the  successful  adoption  of  SDL  is  not  without  challenges. Traditional educational settings, typically characterised by fixed curricula and instructor-led delivery, can pose significant barriers to the integration of SDL  strategies  (Ginzburg,  Santen  &amp;  Schwartzstein  2020).  These environments often lack the flexibility necessary to accommodate individual learning paths and may hinder the cultivation of essential metacognitive abilities crucial for successful SDL (Karatas &amp; Arpaci 2021).

To  counter  these  challenges,  educators  must  adopt  a  dual  role  as facilitators and supporters of learning. This involves creating a setting that enables  learners  to  take  charge  of  their  educational  paths,  fostering  a feeling  of  responsibility  and  commitment  towards  their  learning  goals (Brockett &amp; Hiemstra 2018; Guglielmino 2013). Providing scaffolded support is crucial in helping learners develop the competencies needed to navigate their learning processes effectively. This support can take various forms,

including strategic guidance, resource provision and emotional backing, all aimed  at  enhancing  the  learner's  ability  to  manage  their  educational activities autonomously and with accountability (Du Toit-Brits &amp; Van Zyl 2017).

Furthermore, the incorporation of ICT resources is crucial in enhancing the facilitation of SDL (Van den Berg &amp; Du Toit-Brits 2023). Technological tools  can  provide  diverse  learning  materials,  enable  flexible  learning schedules and support the personalisation of learning experiences (Sumuer 2018).  By  leveraging  ICT,  educators  can  offer  a  more  adaptive  and responsive  learning  environment  that  caters  to  the  unique  needs  and preferences of each learner. Moreover, these technologies can facilitate the integration  of  the  organised  requirements  of  the  curriculum  with  the adaptable nature of SDL, hence augmenting both learner engagement and academic success (Vahedi et al. 2019; Van den Berg &amp; Du Toit-Brits 2023).

Social interactions also significantly impact the successful implementation of SDL. Collaborative learning environments, whether formal or informal, encourage  the  sharing  of  ideas,  peer-to-peer  support  and  collective problem-solving, which are vital components and strategies of SDL. Social involvement facilitates the development of a more profound comprehension of one's learning processes as well as those of others, hence enhancing the overall  learning  experience  (Belcher  &amp;  Palenberg  2018;  Roumell  2016). Educators need to foster a community that supports these interactions, promoting a culture of mutual respect, shared responsibility and accountability.

In  addition  to  providing  ICT  and  social  support,  educators  must  also focus  on  developing  the  intrinsic  motivation  of  learners.  Self-directed learning is heavily reliant on the learner's internal drive and interest in their learning process (Du Toit-Brits 2022). Motivation is both a prerequisite for and  an  outcome  of  successful  SDL.  Educators  can  enhance  learner motivation  by  ensuring  that  learning  activities  are  relevant,  challenging and aligned with individual goals and interests (Du Toit-Brits 2022).

To  ensure  that  SDL  strategies  are  effectively  implemented  to  meet curricular and pedagogical objectives, educational institutions and policymakers  must  invest  in  training  educators  in  SDL  principles  and strategies. This includes not only the theoretical aspects but also practical skills in managing diverse learning environments; implementing problembased  learning,  collaborative  learning,  critical  thinking  and  problemsolving, adaptive learning strategies, self-monitoring and reflection, time management;  employing  ICT  tools  effectively;  and  facilitating  social learning  dynamics.  Such  preparation  ensures  that  educators  are  wellequipped  to  guide  and  support  learners  through  their  self-directed educational pathways (Van den Berg &amp; Du Toit-Brits 2023).

Finally, the establishment of clear learning objectives and the use of selfassessment techniques are critical in the SDL process. These elements help learners  monitor  their  progress  and  adjust  their  learning  strategies, accordingly, ensuring that they remain aligned with both their aspirations and the educational standards required by their educational institutions (Siminica &amp; Dumitru 2013). Therefore, while SDL offers numerous benefits in terms of learner engagement and educational effectiveness, its successful implementation  requires  a  comprehensive  and  nuanced  approach.  By addressing the challenges of traditional educational settings, adequately preparing  and  supporting  educators,  integrating  suitable  technologies, facilitating social interactions and nurturing learner motivation, educational institutions can harness the full potential of SDL to meet their curricular and pedagogical goals.

## Fostering collaborative partnerships between learners and educators in selfdirected learning

The fostering of collaborative partnerships between learners and educators in SDL environments represents a pivotal transformation from traditional teacher-led paradigms to learner-centric education. This shift emphasises the importance of reciprocal, socially engaged interactions that aim to not only meet curricular and pedagogical goals but also enhance the educational experience by promoting autonomy, mutual respect and shared responsibilities.  Research  in  the  field  of  education  has  underscored  the considerable  advantages  that  emerge  when  learners  and  educators collaborate as partners in the educational experience. As noted by Blignaut and  Du  Toit-Brits  (2023),  the  collaborative  nature  of  SDL  establishes  a nurturing and supportive environment that deviates from the conventional, hierarchical teacher-student dynamic. Instead, it encourages a cooperative relationship  aimed  at  achieving  common  educational  objectives.  This  is supported by Tan et al. (2017), who emphasise that such partnerships are grounded in mutual respect and trust, critical elements for a functional and effective educational relationship.

Educators  in  SDL  contexts  assume  a  facilitative  role,  wherein  their primary  responsibility  shifts  from  delivering  content  to  creating  a conducive learning environment. This approach is designed to cater to the  individual  needs  of  the  learner,  allowing  for  a  personalised  and meaningful educational journey. However, this approach presents challenges, particularly when addressing the varied levels of motivation, skills and knowledge among learners as SDL demands considerable selfmotivation and self-regulation from learners, traits that are not uniformly present across all individuals.

To counteract these challenges, educators must skilfully balance granting learners  autonomy  and  independence  with  ensuring  the  attainment  of specific learning outcomes. This balancing act requires a nuanced approach, sometimes necessitating additional organisation and directional support to ensure that learners remain on track to fulfil their educational objectives (Lodders  &amp;  Meijers  2017;  Momennejad  2022).  The  adaptability  of  this approach  is  crucial,  allowing  for  a  flexible  yet  structured  environment where both educators and learners collaborate closely to ensure that the educational goals are met effectively and meaningfully.

Broadening  the  scope  to  consider  the  social  implications  of  SDL, research also indicates that the collaborative partnerships fostered in SDL contexts extend beyond individual achievement to encompass significant social value (Du Toit-Brits 2020; Dziuban et al. 2018; Garrison 1997; Valiathan 2002). The social engagement inherent in these partnerships is critical in enhancing the social dimensions of education, empowering both learners and  educators  as  active  participants  in  the  educational  process.  This empowerment  is  facilitated  through  the  creation  of  an  open,  inclusive atmosphere that values diverse perspectives and promotes active participation,  mutual  respect  and  shared  decision-making  (Breed  2016; Kemp, Baxa &amp; Cortes 2022).

In  this  collaborative  partnership,  the  co-creation  of  knowledge  occurs through a dynamic exchange of ideas and active engagement, which fosters a deep sense of ownership and commitment to the learning process. This not only equips learners with critical cognitive skills such as critical thinking, problem-solving  and  effective  communication  but  also  instils  a  sense  of motivation, belonging and capability to pursue and achieve their objectives (Du Toit-Brits 2022). Educators, in this partnership, function as mentors and facilitators, tailoring their support to meet the unique needs of each learner while also deriving valuable insights into the learners' interests and learning styles.  This  understanding  enables  educators  to  design  and  deliver  a curriculum that is both effective and resonant with the learners' needs.

The collaborative partnerships also provide a platform for educators to observe  the  direct  influence  of  their  guidance  on  learners'  progress  and achievement, which can lead to greater professional satisfaction and growth (Kim &amp; Yang 2020). The reciprocal nature of this relationship not only meets educational  and  curricular  goals  and  objectives  but  also  transforms  the educational environment into a dynamic, evolving space where learning is a mutually  enriching  and  self-directed  experience.  Also,  the  integration  of innovation and creativity within SDL, as suggested by Kalyani and Rajasekaran (2018), underscores  the  flexibility and  adaptability  required  in these partnerships.  Educators  are  encouraged  to  embrace  their  originality  and inventiveness, thereby enhancing their teaching methodologies and interactions with learners. This freedom to innovate within SDL is crucial for

fostering  environments  where  learners  can  take  initiative,  whether  in synchronous  or  asynchronous  settings,  to  explore  their  creativity  and establish  personalised  learning  trajectories  under  the  guidance  of  their educators (Kaushik &amp; Walsh 2019; Lombard 2018; Vahedi et al. 2019).

Thus,  the  authors  believe  that  the  collaboration  between  learners  and educators  in  SDL  settings  is  not  merely  a  means  to  achieve  educational outcomes but a transformative process that cultivates individuality, creativity and  a  deep,  mutually  beneficial  partnership.  This  partnership  not  only achieves curricular and pedagogical success but also enriches the educational landscape by introducing elements of social engagement, personal relevance and continuous innovation. Therefore, understanding the role and significance of being a self-directed educator in this collaborative partnership within this dynamic learning environment becomes essential.

## The significance of being a self-directed educator in educational settings

As stated earlier, the traditional approach to disseminating knowledge and acquiring  competencies  is  insufficient in today's fast-paced  society. Developing  SDL  attributes  is  crucial  for  learners  as  it  involves  taking responsibility for their academic endeavours and actively seeking additional resources to enhance their understanding of diverse subjects. It therefore is imperative for educators to embrace a proactive stance in fostering SDL and its relevant attributes and to implement a pedagogical approach that empowers  learners  (Du  Toit-Brits  2018a;  Robinson  &amp;  Persky  2020). Cultivating SDL attributes among learners can enhance their capacity to adapt  to  changing  situations  and  to  take  advantage  of  developing opportunities  throughout  their  lifespans  (Du  Toit-Brits  &amp;  Blignaut  2019; Nasri 2019). The achievement of this goal relies on the crucial role of an autonomous and self-directed educator.

As expressed above, an educator's role in the SDL process is paramount, as  they  bear  multiple  obligations  in  enabling  SDL  (Nasri  2019).  The aforementioned  refers  to  the  establishment  of  a  safe  and  welcoming environment that promotes a feeling of comfort among learners, motivating them to ask questions, express their opinions and engage in bold initiatives (Du Toit-Brits  2018a;  Nasri  2019).  Furthermore,  within  the  SDL  context, educators  offer  learners  instructional  support  and  evaluative  input  at different  junctures  along  the  learning  journey.  The  process  of  guidance and  feedback  is  integral  to  assisting  learners  in  establishing  attainable objectives, furnishing them with appropriate resources and materials and evaluating  their  advancement  through  feedback  (Nasri  2019).  Another role of the self-directed educator is to foster introspection, as this act of reflecting  holds  significant  value  in  the  context  of  SDL  (Nasri  2019).

Self-directed  learning  educators  should  motivate  learners  to  engage  in reflective  thinking  regarding  their  educational  experiences  and  discern their  acquired  knowledge  and  areas  that  require  further  development (Nasri 2019).

Furthermore,  in  alignment  with  the  perspective  of  Du  Toit-Brits  and Blignaut (2019), we affirm the significance of fostering SDL attributes as a vital  component  of  education  (Nasri  2019),  and  as  seen  earlier,  it  is  the responsibility of educators to actively facilitate the cultivation and enhancement of these attributes within learners. Hence, the significance of a self-directed educator within education and knowledge acquisition cannot be underestimated (Du Toit-Brits 2018a). Based on Du Toit-Brits (2018a), a self-directed educator should possess specific attributes that contribute to establishing a conducive learning environment, enabling learners to assume ownership of their academic pursuits. The educator's action of establishing a  conducive  learning  environment,  in  turn,  promotes  the  self-directed learners' autonomy, resourcefulness and overall achievement. By embracing a  self-directed  approach,  educators  can  equip  learners  with  the  essential attributes necessary for success in the contemporary era (Du Toit-Brits &amp; Blignaut 2019; Nasri 2019). To synthesise the topics mentioned earlier, the following section elucidates the attributes of a self-directed educator.

## Attributes of an educator in self-directed learning

The  capacity  to  act  as  an  independent  self-directed  educator  holds significant  value  in  fostering  the  growth  of  learners'  abilities  and  skills essential  for  their  self-sufficiency  (Porter  &amp;  Freeman  2020).  Porter  and Freeman (2020) maintain that educators who take the initiative in directing their  learning  and  teaching  can  effectively  cultivate  their  professional development by continuously improving their skills and expanding their knowledge. To thrive in an SDL setting and context, a self-directed educator must possess essential attributes. As the authors of this chapter, we aim to highlight the salient attributes of self-directed educators:

- 1. Educators  must  have  adequate  facilitation  skills. This is of utmost importance. Instead of trying to control or coerce their learners through the educational process, educators should be able to offer direction and advice to their learners. The responsibility of cultivating a supportive and self-directed environment that supports learner autonomy and encourages accountability for academic success falls on the shoulders of educators.
- 2.  Educators  need  to  be  able  to  adapt  and  wish  to  engage  in  new experiences.  It  is  necessary  to  display  adaptability  and  openness  to accommodate each learner's unique requirements and preferences. In addition, teachers need to be able to adapt the lesson's pace and the

instructional methods they use to cater to their learners' individualised educational requirements.

- 3.  Educators should demonstrate empathy for their learners by acknowledging and understanding the diverse backgrounds, life experiences  and  individual  preferences  regarding  the  instructional approaches they find most engaging.
- 4.  The ability to communicate effectively is a criterion that must be met to work  in  the  field  of  education.  They  should  actively  listen,  provide constructive  feedback  and  motivate  learners  to  express  their  perspectives and concepts.
- 5.  Familiarity with pedagogical theories is essential to an educator's skill set. This knowledge empowers educators to effectively implement these theories  in  practical  instructional  situations,  thereby  facilitating  the creation of impactful learning activities and assessments.
- 6.  Educators must demonstrate an unwavering commitment to continuous learning and professional development. They should be willing to explore innovative concepts and techniques and be open to experimenting with various pedagogical approaches and methodologies.
- 7. Educators should have a genuine passion for teaching and be driven by the progress and development of their learners. This dedication will help learners maintain engagement and enthusiasm, even in challenging circumstances.

As seen above, self-directed  educators  must  be  accountable,  assume responsibility  and  take  ownership  of  their  teaching  in  their  learning environments. Educators should also stay abreast of current research and educational trends through self-directedness, adjust their instructional strategies to meet evolving learners' needs and consistently enhance their pedagogical practices. Such instructional strategies have the  potential  to  result  in  improved  academic  achievements  among learners. The authors use Table 3.3 to enumerate statements describing the attributes of an educator in SDL environments based on numerous sources to further elaborate on the importance of the educator's selfdirectedness.

As illustrated in Table 3.3, the attributes deemed critical for self-directed educators include the ability to engage in self-reflection, possess a curious disposition,  be  adaptable,  demonstrate  self-motivation  and  exhibit  a collaborative approach, to mention only a few. Therefore, educators with SDL  attributes  must  facilitate  and  promote  learners'  self-directedness. Educators also need to act as self-directed agents and demonstrate the significance of assuming responsibility for one's teaching journey by being self-directed  learners  themselves.  Educators  who  exhibit  SDL  attributes are  more  prone  to  possess  an  in-depth  comprehension  of  the  learning process, enabling them to furnish their learners with guidance and resources

that  foster  the  development  of  SDL  attributes.  These  educators  can cultivate an environment that promotes curiosity, analytical reasoning and SDL  in  the  classroom  and  facilitate  the  acquisition  of  fundamental competencies such as problem-solving, judgement and continuous learning among  learners. In addition, educators who  adopt SDL  attributes persistently  pursue  professional  development  and  remain  abreast  of current pedagogical strategies and approaches, ultimately enhancing their learners' academic  experiences,  thus  fostering  self-directedness  and attaining curriculum and pedagogical objectives.

## Fostering learner self-directedness: The crucial role of educator autonomy and guidance

In  contemporary  educational  paradigms,  fostering  self-directedness  in learners  has  gained  prominence  as  a  critical  objective.  Central  to  this endeavour is the crucial role of self-directed educators, whose influence

extends  beyond  conventional  teaching  methods.  The  preceding  section underscores  the  significance  of  educators  embracing  SDL  by  acquiring diverse  skills  and  attributes  to  empower  learners  in  making  informed decisions about their educational environment. Such decisions encompass evaluating the merits of traditional classroom-based instruction, commonly called  the  'brick-and-mortar'  setting,  and  exploring  alternative  learning platforms,  including  online  modalities  (Horn  &amp;  Stalker  2017).  A  pivotal attribute of self-directed educators  involves  autonomy  and  intrinsic motivation (Du Toit-Brits 2018a).

In line with Azeez et al. (2019), intrinsic motivation denotes the inclination to invest one's energy in a particular task because of the inherent pleasure derived from that task. Hence, a crucial attribute of self-directed educators lies in their intrinsic motivation to enhance the efficacy of their teaching, thereby fostering SDL skills among their learners. This notion finds support in the works of Du Toit-Brits (2018a) and Louws, Meirink, Van Veen and Van Driel (2017) and proves essential in achieving curriculum and pedagogical objectives. As mentioned earlier, intrinsically motivated educators assume diverse roles based on the learner's degree of independence, aiming to promote and nurture the learner's autonomy and self-directedness. The following section explores self-directed educators' strategies to navigate various roles and levels of SDL, facilitating their self-directed progress.

## Nurturing self-directed learning: The multifaceted role of educators as coaches, motivators, facilitators and consultants

In this chapter, we contend that education is not solely about imparting knowledge but equipping learners and educators with the skills, values, attitudes and mindset to navigate their educational journeys proactively. At the heart of this transformative approach (see Chapter 2) lies the figure of the  self-directed  educator,  whose  role  transcends  the  traditional boundaries of teaching. The educator's position in the SDL process is of utmost  importance  and  undergoes  many  transformations  throughout distinct stages. These stages encompass the educator's roles as a coach, motivator,  facilitator  and  consultant,  which  are  contingent  upon  the learner's readiness to actively engage in SDL (Du Toit-Brits 2020). These positions exemplify a continuum towards cultivating SDL among learners, to attain curriculum and pedagogical goals. Educators assume a pivotal position in the attainment of curriculum and pedagogical objectives that prioritise  the  cultivation  of  critical  thinking,  the  cultivation  of  lifelong learning  skills  and  the  ability  to  adapt  to  an  ever-evolving  information landscape. It is important for educators engaged in SDL to recognise that their level of self-directedness depends on their skills, attributes, abilities

and intellectual understanding, all while effectively fulfilling the aforementioned tasks (Abid, Hussain &amp; Shoaib 2019).

Consequently,  the  educator  responsible  for  implementing  SDL  must possess the attributes (see Table 3.3) and necessary skills to assess the learners'  preparedness  and  willingness  for  SDL  (Mok  &amp;  Mo  2018).  As mentioned earlier, this assessment enables the educator to determine the most  appropriate  approach  for  guiding  the  learner  through  the  various stages towards attaining self-directedness. As highlighted in the previous section regarding the progression of the learner's SDL levels, there needs to be a systematic correlation between the learner's SDL levels and the corresponding roles of the educator. In the initial stages, when the learner relies on the educator, the educator assumes the coach role. As the learner advances in their learning journey and becomes a more proactive stance in the  process  of  acquiring  knowledge,  the  instructor  assumes  the  responsibility of serving as a source of motivation. As learners take a more active role in their  learning  process,  the  educator's  role  shifts  to  that  of  a  facilitator. Ultimately, as learners achieve self-direction, educators adopt the role of a consultant.  Notably,  through  the  SDL  stages,  the  educator's  authority gradually diminishes, and their involvement remains at the periphery.

Kwan (2003, cited in Tredoux 2012) categorised the roles of educators, encompassing the labels of expositor or coach, guided motivator, facilitator and consultant. Kwan also outlines the progression of the learner's selfdirectedness through four stages, denoted as 'Stages 1 to 4'. These stages represent the learner's transition from a state of passivity and dependency to one of interest and motivation, involvement and commitment, and finally, self-directedness and initiation. Notably, delineating these stages emphasises that SDL does not absolve educators of their responsibilities (Lemmetty &amp; Collins 2020). Learners still require guidance and support from instructors to enhance their learning experiences, including implementing  effective  learning  techniques  (Palmer  et  al.  2019)  and establishing an informal SDL atmosphere (Song &amp; Bonk 2016).

The level of learner receptiveness to the involvement of educators in the SDL environment highlights that, despite intrinsic motivation and openness, learners benefit from extrinsic motivation influenced by external processes and social and behavioural factors (Azeez et al. 2019; Crippen et al. 2009; Joo  et  al.  cited  by  Zhu,  Bonk  &amp;  Doo  2020),  collaborative  partnerships, leadership, guidance and support. Brockett and Hiemstra's research (2018, p. 78) suggests that learners may lack confidence and comprehension of the  ICT  resources  necessary  to  achieve  curriculum  objectives  without adequate support from educators. As a result, it can be argued that in SDL settings,  learners  require  the  guidance  and  assistance  of  educators  to attain their academic objectives successfully and progress to higher levels of self-directedness.

Based on the previous discussion, it is evident that educators who can guide learners through learning and instruction are crucial in achieving the goals of curriculum and pedagogy in contemporary educational systems. In  the context of the changing educational environment, educators who possess qualities such as flexibility, adaptability and a steadfast commitment to SDL and lifelong learning play an essential role in encouraging the selfdirectedness of learners. Educators' independent practice towards enhancing their professional growth and ability to think creatively enables them  to  devise  and  execute  tactics  that  foster  SDL  among  learners proficiently. To conclude, educators' vast responsibilities, including coaching, motivating, facilitating and consulting, enhance their ability to address  learners'  varied  learning  requirements  and  preferences.  These multifaceted  roles  are  crucial  in  fostering  an  environment  conducive  to SDL, thereby promoting SDL among learners and educators.

In the following section, the authors of this chapter provide recommendations for educational institutions, educators and learners. These recommendations aim to enhance and effectively implement SDL attributes among educators and learners.  The  ultimate  objective  is  to  facilitate  the achievement of curricular and pedagogical goals within SDL environments.

## Recommendations and implications for educator training

This chapter suggests that to enhance the SDL attributes of both learners and  educators  to  achieve  curricular  and  pedagogical  objectives,  the following recommendations can be put into practice:

## Emphasising personalised learning pathways

To fully harness the potential of SDL attributes in both learners and educators, it is imperative to create personalised learning pathways. These pathways should  be  designed  to  adapt  dynamically  to  the  individual's  strengths, weaknesses and interests. For instance, curriculum designers could integrate adaptive  learning  technologies  that  analyse  learner  performance  and preferences  to  tailor  educational  content  accordingly.  Also,  educators should be trained to develop flexible pedagogical strategies that can be adjusted in real time based on learner feedback and learning analytics.

## Strengthening educator's role as facilitators

Transitioning the role of educators from traditional content deliverers to facilitators  of  learning  can  significantly  boost  SDL.  Professional  development programmes should focus on equipping educators with the skills to guide

enquiry, foster critical thinking and encourage exploration. This includes training  on  asking  provocative  questions  and  managing  project-based learning.  Additionally,  educational  policies  should  support  educators  in taking  risks  and  innovating  their  teaching  methods  to  promote  a  more learner-centred environment.

## Cultivating a culture of continuous feedback

Continuous feedback is important in an SDL environment. This approach can  provide  both  educators  and  learners  with  the  insights  needed  to improve their methods and strategies. This can be done by implementing regular peer reviews where both learners and educators share feedback on learning experiences, which can foster a supportive community focused on continuous improvement. Also, the use of digital tools needs to be promoted to facilitate real-time feedback and reflection, allowing learners to adjust their learning paths and educators to modify their instructional strategies promptly.

## Leveraging digital platforms for collaborative learning

Digital platforms can serve as catalysts for both developing and showcasing SDL attributes, namely, online forums, and collaborative tools can be used to encourage learners to engage with peers, discuss learning materials and develop  critical  thinking  skills  outside  the  traditional  classroom  setting. Educators can also utilise these platforms to share resources, strategies and  pedagogical  innovations  with  colleagues,  promoting  a  culture  of collaboration and lifelong learning.

## Encouraging metacognitive skills development

Developing metacognitive skills is essential for effective SDL as it enables learners to understand their learning processes and preferences. This can be done through the integration of metacognitive activities such as learning journals,  planning  and  reflection  sessions,  and  self-assessment  exercises into the curriculum. However, educator training also needs to focus more on metacognitive teaching strategies that can help educators guide their learners in becoming aware of their learning tactics and strategies, thus enhancing their learning autonomy.

These recommendations aim to cultivate learning environments where SDL attributes in both learners and educators are recognised as pivotal mechanisms for achieving curriculum and pedagogical objectives.

## Conclusion

To this end, it is proposed that the transformative power of SDL must be recognised in achieving educational goals. This exploration underscores SDL not merely as a desirable skill but as an essential catalyst in modern education paradigms.  Learners,  equipped  with  SDL  attributes,  exhibit  a  remarkable ability to adapt to evolving educational landscapes, demonstrating resilience, initiative and a continuous passion for their learning. Educators, on their part, transition from traditional gatekeepers of knowledge to facilitators and colearners,  adapting  teaching  strategies  that  foster  learner  autonomy  and critical thinking.

The synergy between learner and educator attributes in SDL creates a dynamic learning environment where curriculum goals are not only met but also exceeded. This environment encourages innovation, critical enquiry and the practical application of knowledge, aligning closely with contemporary  pedagogical  objectives  that  prioritise  adaptability  and proactive  learning.  Furthermore,  the  incorporation  of  SDL  within  the curriculum is not without its challenges, including the need for substantial support structures and a shift in traditional teaching mindsets. Ultimately, by  fostering  SDL  attributes  among  both  learners  and  educators,  a foundation  for  achieving  curriculum  and  pedagogical  objectives  is  laid where learners are prepared not merely for exams but for lifelong success and adaptability in an ever-changing world, marking a significant stride towards educational excellence.

## Abstract

This chapter 2  focused on insights into how teacher training can be improved to better prepare novice teachers for the complexities of modern education and the integration of self-directed learning (SDL) strategies. This chapter emphasised the significance of equipping novice teachers with the necessary competencies  and  methodologies  to  facilitate  SDL  among  their  learners.

2. In the chapter title, 'Bridging the gap: Nurturing self-directedness in higher education teacher training and teachers' job demands', we refer to job demands (workload) instead of training, because literature refers to job demands as workload.

Self-directed  learning  is  an  essential  element  of  education  that  empowers learners  and  teachers  to  take  charge  of  their  learning  and  teaching  and develop  proficiencies  in  critical  thinking,  problem-solving  and  continuous learning. Integrating SDL into the academic syllabus and providing sufficient assistance for novice teachers to execute it competently can enhance learner involvement  and  incentive  and  cultivate  an  atmosphere  of  independent learning and self-motivated enterprise. Consequently, this can lead to more substantial educational encounters and enhanced scholastic accomplishments.

## Introduction

The  previous  chapter  explored  the  attributes  of  self-directed  learning (SDL) among learners and educators in general education settings. This chapter is linked to Chapter 3, emphasising SDL's role in education. The rapidly  evolving  and  complex 21st-century landscape, particularly within the  Fourth  Industrial  Revolution  (4IR)  context,  makes  disseminating knowledge within educational institutions pivotal. Novice teachers often confront  unforeseen  challenges,  anticipating  their  university-acquired knowledge  will  be  sufficient  (Louws  et  al.  2017;  Oppenheimer  2017; Richards &amp; Farrell 2016; Tican &amp; Deniz 2019). Higher education institutions (HEIs) must reform pedagogical paradigms to integrate SDL principles into teaching methodologies (Boser 2017; Fashant et al. 2020; Haiyan, Walker &amp; Xiaowei 2017; Harrington 2018; Van Wyk 2017).

Barbousas (2023) highlights the need for novice teachers to develop, adapt and synthesise information into comprehensible knowledge; adapt teaching methodologies to diverse contexts; and engage creatively with peers and stakeholders (Kayembe &amp; Nel 2019). Despite their enthusiasm, novice  teachers  face  challenges  hindering  their  integration  into  today's transformative education landscape  (Darling-Hammond  2023).  Many teacher training programmes do not address the specific requirements of novice  teachers  in  underperforming  schools  (Rice  2023).  However,  by fostering a collaborative environment, where researchers and policymakers work together, we can develop rigorous, context-specific training programmes for teachers in demanding environments (Rice 2023).

Novice teachers need ongoing professional development and mentorship to  cope  with  teaching  challenges,  as  limited  knowledge  can  lead  to frustration and inefficacy (Ayoobiyan &amp; Rashidi 2021). Inadequate teaching abilities  and  lack  of  consistent  feedback  can  result  in  decreased  job motivation and  negative attitudes towards the profession. Support structures play a crucial role in mitigating stress and preventing burnout (Bakker &amp; De Vries 2021). Furthermore, it is imperative for novice teachers to  understand  curriculum  development  to  create  effective  lessons  and ensure  alignment  with  educational  goals  (Ke  Lomi  &amp;  Mbato  2020).

Establishing  a  meaningful  connection  between  knowledge  and  learners' needs necessitates well-designed curricula and resources.

Darling-Hammond (2023) highlights the importance of ongoing learning and continuous professional development for novice and experienced teachers to address diverse and unpredictable learning requirements. Training programmes should cultivate a mindset encouraging persistence in solving complex challenges and learning from experiences and peers. Self-directed learning and continuous professional development principles are essential for all  teachers,  including  those  experienced  but  lacking  formal  SDL  training. Addressing technology-oriented pedagogy challenges is crucial, particularly in South African educational contexts, where resource inadequacies hinder technology integration (Du Plessis &amp; Mestry 2019). Tertiary institutions should prioritise developing SDL abilities among teachers to foster effective learning and provide appropriate learner support (see Chapter 3) (Olivier 2022).

The  4IR  emphasises  the  urgency  of  improving  SDL  competencies  to meet the educational landscape's evolving demands (Olivier 2022). Atibuni, Manyiraho and Nabitula (2022) and Taylor (2019) underscore the need for teachers  to  possess  adequate  knowledge  and  readiness  to  navigate challenges inherent to South African schools. Chisholm (2019) stresses the importance of equipping learners with skills for a technologically advanced world. Adaptability and SDL skills are essential for all stakeholders in the academic  spectrum  (Selvi  2011).  These  competencies  are  increasingly critical  as  the  4IR  transforms  various  sectors,  necessitating  a  robust understanding of its core principles.

Zhelyazkova (2021) outlines the key 4IR principles, including interoperability, information transparency, decentralisation, real-time capabilities and flexibility. Integrating these principles into classrooms is challenging,  particularly  in  South  Africa,  where  the  education  system struggles with performance issues (Centre for Development and Enterprise 2023). The education system must focus on interdisciplinary knowledge and technology skills to improve outcomes and address foundational gaps hindering learner engagement with 4IR tools. A multidisciplinary approach is  crucial  to  addressing  the  shortage of qualified teachers and adapting curricula to include necessary SDL skills (Kayembe &amp; Nel 2019).

The 4IR Committee (Simpson 2020) suggests aligning the education system  with  4IR  demands,  including  technology-focused  curricula  and modernised  assessment  methods.  Despite  efforts  to  train  teachers  in computer skills and coding, there is a pressing need for self-directed novice teachers  to  implement  a  4IR-focused  curriculum.  The  education  system must  be  resilient,  adaptive  and  forward-thinking  to  meet  4IR  demands (DBE 2021). Addressing standardised curriculum guidelines and assessment requisites adds complexity, requiring teachers to balance fulfilling mandates

with  fostering  creativity  and  critical  thinking  (Marr  2019).  Consistent commitment to acquiring new proficiencies and adapting to the evolving educational milieu remains imperative (Kayembe &amp; Nel 2019).

## Problem statement

One of the main goals of contemporary educational methodologies is to promote learners' autonomy in designing and managing their own learning experiences. Moreover, these methodologies strive to empower learners to effectively  employ  their  learned  knowledge  in  practical  situations  by leveraging digital resources (The 4th Industrial Revolution and Its Impact on Education 2019). Novice teachers are required to demonstrate adaptability in  addressing  learners'  changing  needs  and  expectations  and  the  unique opportunities and challenges technology brings. Furthermore, Phillips and Condy  (2023)  assert  that  a  noticeable  disparity  between  theoretical understanding and practical implementation, usually known as the theory-practice gap, presents additional noteworthy challenges. Although these  novice  teachers  acquire  knowledge  about  4IR  and  SDL  and  their ramifications  during  their  university  education,  applying  this  theoretical understanding to develop successful educational practices that align with their learner's needs and interests may be challenging (Steyn 2004).

However,  according  to  Callahan  (2016),  the  collaboration  between higher education teacher training institutions and schools fostering practice teaching does not promote the development of self-directedness in novice teachers enough. Consequently, practice teaching experience often does not  provide  sufficient  opportunities  for  novice  teachers  to  exercise autonomy, initiative and reflection in their learning and teaching. Instead, they follow their mentor's and supervisors' prescribed curriculum, methods and assessment without critically examining their beliefs, assumptions and practices (Hine &amp; Thai 2018).

As a result, these novice teachers frequently lack the knowledge and experience necessary for self-direction concerning efficient classroom and self-management, subject knowledge and interpersonal interactions with learners and teachers (Hine &amp; Thai 2018). The lack of the knowledge and experience  necessary  for  self-direction  and  4IR  can  lead  to  frustration, stress,  anxiety  and  low  self-efficacy  among  novice  teachers,  negatively affecting  their  professional  performance  and  retention.  Research  shows that  novice  teachers  receiving  inadequate  training  or  preparation  are likelier to quit within the first five years (Sun 2016) because of a lack of knowledge and experience. This finding underscores the critical need for comprehensive teacher training programmes that effectively equip novice teachers with the necessary skills and knowledge. This chapter's research tried to answer the following questions:

How does the current curriculum for training teachers help new teachers gain  the  subject  knowledge  and  self-direction  they  need  to  deal  with problems in the school system and meet the needs of the 4IR? What factors influence the effectiveness of teacher training in equipping novice teachers with  the  necessary  content  knowledge  and  self-directedness  for  the challenges of the schooling system and the 4IR?

The research questions are designed to investigate the extent to which the current teacher training curriculum aligns with the chapter's aims. The first  question  examines  how  well  the  curriculum  fosters  both  subject knowledge and SDL, essential for novice teachers to address school system challenges  and  adapt  to  the  demands  of  the  4IR.  The  second  question delves into identifying the factors that affect the effectiveness of teacher training  programmes  in  achieving  these  competencies.  Together,  these questions aim to provide insights into how teacher training can be improved to better prepare novice teachers for the complexities of modern education and the integration of SDL strategies.

## Theoretical framework

Swanson (2013, p. 122) explicitly asserts that '… [ ]he theoretical framework t is the structure that can hold or support a theory of a research study …'. The theoretical framework is a blueprint that researchers often borrow in constructing their research enquiry (Mensah et al. 2020). The theoretical framework serves as the groundwork for conducting research. Vygotsky (1978) defines the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) as:

[ T ]he  distance  between  the  actual  development  level  as  determined  by independent  problem-solving  and  the  level  of  potential  development  as determined through problem-solving under adult guidance or in collaboration with a more capable peer. (p. 86)

Also,  Guvesa  and  Solomonovich  (2017)  define  ZPD  as  a  spectrum  of demanding tasks  that  individuals  cannot  master  independently  but  can achieve  successfully  with  the  assistance  of  skilled  peers  or  adults.  This perspective  highlights  the  importance  of  collaboration  and  guidance  in achieving  higher  levels of understanding  and  skill. Novice  teachers frequently have many challenging responsibilities throughout their initial years in the teaching profession. These responsibilities fall within the ZPD, as they often require support from more experienced colleagues. Several teachers encounter significant stress levels resulting from the expectation that they must independently complete these demanding responsibilities, such as preparation, disciplinary actions and administrative tasks, relying solely  on  the  knowledge  and  abilities  acquired  through  their  practical teaching  experiences  (Richards  &amp;  Farrell  2016).  This  expectation  often leads to overwhelming pressure and can hinder their professional growth.

Hence, the ZPD emerges as a crucial framework that necessitates careful consideration. Its significance lies in its ability to guide the training and support of novice teachers by more experienced peers, enabling them to accomplish teaching responsibilities and foster SDL effectively. One further pedagogical notion that seeks to enhance the self-directedness of novice teachers is utilising the social constructivist technique known as scaffolding. The  partnership  between  a  proficient  peer  and  a  novice  teacher  in knowledge and skill  development  is  paramount.  According  to  Heilmann (2018), scaffolding is a cognitive learning process that involves collaborative interactions between a learner and a knowledgeable adult or peer.

Additionally, according to Schwab (2016), emotional intelligence is the fundamental basis for acquiring SDL skills necessary for success in the 4IR era. These skills include self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy,  self-direction  and  social  skills.  The  affective  variables  also contribute to the development of self-directedness. Therefore, adequately preparing both learners and teachers for the 4IR entails more than simply incorporating  technology  and  providing  training  on  new  technologies. It also  involves  fostering  interpersonal  connections  and  relationships. Interpersonal connections and relationships are important in the context of preparing  for  the  4IR,  especially  relevant  when  individual  collaborative efforts are deemed suitable in a learning environment.

## Literature review

In South Africa, teachers need better disciplinary knowledge resources and academic  expertise  to  enhance  the  quality  of  education.  Self-directed learning is an essential skill for teachers in the 21st century, allowing them to adapt to the changing demands of the 4IR. Novice teachers in South Africa often  lack  self-direction  and  pedagogical  skills,  highlighting  the  need  for support and guidance during the induction period. Job demands, such as workload and managerial skills, can lead to burnout among teachers, while low  job  satisfaction  and  inadequate  support  contribute  to  high  turnover rates. In their early careers, novice teachers with three years or less experience face  additional  stress  and  challenges.  Addressing  these  issues  in  teacher training  programmes  is  crucial  for  improving  the  education  system.  This research  concentrates  on  the  following  key  concepts:  novice  teachers, teacher training, SDL, teacher job demands and job satisfaction.

## Novice teachers

Ngwira  and  Potokri  (2019)  define  and  explain  a novice  teacher as  a credentialed individual who has been teaching for three years or less. These teachers  actively  participate  in  educational  programmes  and  workforce

preparedness initiatives to enhance their professional growth. The aim is to provide SDL opportunities for novice teachers to support the development of their teaching practice during the early stages of their teaching careers. According to Harmsen et al. (2018), the teaching profession has the highest stress levels in European countries. High stress levels are attributed to the increased vulnerability of new teachers who experience burnout symptoms and deal with significant workloads.

Moreover, a study in the United States categorises novice teachers as individuals  who  enter  the  professional  domain  in  vulnerable  conditions marked  by  a  lack  of  practical  experience  and  exposure  to  challenging teaching environments. These circumstances ultimately negatively affect their general well-being, frequently leading to a high rate of professionals leaving the field during the first year of employment (Harmsen et al. 2018). Du Plessis and Letshwene's (2020) findings show numerous difficulties in transitioning inexperienced teachers into the full-time educational sector, even though teaching practicums are currently in place in South Africa and are intended to provide teaching training. Experiencing an unexpected and demanding  situation  in  the  real  world,  sometimes  called  a  'real-world shock',  presents  a  significant  existential  risk  for  novice  teachers  (Van Tonder  &amp;  Fourie  2018,  p.  1336).  The  phenomenon  contradicts  their preconceived notions about their teaching duties, directly threatening their professional development (Botha &amp; Rens 2018). In line with Curry, Webb and  Latham  (2016),  novice  teachers  face  formative  encounters  that profoundly  impact  their  professional  trajectory  and  future  identities throughout their early teaching years.

## Teacher training

Teacher training is the formal educational process through which prospective teachers acquire knowledge and establish skills necessary for their  profession (Al-Mahrooqi &amp; Denman 2018). The empirical data from several studies demonstrate that teachers influence learners' performance the  most  (Deacon  2016;  Trif  2020).  Almost  all  nations  invest  in  the educational  workforce  during  the  training  phase  or  before  they  begin working in schools (Goldhaber 2019). Some empirically supported hints indicate that teachers' preparation could be improved (Goldhaber 2019). Surveys  of recent novice teachers reveal that they frequently feel underprepared  for  the  plethora  of  challenges  they  must  face  in  the classroom, particularly  in  classroom  management (Kiru 2020; Kozikoglu 2017; Obadire &amp; Sinthimule 2021; Reitman &amp; Karge 2019; Schonert-Reichl, Kitil &amp; Hanson-Peterson 2017).

According to research by Goldhaber, Grout and Huntington-Klein (2016) and Jacob et al. (2016), educational systems can identify attributes in job

applicants that indicate whether they will be successful in the classroom. These findings imply that there are quantifiable skills that can be used to predict  teacher  effectiveness  and  that  there  are  abilities  that  novice teachers may initially struggle with but will develop proficiency early in their  careers.  The  authors  of  this  chapter  believe  that  novice  teachers would benefit significantly if some of these abilities could be incorporated into  their  preservice  coursework,  as  concerns  about  the  quality  and methods employed in teacher training  programmes  within  South  Africa have  been  raised.  Darling-Hammond  (2023)  believes  that  enhancing teachers'  disciplinary  knowledge  and  pedagogic  expertise  is  crucial  for improving South Africa's education quality. Without significant improvements in these areas, any other efforts will likely face limitations in their effectiveness.

In their study, Kimathi and Rusznyak (2018) analysed four policy frameworks employed in regulating,  monitoring  and  evaluating  South  African  teachers throughout the previous two decades. Kimathi and Rusznyak's (2018) research discovered  that  these  frameworks  impose  limitations  on  teacher  professionalism by  selectively  focusing  on  specific  characteristics  of  professional  teaching while neglecting others. Engelbrecht's (2020) study on inclusive education has revealed that initial teacher-teaching programmes in South Africa fail to adequately address the growing need for newly qualified teachers who can effectively teach in inclusive classrooms. Therefore, it is vital to enhance the self-directedness of novice teachers in South Africa by providing them with more support and guidance during their induction period. Incorporating SDL strategies into teacher training programmes is essential for equipping novice teachers  with  the  skills  they  need  to  navigate  the  complexities  of  their profession and promote lifelong learning.

## Self-directed learning

Self-directed learning refers to a cognitive process when individuals assume responsibility for their learning, exerting control over many aspects, such as learner attributes, which include self-efficacy and encouragement (Du Toit-Brits 2019). On the other hand, self-directedness is a broader concept that refers to a person's overall ability to guide their actions and behaviours, including but not limited to learning (Du Toit-Brits 2019). It is about being proactive,  taking  initiative  and  being  responsible  for  one's  actions.  Selfdirectedness can influence novice teachers' willingness to engage in SDL (Linkous 2020). Novice teachers demonstrate resilience, adaptability and the ability to pursue their ambitions proactively. In summary, while SDL is about taking control of one's learning process, self-directedness is a more general trait that can influence a person's approach to many aspects of life, including learning.

Academic  discourse  has  paid  considerable  attention  to  the  issue  of teachers' capacity to independently direct their learning (Mentz &amp; Van Zyl 2016). According to Raemdonck, Thijssen and De Greef (2017), self-directedness  in  teaching  and  learning  comprises  several  essential elements.  These  include  recognising  one's  learning  needs,  establishing goals,  selecting  appropriate  learning  approaches,  and  evaluating  and altering the learning process. From Knowles's (1975) definition, as seen in Chapter 1, five key aspects contribute to SDL. These are (1) setting learning goals,  (2)  identifying  resources,  (3)  selecting  resources,  (4)  selecting appropriate strategies and (5) evaluating learning outcomes. Building on these foundational principles, teachers recognise the value of incorporating SDL methodologies into their practices. Teachers must develop SDL skills to be effective SDL agents who can set learning goals, identify and evaluate resources,  select  appropriate  facilitating  strategies  and  evaluate  their teaching (Morris 2019). Additionally, SDL promotes lifelong learning, which teachers require for professional growth (Van Tonder &amp; Du Toit 2020).

Moreover, teachers are advised to create supportive SDL environments by  employing  effective  teaching  strategies.  These  strategies  include motivating learners to acquire knowledge and develop the skills necessary for independent and meaningful learning (Du Toit-Brits 2019). Additionally, teachers should possess an actual drive for the subject matter and strive to foster  this  enthusiasm  in  their  learners.  Encouraging  independence  in learning, utilising teaching methods that require active learner participation and  collaboration,  and  maintaining  positive  expectations  for  learners' development are essential elements in fostering SDL in learning environments (Wittmann &amp; Olivier 2021).

Botha and Rens (2018, p. 3) investigated novice teachers' reality shock in  South Africa. Using the 'ready, willing, and able' model developed by Shulman and Shulman in 2004, the researchers analysed the participants' experiences. The research conducted by Botha and Rens is significant to the notion of self-direction as it centres on novice teachers' initial intellectual and  affective  growth.  Nonetheless,  some  novice  teachers  lacked  the required  preparation  for  their  teaching  positions.  The  lack  of  necessary preparation is evidenced by their challenges in effectively cultivating and nurturing the abilities of their learners, their inadequate understanding of pedagogical  principles,  their  difficulties  in  managing  the  demanding teaching schedule and their uncertainty regarding the adequacy of their HEI's training in preparing them for the practical aspects of teaching. Botha and  Rens'  research  findings  indicate  that  novice  teachers  have  limited self-direction and pedagogical skills.

Gavriel (2015) posits that the three essential elements of self-direction encompass  competence,  motivation  and  self-confidence.  Noguera  and

McCluskey (2017) assert that novice teachers often encounter challenges applying  the  theoretical  concepts  they  acquired  during  their  university studies. The concerns raised might be ascribed to Mentz and De Beer's (2020) argument that HEI often prioritises theoretical elements excessively, neglecting  the  integration  of  real-world  applications.  According  to  Van Tonder  (2021),  recently  certified  teachers  with  less  than  four  years  of teaching experience are advised to engage in a recalibration process. This process should consider several factors, including the school's success and the teachers' professional development and self-directedness (Arends &amp; Phurutse 2009). Given these demands on novice teachers to develop SDL skills,  it  is  crucial  to  examine the various job demands they face in their professional roles.

## Teacher job demands

Increased job demands are directly related to burnout (Bakker, Demerouti &amp; Schaufeli 2003; Demerouti &amp; Bakker 2011; Madigan &amp; Kim 2021). Physical, social, organisational and psychological factors that require employees to exert effort to achieve individual and organisational objectives are called job  demands  (Bakker  &amp;  De  Vries  2021;  Lesener,  Guys  &amp;  Wolter  2019). Various dimensions, such as emotional demands, family conflict, workload, role conflict and ambiguity, non-availability or lack of autonomy, promotions, scholarships, administrative duties and organisational role stressors, have been used to measure job demands in different professions in developing countries (Granziera, Collie &amp; Martin 2021).

According to Skaalvik (2015), novice teachers commonly express the personal stress they suffer caused by the significant workload associated with the teaching profession. In addition, novice teachers are assigned to complete various educational and administrative responsibilities efficiently (Manuel, Carter &amp; Dutton 2018). However, the fields of management and leadership present challenging aspects that inexperienced teachers struggle  with  regarding  skilfulness.  These  aspects  generate  increased anxiety and feelings of inadequacy, especially when experienced teachers demonstrate these competencies with a significant level of confidence and self-direction (Perlshtein 2015). Therefore, this viewpoint emphasises that many inexperienced  teachers  continue  to  face  difficulties  in  developing proficiency in managerial abilities. As a result, they can significantly benefit from the mentorship of experienced teachers who excel in these areas.

However,  the  Department  of  Education  (2000)  predicted  that,  like experienced teachers, novice teachers are required to deliver a curriculum and comply with the prescribed statutory frameworks that offer guidelines for teaching and learning. The substantial job demands placed on novice

teachers not only lead to stress and burnout but also significantly impact their overall job satisfaction.

## Job satisfaction

Locke (1969)  defines job  satisfaction as  emotional  well-being,  gratitude and fulfilment when one achieves professional goals. Also, Evans (1997) defines job satisfaction as the extent to which employees feel their needs related to their jobs are met. According to these economists' definitions (Evans 1997; Locke 1969), job satisfaction is the satisfaction teachers report having with their working environment as they achieve their professional goals.  As  noted  by  Lopes  and  Oliveira  (2020),  critical  components  of professional expertise, such as teacher subject-matter knowledge, teaching experience and professional development, may influence job satisfaction and the desire to leave the profession. The level of job satisfaction among novice teachers in South Africa is relatively low. Compared to their more experienced  counterparts,  novice  teachers  reported  significantly  lower levels  of  job  satisfaction  (Iwu,  Benedict,  &amp;  Tengeh  2013).  A  study  by Crickmer (2007) shows that novice teachers in South Africa exhibited an average job satisfaction mean of 3.7 out of 5. The study identified several issues,  including  workload,  colleague  support  and  school  management, which  received  the  lowest  participant  scores.  Robinson  (2015)  recently researched and found that South African new teachers had an average job satisfaction mean of 3.8 out of 5. The study further revealed that the causes of  the  lowest  scores  included  workload,  inadequate  experience  and insufficient compensation. Teachers may also express discontentment with the absence of job stability, given that they are frequently engaged under temporary  contractual  arrangements.  This  circumstance  can  challenge individuals regarding financial stability and lead to professional discontent (Lumadi 2008).

Novice teachers often experience a feeling of being overwhelmed by the various challenges inherent in their profession, including but not limited to managing large classes, addressing behavioural issues and contending with  limited  access  to  teaching  materials  and  tools  (Mokoena  2023). Insufficient  possibilities  for  training  and  development,  coupled  with  the perception among novice teachers that they are ill-equipped to face the demands of teaching and lack ample opportunities for professional growth, are  prevalent  concerns.  Novice  teachers  regularly  have  challenges  in effectively managing learner misbehaviour, resulting in increased levels of stress  and  diminished  satisfaction  (Matla  &amp;  Xaba  2020).  Inexperienced teachers  encounter  a  lack  of  assistance  from  school  administrators, including limited access to coaching and mentorship.

Additionally,  limited  access  to  coaching  and  mentorship  could  add  to discontentment.  Inexperienced  teachers  frequently  experience  a  lack  of support  from  the  education  system,  leading  to  isolation  and  solitude (Reitman &amp; Karge 2019). Obadire and Sinthimule (2021) report that novice teachers face unfavourable working conditions when assigned to schools with  substandard  facilities,  insufficient  resources,  and  elevated  violence and  criminal  activities.  Jinot  and  Madhuree  (2020)  assert  that  these circumstances can present challenges in establishing a conducive learning atmosphere  for  learners.  This  can  also  provide  challenges  in  delivering high-quality  education  to  their  learners.  According  to  Botha  and  Hugo (2021),  the  low  job  satisfaction  of  novice  teachers  in  South  Africa  is  a significant problem, as it might result in high teacher turnover rates. The phenomenon above can adversely affect the overall education standard as it  necessitates  a  perpetual  cycle  of  replacing  seasoned  teachers  with inexperienced ones.

## Methodology

According  to Leedy  and  Ormrod  (2019),  the concept  of research methodology  encompasses  the many  research methods  and tools employed in the execution of a study. This section provides an overview of the  research  design,  the  target  population,  and  the  data  collection  and analysis methods. Additionally, the researchers address other significant factors, including sampling methods and ethical implications.

## Research design, strategy and data collection

In the field of hermeneutics or interpretivism, it is crucial to understand the perspectives of the individuals being studied. Consequently, the researcher must obtain a comprehensive understanding of the cultural background of the  participants  to  adequately  grasp  their  unique  perspectives  and concerns regarding the topic being studied (Hammersley 2022). Therefore, the researchers used this paradigm in this study to develop an overview of the participants' perspectives on the practical elements of novice teachers' experiences.  The  interpretivism  paradigm  encompassed  a  review  of whether the curriculum for teacher training provided them with sufficient knowledge of subject matter and SDL skills to overcome challenges in their teaching methods.

A more profound comprehension of how participants construct their realities,  evaluate  their  experiences and assign significance to them was achieved  by  employing  essential  qualitative  research  approaches.  The primary  objective  of  basic  qualitative  research  is  to  investigate  the mechanisms through which humans derive meaning from their everyday

lives and circumstances (Merriam &amp; Tisdell 2015). According to Nieuwenhuis (2020), qualitative research focuses on identifying and understanding the social  and  cultural  factors  that  underlie  certain  behavioural  attitudes. Moreover,  the  qualitative  study  aims  to  investigate  enquiries  about  the complexities of a phenomenon by defining it and understanding it from the viewpoints of the participants engaged in it.

Nieuwenhuis  (2020)  asserts  that  qualitative research focuses  on understanding  the  social  and  cultural  contexts  underpinning  various behavioural beliefs. Furthermore, this research specifically aimed to explore the  teachers'  lived  experiences  regarding  whether  their  teacher  training curriculum equipped them with the necessary content knowledge and selfdirectedness to overcome challenges in their teaching practice. Therefore, the researchers followed qualitative-phenomenological research to explore the novice teachers' written reflections about their experiences concerning efficient classroom management, subject knowledge supplied by various higher education teacher training institutions and their perceptions about their SDL.

This chapter's data focus on the reflection data. Qualitative, phenomenological research was performed on the participants' immediate experiences  (Leedy  &amp;  Ormrod  2015)  to  find  out  if  the  current  teacher training  curriculum  prepares  novice  teachers  well  enough  to  be  selfdirected and with enough content knowledge to gain the understanding they lack to overcome the job demands and to be self-directed in their learning environments.

## Participant selection

The authors used non-probability purposive sampling and approached novice teachers willing to reflect on a research project with ethical clearance from a South African University's Research Ethics Committee (01224-20-S2). The sample  represents  a  heterogeneous  group  of  novice  teachers  (30)  who completed  their  teaching  qualifications  at  a  South  African  University representing different subject areas. Participants completed the reflections anonymously.

## Trustworthiness of the research

The researchers meticulously followed the prescribed parameters to uphold the study's credibility. To achieve this goal, saving the original transcripts for  verification  was  crucial.  Furthermore,  the  auditable  requirement  was supported by using verbatim descriptions and direct declarations (Shenton 2004).  Moreover,  preserving  the  original  transcripts  was  considered essential for verification. According to Mertler and Charles (2011), the study

maintained  methodological  consistency  for  an  extended  duration  to establish  dependability.  To  strengthen  the  study's  dependability,  the researchers thoroughly outlined the methodologies utilised, enabling the replication of the investigation and fostering confidence in the resulting research  findings.  Mertens  (2010)  posits  that  transferability  involves  the recognition of comparable circumstances that can be utilised as illustrations to showcase the diverse interpretations of data across multiple contexts and viewpoints. To examine the transferability component of qualitative research, the researchers presented a thorough portrayal of the findings, allowing them to determine its applicability in comparable settings. The study's  emphasis  on  individuals  and  situations  presents  difficulties  in determining the generalisability of the broader populations and contexts.

## Data analysis and results

A thematic analysis was employed to analyse the reflection data. Emergent themes  and  sub-themes  were  identified  within  the  data  to  allow  the subjective meaning of the participants' answers to be reflected (Willig &amp; Rogers 2017). ATLAS.ti™ was used to extract the themes and sub-themes. The most meaningful responses to support the identified themes and subthemes are  presented  as  direct  verbatim  quotations  from  the  raw  data. Inductively, interesting and additional themes and sub-themes that did not directly  relate  to  the  two  focus  points  were  also  identified  in  the  data (Table 4.1).

## Theme 1: Teachers and self-directed learning

Under theme 1, two sub-themes emerged from the data. Under the first sub-theme,  SDL  skills  only  began  to  be  exhibited  when  the  teacher participants had a clear gap in their knowledge and skills regarding their teaching  practice.  The  participants  did  not  report  on  self-directed  skills obtained  throughout  the  BEd  curriculum.  SDL  behaviour,  however,  was evident  in  being  promoted  by  the  BEd  curriculum.  Under  the  second sub-theme, the participants were inclined to resort to autonomously taking over their learning process; they engaged in self-reflection and collaborated with others.

## Sub-theme: Self-directed learning skills fostered in practice

The  participants  observed  that  the  BEd  curriculum  needed  to  be revised to enable  them  to  continuously  grow  professionally.  The participants indicated that practical teaching enabled them to identify gaps in their knowledge and skills required to improve their teaching practice:

'It was not the degree that enabled me to identify the gap; it was experience in the classroom that showed the gap which I then researched to try and fill the gap.' (Participant L)

Based on their practical experiences, the participants identified a lack of knowledge  and  skills  in  their  teaching  practice.  Through  independent research, they supplemented their self-identified lack of knowledge and skills in their teaching practice:

'Like I said I continuously research things I don't know and keep on finding out more on my own.' (Participant I)

Participants mentioned that learning from more experienced teachers was also an approach to filling the void left by the BEd curriculum. Again, when they  were  exposed  to  a  practical  teaching  environment,  did  they  seek human resources to aid in their professional growth?

'To collaborate with other teachers and adopt good practices from experienced educators.' (Participant P)

## Sub-theme: Self-directed learning behaviours fostered

Even though the participants felt that the BEd curriculum did not adequately prepare  them  for  continuous  professional  development,  it  provided  a foundation for them to fill the gaps in their knowledge and skills required for professional growth:

'The curriculum gives a good foundation of the basics. I had to learn to adapt and to develop new strategies when I started teaching.' (Participant M)

Being held accountable during their studies assisted participants in laying the foundation for their self-directed professional growth:

'The BEd curriculum prepared me to develop and apply strategies for continuous and professional development by holding me, as a student, accountable for my studies and achievement.' (Participant Y)

Self-reflection was identified as a behaviour fostered by the BEd curriculum through the ability to assess oneself:

'Our curriculum focused a lot on self-reflection that had become second nature and  I  do  it  every  day  without  realising.  It  really  is  an  asset  when  teaching otherwise you won't grow professionally and personally.' (Participant I)

The BEd curriculum laid the foundation for collaboration by emphasising group work:

'Working  with  groups  at  campus  made  me  realise  that  I  can  do  better  with others.' (Participant S)

## Theme 2: Teacher perceptions of the BEd curriculum

Under theme 2, two sub-themes emerged from the data. Under the first sub-theme, the teacher participants highlighted the disparities  between the theory of the BEd curriculum and real-world teaching practice. Under the second sub-theme, the teacher participants emphasised that the BEd curriculum  is  lacking  in  bridging  the  gap  between  real-world  teaching practice and theory.

## Sub-theme: Theory and practice

The participants found it challenging to apply the various teaching and learning strategies taught in the BEd curriculum. The participants felt that the strategies were not realistic in the context of larger class sizes:

'Strategies  taught  is  for  small  classes  and  individual  teaching  where  creative thinking  takes  place.  Not  practical  as  school  classes  are  big  in  numbers.' (Participant X)

The core subject curriculum focused more on an academic approach to the content than a pedagogical one, leaving the participants unprepared to teach the content knowledge and skills:

'My core module classes did not prepare me for my practical teaching sessions as  we  focused  mainly  on  literature  analysis  and  essay  writing  but  never  the actual teaching of the content itself.' (Participant Y)

The BEd curriculum prepared the participants to apply various resources but did not prepare them to teach without resources. The participants were left unprepared to adapt or produce resources if there were none, ultimately hindering their self-directedness to reach specific teaching goals:

' At varsity level you get to deal with the most amazing forms of resources. You can use the internet, slide shows, PowerPoints. You have access to one of the best libraries in the country. The resources at varsity level are wonderful. Then you get to a rural school like mine, where there is almost never electricity or water. We have one laptop and one projector to use between 20 teachers. We do not have enough textbooks. No white boards, only chalk boards to use IF there is chalk. Hence, we are trained with the best equipment, instead of being trained to use no equipment. This is a huge issue in South African schools. It is no use to know how to work the internet, but your school does not even have electricity.' (Participant H)

The administrative tasks of a teacher were identified as a severe deficiency in the BEd curriculum:

'The course taught you about how to teach the work, but nothing about the other  tasks  of  a  teacher.  Things  like  admin,  communicating  with  parents, collaborating with colleagues etc. Managing the different types of learners in your class (especially behaviour and learning challenges) and balancing your workload was not even touched in the degree course.' (Participant M)

The BEd curriculum was lacking in its approach to addressing different barriers to learning, such as discipline and emotional and physical problems. Participants could, therefore, not ensure an inclusive teaching and learning experience in their classes:

'Discipline, handling  learners  with  emotional,  developmental  and  physical challenges.' (Participant 3)

## Sub-theme: Improving the BEd curriculum

The  participants  strongly  favoured  the  introduction  of  more  practical teaching  as  part  of  the  curriculum  to  address  the  discrepancies  they perceived in the curriculum:

'Give  students  more  practical  experience.  Not  only  to  observe,  let  them  set papers,  let  them  mark  them,  let  them  discipline  classes,  do  invigilation  for exams, sit in hearings etc. They need to know what is happening in schools, not a glittered version.' (Participant H)

## Discussion of results

From the responses of the teacher participants, the development of SDL skills during their initial teacher training was not evident. Only when they were placed in practical  teaching  circumstances  in  their  classrooms  did they begin to develop the ability to identify gaps in their existing knowledge and skills of their teaching practice. A significant gap that the participants identified was being left unprepared to work without a lack of resources. These  gaps  were  filled  through  self-study,  a  skill  that  was  not  directly attributed to their training nor specifically attributed to practical teaching.

Although  the  participants  did  not  explicitly  mention  SDL  skills  not nurtured by the curriculum, they did perceive that their training fostered the positive behaviour of being accountable for their learning and employing self-reflection. Being responsible and liable for one's professional development indicates individual autonomy. This behaviour is paramount for  a  self-directed  individual  to  possess  attributable  to  the  need  for individuals to take the initiative in the learning process (Knowles 1975). In addition, Sosibo (2019) explains that autonomy is central to SDL ascribed to the individual acting on intrinsic motivation to overcome autonomously

identified  gaps.  Self-reflection  is  also  necessary  because  it  is  part  of evaluating  (Helyer  2015),  a  skill  essential  for  self-directed  teachers  to evaluate their teaching (Morris 2019).

The  participants  noted  that  their  training  focused  on  a  multitude  of group work, which they credited for making it easier to collaborate with others. Knowles (1975) points out that finding and utilising human resources is a self-directed attribute. Still, the participants' further responses do not indicate a self-directed application of these human  resources.  The participants  noted  that  they  sought  guidance  from  more  experienced teachers to learn what they did not know. As Callahan (2016) and Hine and Thai (2018) point out, utilising human resources by relying too much on skilled teachers  may  not  promote  self-directedness  because  novice teachers do not exercise their autonomy, do not take the initiative and do not reflect on their teaching and learning. Overutilising human resources in the form of experienced teachers may lead the participants to not reflect on their teaching and learning when they identify gaps in their knowledge and skills, but only to find solutions from others, not always through their research.

Although  it  is  not  always  harmful  to  seek  guidance  from  more experienced  teachers,  the  problem  lies  in  the  process  needing  to  be structured and not solely relying on the process to be initiated by the novice teacher. Collaborating between a novice and experienced teacher that scaffolds knowledge  and  skills is necessary to foster selfdirectedness within a teacher (Robinson &amp; Persky 2020). The participants were eager to seek help from more experienced teachers. Knowles (1975, p.  18)  identifies  that  'individuals  should  take  the  'initiative',  with  or without the help of others…'; this 'help' does not refer to doing everything for another individual but assisting with the learning process. The help should thus not be interpreted as doing the work for the novice teacher but as guiding the novice teacher to develop their knowledge and skill, otherwise known as scaffolding (Kicken, Brand-Gruwel &amp; Van Merriënboer 2008; Robinson &amp; Persky 2020). Additionally, this provided 'help' should promote  autonomy  so  that  an  individual  is  intrinsically  motivated  by controlling the learning process and promoting self-directedness (Ferlazzo 2023).

Although collaboration between novice and experienced teachers is highly promoted (Majocha et al. 2017), initial teacher training may be blamed for overburdening experienced teachers owing to not focussing on a more well-rounded initial teacher training. As participants noted, the curriculum focused more on theory and needed to be more practical in their classroom practice. Real-life problems such as weak discipline, physical and emotional barriers, being under-resourced and large classes

requiring more focus on the curriculum leave novice teachers unprepared when they enter schools. The participants wished that the curriculum would  not  only  focus  on  relevant  theory  and  teaching  and  learning strategies  but  also  focus  on  actual  real-life  teaching  contexts,  where they  could  learn  how  to  apply  what  they  have  theoretically  learned practically. Other than a gap between curriculum theory and teaching practice, the participants also pointed out that they were unprepared for  many  administrative  tasks,  including  paperwork  and  dealing  with parents.

The participants felt that the BEd curriculum did not fully prepare them to teach. Because SDL skills are not emphasised, it does not prepare them for lifelong professional development. While demonstrating a willingness to enhance their teaching and learning practices, novice teachers encountered  a  significant  deficiency  in  their  SDL  endeavours.  However, they  acquired  some  abilities  through  practical  teaching  experiences.  In addition to the lack of school support, inexperienced teachers may not be encouraged to engage in SDL. Instead, they may be expected to adopt an adapt-or-die approach. The lack of preparation for self-directed teachers within the BEd curriculum and schools hinders their ability to effectively incorporate SDL principles into their teaching and learning methodologies (Boser 2017; Fashant et al. 2020; Haiyan et al. 2017; Harrington 2018; Morris 2019; Van Wyk 2017). As Francom (2010) explains, SDL principles are to ensure:

- · the level of SDL in activities is equal to a learner's level of self-directedness
- · learning gradually becomes more learner-directed
- · progress from teacher to learner direction of learning over time
- · support in the acquisition of subject matter knowledge and SDL skills together
- · self-directed learning skills and subject knowledge are parallelly grown
- · learners practice SDL in the context of learning tasks
- · contextualisation of SDL within the teaching and learning tasks.

In addition to being unable to incorporate SDL principles, the participants were also left unprepared regarding the content knowledge and skills. This unpreparedness is attributable to them being trained to approach subject content more academically. This unpreparedness left a gap in their ability to teach the subject content. The unsatisfactory feeling of the participants regarding their training in the subject content and skills points to a lack of pedagogical  knowledge  and  skills  rather  than  actual  subject  content knowledge and skills.

The  teacher  participants  also  indicated  that the BEd  curriculum focused  on  preparing  novice  teachers  for  'ideal'  circumstances  rather

than  real-world  contexts.  What  can  be  gathered  from  the  participant responses is that the BEd curriculum focuses on aspects of the 4IR, such as technology  and  collaboration.  Still,  it  does  not  prepare  them  to  bring learners  to  the  required  level  to  function  effectively  in  classrooms  that incorporate aspects of the 4IR in their teaching. There is no scaffolding to the 4IR knowledge and skills, just a fall-in or fall-out approach in the BEd curriculum.

## Limitations of the study

The empirical data utilised in this study was collected through open-ended questionnaires in the form of reflections. Despite the explicit instruction for participants to provide detailed explanations in their responses, a subset of participants  opted  to  offer  brief  answers.  While  some  responses  lacked depth, they were nevertheless concise and aligned with the existing body of literature.

## Recommendations

Recommendations based on the findings can include:

- 1. Revise the BEd  curriculum : The  study  highlights the need  to revise  the  curriculum  to  better  prepare  teacher  candidates  for  the demands  of  real-world  teaching.  That  said,  the  revision  should be  focused  on  SDL  skill  development  in  the  entire  programme. Practical  teaching  experiences,  administrative  tasks  and  strategies should  also  be  incorporated  into  the  curriculum  to  aid  teaching  in resource-constrained environments.
- 2. Incorporate SDL principles into the BEd curriculum : Ensure prospective teachers are equipped with the required skills for continuous professional development by integrating SDL principles into the curriculum. In addition, emphasis should be on developing SDL behaviours such as accountability, self-assessment and self-reflection.
- 3.  Provide prospective teachers with more practical teaching experiences, including  opportunities  to  collaborate  with  colleagues,  create  lesson plans, discipline students and manage classrooms. The experiences they are exposed to should reflect real-world scenarios to decrease the gap between theory and practice.
- 4.  Enhance  the  focus  on  pedagogical  knowledge  and  skills  in  the  BEd curriculum.  Teacher  candidates  should  be  better  prepared  to  teach subject content effectively, especially in contexts with large class sizes and limited resources.
- 5.  Ensure that prospective teachers are ready and prepared to facilitate learning  in  environments  that  promote  collaboration  and  the  use  of

technology  by  developing  strategies  to  integrate  4IR  elements  into teacher education programmes.

- 6.  Schools  should  provide  support  and  mentoring  for  novice  teachers, emphasising a structured approach to collaboration with experienced educators. Encourage novice teachers to take initiative, reflect on their teaching, and gradually develop self-directedness.

## Conclusion

This chapter focused on how facilitating SDL among learners by integrating SDL  into  the  BEd  curriculum  can  enhance  learner  involvement  and motivation and improve educational experiences and achievements. The literature points to novice teachers needing more training and preparation for self-direction, leading to frustration and low self-efficacy. In turn, it can lead novice teachers in South Africa to struggle with workload because of a lack of support and inadequate skills and experience in management and leadership.  As  a  result,  their  job  satisfaction  is  relatively  low,  which  can contribute to high turnover rates in the profession. Based on the empirical evidence,  it  can  be  inferred  that  participants  did  not  acquire  SDL  skills throughout  their  initial  teacher  training.  The  participants  in  this  study demonstrated the capacity to recognise deficiencies in their knowledge and address them through self-study only after being exposed to real-world teaching scenarios.

Nevertheless, the participants involved in this study acknowledged that the training they received played a significant role in promoting their sense of responsibility for their educational development and the cultivation of self-reflective thinking. These attributes (see also Chapter 3) are considered fundamental components of SDL. The participants also saw that engaging in collaboration with teachers who possess significant expertise proved to be beneficial. The curriculum received criticism for its excessive emphasis on theoretical knowledge and insufficient focus on actual teaching abilities, resulting in novice teachers being inadequately equipped to address realworld  difficulties.  Overall,  the  participants  felt  that  the  BEd  curriculum needed to prepare them to teach adequately or for lifelong professional development.  The  need  for  SDL  skills in the BEd  curriculum  and schools creates a gap in preparing effective teachers who can integrate SDL principles into their teaching methodologies.

In  conclusion,  the  journeying  of  'Bridging  the  gap:  Nurturing  self-directedness in higher  education  teacher  training  and  teachers'  job  demands'  has accentuated  the  fundamental  role  of  nurturing  self-directedness  in  the professional  development  of  educators.  As  we  move  to  our  next  chapter, 'Improving  academic  success:  Cultivating  self-directed  learning  to  address

procrastination in higher distance education', it becomes evident that SDL extends beyond teacher training to influence students' academic success in higher distance education directly. This seamless joining between empowering educators  and  enhancing  student  self-directedness  sets  the  stage  for  a comprehensive discussion on strategies to cultivate SDL and tackle procrastination,  ultimately  contributing  to  a  more  effective  and  engaging educational landscape.

## Abstract

Academic procrastination, i.e., the irrational delay of important academic tasks, is a potentially harmful behaviour that is highly prevalent in higher education (HE), especially distance education (DE). Given the wide range of adverse outcomes, including mood, well-being and academic performance, interventions might benefit many students. In this chapter, we presented a framework that is aimed at reducing academic procrastination. It consists of a conceptual framework based on a theoretical foundation.  We  detailed  how  various  concepts  related  to  academic procrastination are linked, the crucial role that self-directed learning (SDL) can play, which intervention strategies have the highest potential and what the  associated  predictive  models  should  encompass.  The  framework's components  are showcased  through a use case 3 , namely, a Java programming course.  The  chapter  concludes  with  an  outlook  on  future research  that  is  necessary  to  lay  the  foundation  for  implementing  this framework.

## Introduction

The  preceding  chapter  focused  on  incorporating  self-directed  learning (SDL) strategies into higher education (HE) teacher training. This chapter aimed to promote academic success through the implementation of SDL in distance HE to address procrastination. These two chapters are linked in the sense that SDL is the overarching theme with the intention to employ SDL  to  improve  teaching  and  learning  experiences  while  addressing academic challenges. That said, procrastination is  commonly  conceptualised as the irrational delay of important tasks (cf. Steel 2007) and is a frequently encountered phenomenon that affects many situations in daily life. While procrastination  is  common  in  educational  settings  (academic  procrastination in this case), it is prevalent among students in HE, particularly in distance education (DE) (Rahimi &amp; Hall 2021; Svartdal 2017).

Importantly, procrastination cannot be blamed on intellectual differences between people who do and people who do not delay doing their tasks. As Steel (2007) points out, procrastinators typically realise the irrational nature of their behaviour. Instead, procrastination is thought to result from interpersonal differences in self-regulation, motivation and organisational skills (Rahimi &amp; Hall 2021; Steel et al. 2018; Wolters, Won &amp; Hussain 2017).

Some  approaches  also  suggest  that  personality  traits  are  contributing factors, such as perfectionism and the personality characteristics associated with the Dark Triad (cf. Lyons &amp; Rice 2014), while others highlight situational factors, such as the characteristics of the task at hand. In this context, selfregulation is a metacognitive skill that refers to monitoring, manipulating and improving one's learning, e.g., selecting and implementing appropriate learning strategies. Procrastination is strongly associated with selfregulatory issues, with some authors even defining it as a 'self-regulatory failure'  (Sirois  &amp;  Pychyl  2013),  e.g.,  a  lack  of  inhibition  capability,  which means that procrastinators have trouble regulating their thoughts, impulses, behaviour  and  emotions.  This  is  linked  to  low  conscientiousness,  high impulsivity, thought control issues and impaired mood regulation (Gustavson et al. 2014; Rebetez, Rochat &amp; Van der Linden 2015).

Procrastination is also thought to be a motivational issue because of its  association  with  low  self-efficacy  (i.e.  students  believing  that  they have the necessary capability or knowledge to complete their tasks), task aversiveness  (i.e.  a  strong  dislike  of  certain  types  of  tasks),  a  lack  of personal value of certain tasks, unclear or distant deadlines (i.e. reducing the  perceived  urgency  of  tasks),  inability  to  delay  gratification  and  a general lack of motivation (Grunschel, Patrzek &amp; Fries 2013; Rebetez et al. 2015). Moreover, procrastination is linked to insufficient time and effort management skills (Hailikari,  Katajavuori  &amp;  Asikainen  2021).  Procrastinators typically struggle with setting, prioritising and pursuing goals (e.g. Wang et  al.  2021).  Further  reasons  for  this  type  of  behaviour  include  fear  of failure  (i.e.  students  prefer  to  avoid  tasks  that  they  are  afraid  of  as  a consequence of low self-efficacy, for example); self-handicapping strategies (i.e. students sabotaging themselves so that they can attribute poor  performances  to  their  lack  of  effort,  rather  than  an  intellectual deficit,  which  preserves  their  self-worth)  (cf.  Schwinger  et  al.  2014); psychological reactance, which means a preference for options that are not available anymore (cf. Malatincová 2015); or decision paralysis (Shaffer &amp; Kazerouni 2021).

Unsurprisingly, procrastination can lead to various adverse outcomes, including unsatisfying performance, reduced mood, feelings of guilt and regret,  increased  stress,  lower  well-being  and  a  higher  risk  of  academic dropout (Bäulke, Eckerlein &amp; Dresel 2018; Grunschel et al. 2016; Oflazian &amp; Borders  2023).  Given  how  common  and  potentially  career-damaging procrastination is - especially in the long term - it is crucial to find ways to counteract it. One way to counter dilatory tendencies is to use SDL skills such  as  self-monitoring  and  self-management.  Self-directed  learning means  that  students  take  charge  of  their  learning  process,  as  per  the definition of Knowles (1975) provided in Chapter 1. As procrastination is

often conceptualised as self-regulation failure (as explained above), which means  that  students  fail  to  monitor  or  improve  their  learning  skills effectively, fostering SDL skills could be a viable countermeasure (Nemati, Shomal  Oskoei  &amp;  Saberi  2023;  Schommer-Aikins  &amp;  Easter  2018).  It  is suggested  that  students  could  improve  their  self-regulation  and  time management by increasing their self-directedness and thus decrease the risk  of  procrastinating  in  terms  of  their  academic  tasks.  One  reason procrastination is so common in DE is that this type of learning context requires students to have a high level of responsibility, persistence, attention and diligence  (Klingsieck  et  al.  2012;  You  2015).  Instead  of  an  educator taking  responsibility  for  structuring  the  students'  time  schedules  and workload in the classroom, DE relies on students handling their workload and time management by themselves (You 2015). In other words, it requires proficient use of SDL skills.

This chapter presents our conceptual framework for future studies on interventions to reduce procrastination in DE by fostering SDL skills. It is envisioned as a cyclical process: we predict procrastination via measurement of SDL, which forms the basis for interventions aimed at promoting SDL skills and targeting the reasons behind procrastination, in order to reduce procrastination,  followed  by  another  prediction  at  a  later  point  in  time, which  starts  the  cycle  anew.  This  conceptual  framework  is  based  on  a theoretical foundation, which is another important aspect of this chapter. The  theoretical  foundation  is  based  on  current  empirical  research  that showcases the relationship between procrastination, strategic delay, selfefficacy,  self-regulation  and  SDL and highlights our findings in this field (Imhof,  Bergamin  &amp;  McGarrity  2021;  Imhof  et  al.  2022).  The  theoretical foundation thus explains how the relevant variables are connected, while the conceptual framework entails a cyclical process that is used to predict procrastination and provide interventions to foster SDL.

As  the  envisioned  interventions  will  be  provided  within  a  learning management system (LMS) in a fast and scalable manner - be it semiautomated or fully automated - accurate predictions will be necessary, which  machine  learning  (ML)  models  can  provide.  To  illustrate  the framework, we present a Java programming course as a use  case and detail  what  kind  of  interventions  could  be  provided  in  LMSs  that  are frequently  used  in  DE.  We  also  highlight  our  computational  approach, which is based on prior research in this field (Imhof et al. 2021, 2022). The remainder of this chapter is organised into five sections. Firstly, we present our use case in detail and then explain our theoretical foundation. We then present the conceptual framework and discuss what intervention strategies could be employed as part of our envisioned predictive models. We end the chapter by providing an outlook on future research and our conclusions.

## Use case : Java programming course

This section presents our use case in detail: a Java programming course at the  Swiss  Distance  University  of  Applied  Sciences  (FFHS).  The  5-ECTS course, Java - Fundamentals, is a Computer Science bachelor programme module.  It  comprises  five  thematic  blocks  and  uses  a  blended  learning approach, so students learn partly independently in their spare time and partly through face-to-face lessons, either online or on campus. The ratio of self-paced learning to face-to-face lessons is 4:1. The latter are usually delivered on Saturdays or Monday evenings, as this suits most students at the FFHS, who have part-time or full-time jobs and cannot attend more classes in person. Each lesson is a repetition and extension of the content taught  on  Moodle's  LMS,  but  mostly  it  provides  an  opportunity  for theoretical  exercises  and  programming  tasks  and  projects.  The  course follows  a  flipped  classroom  approach:  before  each  lesson,  students  are expected  to  read  book  chapters  with  theoretical  content  about  Java (syntax,  data,  expressions,  classes,  objects,  conditionals,  loops,  objectoriented designs, inheritance, polymorphisms, exceptions, recursions and collections), solve quizzes to check their current knowledge and keep track of their progress, and solve programming tasks to prepare for the lesson. The  programming  exercises  are  a  mixture  of  mandatory  exercises  and voluntary bonus tasks. After solving more exercises during the lesson, the students complete the remaining uncompleted tasks at home. At the end of the course, which takes an entire semester (i.e. August to December), the students write a final exam, which accounts for 70% of the final grade; 12%  of  the  grade  is  allotted  to  pop  quizzes,  another  12%  is  for  the programming exercises submitted and the final 6% is for the presentation of exercises.

We chose this  course  because  learning  programming  languages  is  a unique  challenge  for  people  who  tend  to  procrastinate.  The  immediate error messages of the interpreter when trying to programme (even for the most minor errors) can cause frustration, which has a negative effect on self-efficacy and thus encourages further procrastination for people who respond  strongly  to  negative  feedback.  Frustration  is  one  of  the  most common emotions experienced by programming novices (Bosch, D'Mello &amp; Mills 2013). In our experience, this affects many programming beginners in  an  introductory  academic  course.  Procrastination  manifests  mainly  in the affected students not practising enough, as they cannot cope with the negative  feedback  provided  by  the  interpreter  and  thus  regularly  miss achieving the learning objectives. Acquiring programming skills requires practice through independent writing of code and dealing with interpreter feedback (Häberlein &amp; Häberlein-Klumpner 2017). This process is comparable to learning a natural language: only by applying and speaking

the language is proper acquisition possible. Moreover, many students fear learning  programming  languages  because  they  believe  programming  is complex and demands much mental effort (Yassine et al. 2017). This often leads  to  dissatisfactory  outcomes  (Shaffer  &amp;  Kazerouni  2021).  When designing interventions to address this issue, attention needs to be paid to aspects of the learning experience that may influence the success of these interventions. These aspects include the reasons for the delay in attending to coding assignments (such as task aversiveness, programming anxiety or lack of personal relevancy), task-specific characteristics (such as perceived or  actual  difficulty)  and  institutional  or  environmental  conditions.  These factors and other considerations are explored in the next section.

## Theoretical foundation

In this section, we provide the theoretical underpinnings of our conceptual intervention framework by highlighting prior research on procrastination, including  the  differences  between  procrastination  and  other  types  of dilatory  behaviour  (such  as  strategic  delay),  and  how  it  relates  to  SDL. This section also provides an overview of current empirical findings on the links between procrastination and SDL and other relevant learning concepts, such as academic self-efficacy. The section further details how SDL can be measured, which  includes  an  overview  of  commonly  used  SDL  questionnaires and  their  advantages  and  disadvantages.  We  further  point  out  which contextual factors for dilatory behaviour matter the most in DE, be they on a personal or an institutional level.

Given the negative consequences commonly associated with procrastination,  thinking  that  delaying  tasks  is  inevitably  maladaptive would  be  tempting.  However,  multiple  authors  have  suggested  that  a positive, productive counterpart to procrastination exists. While seemingly very  similar  on  the  surface,  this  behaviour  does  not  result  in  negative consequences.  This  type  of  dilatory  behaviour  was  originally  known  as active  procrastination (Chu  &amp;  Choi  2005),  and  it  is  distinguished  from damaging,  'passive'  procrastination.  As  this  is  arguably  an  oxymoron (as procrastination is often harmful) (cf. Chowdhury &amp; Pychyl 2018), other terms have gained favour. These include active delay (Corkin, Yu &amp; Lindt 2011), purposeful delay (Grunschel et al. 2013) and strategic delay (Klingsieck 2013). We will use the term strategic delay for the remainder of this chapter, as this term best reflects what sets the concept apart from procrastination for our purposes.

Strategic delay differs  from  procrastination  in  multiple  ways  but  also shares some similarities. As Klingsieck (2013) notes, both are acts of delay. There is an intention to begin or to complete a task, the task at hand is of personal  importance  or  otherwise  necessary,  and  the  delay  happens

voluntarily  in  both  cases,  i.e.,  there  is  no  outside  circumstance  that necessitates a delay. The differences between procrastination and strategic delay are indicated by aspects unique to each behaviour. Procrastination is characterised by the irrationality of the behaviour (as procrastinators delay attending  to  tasks  despite  being  fully  aware  of  the  consequences)  and subjective  discomfort,  among  other  negative  consequences. Strategic delay is characterised by a preference to work under pressure, i.e., strategic delayers purposefully increase pressure on themselves, as they need it to be adequately motivated; the ability to meet deadlines; higher levels of satisfaction;  and  intentionality  of  the  decision.  Strategic  delay  may  also involve prioritising other tasks, collecting more information before working on a task, attaining a state of cognitive flow and learning efficiently by maximising  performance  while  minimising  effort  (Kim  &amp;  Seo  2013; Klingsieck 2013).

This distinction is part of the theoretical foundation because interventions should consider whether an act of delay can be classified as procrastination  or  strategic  delay.  As  strategic  delay  does  not  lead  to adverse outcomes, interventions would be pointless at best and counterproductive at worst. After all, providing students with interventions they do not need is not only a waste of resources but may also overload and confuse them with superfluous information, which could potentially result in lower performance.

Another crucial distinction between the two types of dilatory behaviour is  the  level  of  self-efficacy. Self-efficacy is  an  individual's  belief  in  their capability to perform a task successfully (Bandura 1977). Academic selfefficacy is central to procrastination, as selecting appropriate strategies is crucial when beginning and completing tasks (cf. Wäschle et al. 2014). Low academic self-efficacy means that students are not confident about their metacognitive skills and are thus more prone to avoid their responsibilities (thus  to  procrastinate),  while  students  with  high  academic  self-efficacy choose successful strategies, which may involve strategic delay. Increased self-efficacy  is  also  associated  with  higher  motivation  and  persistence (Moreira-Fontán et al. 2019). Moreover, research has shown that procrastination is negatively related to self-efficacy and positively related to strategic delay (Chowdhury  &amp;  Pychyl  2018;  Corkin  et  al. 2011). Unsurprisingly,  procrastination  and  strategic  delay  are  negatively  linked (Corkin et al. 2011). The relationship can also be thought of as a vicious and virtuous circle. As Wäschle et al. (2014) note, students with low self-efficacy may fall into a vicious circle of procrastination because they view tasks as aversive and are thus less likely to engage with them. This decreases the chances of success, increases the likelihood of avoiding such tasks in the future and further decreases self-efficacy (Wäschle et al. 2014). However, a virtuous circle also works in the other direction: high self-efficacy increases

motivation, which makes the successful application of learning strategies more likely and increases self-efficacy again.

Self-efficacy is not the only academic concept that is strongly tied to procrastination  and  other  types  of  dilatory  behaviour.  Another  crucial factor  is self-regulation , which  is  often  considered  a  core  aspect  of procrastination as a concept, as evidenced by the conceptualisation of procrastination as a 'self-regulatory failure' (Sirois &amp; Pychyl 2013). Most models of self-regulation involve three core components that interact with each other (Wagner &amp; Heatherton 2014), i.e., an intended state, monitoring and regulation. The intended state can be a goal or a set of standards, e.g., finishing a course or learning regularly. Monitoring refers to awareness of one's action, comparing it to the intended state and setting off an alarm if the current action no longer aligns with the desired goal. To solve this conflict, the third component of regulation comes into play by inhibiting the competing impulses. Alternatively, self-regulation can be considered a set  of  learnable  skills:  setting  goals,  creating  strategies,  managing  time effectively, monitoring and evaluating progress, acknowledging the cause of the results and developing future goals (Schunk &amp; Zimmerman 2023). A failure of self-regulatory processes can then be triggered by negative emotions  (cf.  Villavicencio  &amp;  Bernardo  2013):  students  may  experience fear  of  failure  or  have  other  negative  feelings  about  their  tasks  (task aversiveness) and cope with these emotions by avoiding the stimulus - in this case a task - by procrastinating.

Self-regulation is also an essential skill involved in a popular learning concept,  namely,  SDL.  The  definition  of  SDL  provided  in  Chapter  1 emphasises a learner's autonomy, responsibility and initiative in the learning process.  Self-directed  learning  also  involves  learner  characteristics  (see Chapter  2),  such  as  self-efficacy  and  motivation  (Saeid  &amp;  Eslaminejad 2017). The proactive stance taken by self-directed learners to take initiative in  their  learning  process  can  assist  in  promoting  self-efficacy  (Murniati, Hartono  &amp;  Nugroho  2022).  Other  cornerstones  of  SDL  include  selfmonitoring, self-management, evaluation and regulation of the student's learning  (Zhu,  Bonk  &amp;  Doo  2020).  Self-regulation  is  one  of  the  primary dimensions of SDL, besides motivation and metacognition (Mentz &amp; Van Zyl 2018). Thus, based on the research presented above, procrastination is closely associated with self-regulation, self-efficacy, motivation and SDL. Prior research has shown that SDL is negatively linked to procrastination (Nemati et al. 2023; Schommer-Aikins &amp; Easter 2018) and positively linked to  self-efficacy  (Saeid  &amp;  Eslaminejad  2017).  Given  these  strong  links,  it appears to be a viable strategy to combat procrastination by promoting and fostering SDL.

As  our  conceptual  framework  is  at  least  semi-automated,  the  relevant concepts need to be assessed efficiently and need to be scalable (rather than  interviews  or  observations).  While  LMSs  allow  log  data  analysis, analysis of learning concepts such as self-efficacy, self-regulation and SDL relies  on  subjective  data  and  is  usually  measured  with  a  questionnaire. Several  questionnaires  have  been  developed  to  measure  SDL  skills, perceptions  and  tendencies,  i.e.,  the  Self-Directed  Learning  Readiness Scale (SDLRS) (Guglielmino 1977), the Self-Rating Scale of Self-Directed Learning (SRSSDL) (Williamson 2007), the Self-Directed Learning Instrument (SDLI) (Cheng et al. 2010), the Self-Directed Learning Aptitude Scale (SDLAS) (Abd-El-Fattah 2010) and the Self-Directed Learning Scale (SDLS) (Lounsbury et al. 2009).

Guglielmino  developed  the  SDLRS  to  assess  university  students' readiness  and  attitudes  towards  SDL.  The  original  version  consisted  of 41 items (Hoban et al. 2005), and the later version consisted of 57 items, with eight dimensions of the SDLRS being established, namely, openness to  learning  opportunities,  creativity,  ability  to  use  basic  study  skills, problem-solving skills, positive orientation to the future, self-concept as an effective learner and love of learning (Cadorin, Bressan &amp; Palese 2017). The SDLRS was not only used extensively but was also criticised, particularly regarding  its  validity  in  measuring  SDL  readiness  (Hoban  et  al.  2005). Further criticism reported a factor comprising mainly reverse-scored items (Chen &amp; Fan 2023).

The SRSSDL was developed and validated by Williamson (2007) in a study that focused on nursing students. The 60-item questionnaire revealed five dimensions: awareness, learning strategies, learning activities, evaluation and interpersonal skills (Liu et al. 2023). The SRSSDL provides a thorough  construct  to  measure  students'  SDL  skills  (Alotaibi  &amp;  Alanazi 2021). The SRSSDL has been used worldwide in several research papers that have indicated that it helps measure students' SDL skills, is relevant for multidisciplinary contexts and facilitates students' active engagement in learning (Williamson 2017).

The SDLI was also developed and validated among nursing students by Cheng  et  al. (2010). The  20-item  instrument  established  four  SDL dimensions:  motivation,  self-monitoring,  planning  and  execution,  and interpersonal  relationships  (Cadorin  et  al.  2017).  It  demonstrated  high internal consistency with a Cronbach's alpha, α = 0.916 (Cadorin et al. 2017). Cronbach's  alpha is a  common  measure  of  internal  consistency  that indicates the extent to which the scale items are consistent. The closer the value is to 1, the more consistent the scale is.

The  SDLAS  was  developed  to  measure  undergraduate  students'  SDL ability  and  comprises  26  Likert-scale  items.  The  dimensions  of  selfmanagement,  motivation  and  self-monitoring  were  established.  The internal consistency for the different dimensions was good: α = 0.82 for self-management; α = 0.84 for motivation; and α = 0.86 for self-monitoring (Abd-El-Fattah 2010).

These instruments are well established, but all share the drawback of having more than 20 items, which is quite time-consuming for students to fill in, especially if multiple rounds of measurement are necessary. A shorter alternative was created by Lounsbury et al. (2009) - the SDLS. It has only 10 items, which all load on the same factor and assess a student's capacity to learn without relying on others, e.g., finding the solution to a problem without having it spoon-fed beforehand. In our study (Imhof et al. 2021), we implemented the SDLS in a predictive model and obtained an internal consistency of α = 0.81. Each questionnaire has a role to play as determined by the context and goals of the study. By administering a questionnaire that measures students' SDL abilities and tendencies, valuable insight can be gained into students' readiness and predisposition to take responsibility for their learning process. Results from such a questionnaire could shed light on how SDL might mitigate or exacerbate a student's procrastination tendencies.

Delay can  be  measured  in  multiple  ways  as  well.  While  dilatory behaviour - whether maladaptive (like procrastination) or purposeful (like strategic  delay)  -  can  easily  be  assessed  via  log  data,  the  subjective component requires other approaches. Measuring procrastination requires distinguishing between trait and state as the two are correlated, but only on  a  moderate  level  (0.59)  (cf.  Krause  &amp;  Freund  2014).  It  is  still  highly debated whether procrastination is primarily a personality trait (as evidenced by its stability across time and different situations) (Steel 2007) or more dependent on contextual factors, such as task characteristics (Hoppe, Prokop &amp; Rau 2018; Nordby, Klingsieck &amp; Svartdal 2017). While procrastination is stable, Malatincová (2015) also notes that it is necessary to  distinguish  between the subjective experience of procrastination and the  actual  delay,  as  they  are  not  the  same  and  may  even  be  different constructs altogether.

In  order  to  minimise  the  effort  on  the  student's  part,  the  analysis  of behaviour  should  take  precedence  over  assessing  questionnaire  data whenever  possible.  Our  research  (Imhof  et  al.  2021,  2022)  shows  that predicting delay using log data (predicting behaviour with behaviour) also yields better results than when using trait variables as predictors. However, measuring SDL currently still requires the use of questionnaires. While some

results have been reported to suggest that learning concepts such as time management  skills  (Park  et  al.  2018)  and  self-regulation  (Li,  Baker  &amp; Warschauer 2020) can be approximated by analysing clickstream patterns as  indicators,  this  still  requires  more  research.  Thus,  questionnaires  still need to be included in our framework for now.

Apart from all the personal factors discussed thus far, environmental and  contextual  factors  can  also  help  explain  procrastination  and  other types of dilatory behaviour. As Nordby et al. (2017) point out, these factors have received much less attention in research than personal factors. They include  the  educator's  organisation  (Corkin  et  al.  2014),  setting  strict deadlines  (Bisin &amp;  Hyndman  2020),  the  previously  mentioned  task aversiveness,  task  difficulty  (Hebing  2016)  and  peer  effects  (e.g.  wrong role models) (cf. Nordby et al. 2017). In our study (Imhof et al. 2021), one of the  strongest  predictors  of  delay  was  the  type  of  deadline,  specifically whether the deadline was communicated (i.e. a specific day and time were indicated  on  Moodle)  or  left  vague  (i.e.  only  a  relative  deadline  was provided,  such  as  'two  weeks  after  the  next  face-to-face  lesson').  The assignments with clear deadlines were far less likely to be delayed than the more vaguely defined deadlines. Assignments with unclear deadlines may be perceived as more distant than they actually are, which reduces the perceived urgency to complete them and thus increases the probability of delay (Huang et al. 2021).

## Conceptual framework

This  section  provides  more  details  about  the  conceptual  framework, particularly the adaptive model, and what kinds of interventions could be provided, again in general and explicitly targeting our programming use case .  We discuss which interventions are particularly suitable for addressing specific  reasons  for  procrastination  and  what  role  SDL  plays  in  the intervention  approaches.  We  also  briefly  touch  upon  the  distinction between  fully  automated  and  semi-automated  interventions,  and  the implications of these interventions for educators and students.

Our  conceptual  framework  could  be  automated  within  an  LMS  by implementing an adaptive learning system consisting of three components: the domain model, the learner model and the adaptive model (Vagale &amp; Niedrite  2012). Adaptive  learning systems are  technical  solutions  that allow  learning  content  and  presentation  modes  to  be  adapted  to  the needs of individual students (Adams Becker et al. 2018; Imhof et al. 2020). As these systems allow for more flexibility than other approaches, they have the potential to foster SDL (cf. Zainuddin &amp; Perera 2018). Instead of providing  all  students  with  the  same  content  or  presentation  mode,

adaptive systems identify specific  characteristics  of  individual  students and their needs and react accordingly by changing aspects of the learning experience  on  the  platform.  This  adaptation  is  achieved  by  having  the three  components interact:  the  learner  model  represents  each  student, assesses pre-defined traits via sensors and then processes the data via the so-called learner modeller. These traits could include abilities, knowledge (e.g. based on test or quiz scores), personality traits (e.g. diligence based on log data) or preferences (e.g. based on click distributions). The domain model  contains  the  learning  content  of  the  course  and  details  how  it is  structured  (e.g.  how  different  tasks  and  files  are  connected),  as  well as  what  the  intended  learning  outcomes  are.  The  domain  model  also details  the  granularity  of  the  adaptation,  meaning  the  level  at  which adaptations  are  supposed  to  happen  (on  a  step  level,  task  level  or curriculum level). The third model (the adaptive model) absorbs information  from  both  of  the  other  models  and  decides  if  and  how  to adapt the objects of adaptation, based on whether certain conditions are met. These objects can be the content, instructions, mode of presentation, learning paths or, in our case, interventions.

If applied to our use case , the procedure could be (see Figure 5.1):

- · Step 1: Firstly, the learner model sensors assess the SDL level for the individual student, based on questionnaire scores (as explained in the previous  section).  Measuring  SDL  is  crucial,  as  being  self-directed  is essential for success in an adaptive learning system (Forsyth et al. 2019). Our proposed approach involves a concise SDL scale, such as the SDLS, to prevent students from becoming disengaged because of the extensive use of questionnaires. In combination with log data, which could also be derived from historical data from previous semesters, a representation of the student is created if available.
- · Step 2: Based on ML algorithms, as will be explained in the following section, the system then automatically predicts the probability of each student delaying the submission of their next programming tasks, which is also entered into the learner model as an additional facet. Ideally, this will include contextual data to indicate the likely reason for procrastinating, e.g., fear of failure, as this has implications for subsequent interventions.
- · Step 3: Once enough information is collected, the system will provide an intervention that could be fully automated or semi-automated.
- · Step 4: After receiving the intervention, the system will measure SDL again  and  then  update  the  learner  model.  If  the  interventions  are successful, SDL should be improved compared to the first measurement taken in step 1. As this entails multiple rounds of SDL measurements, short questionnaires are advisable, as noted before.

- · Step 5: Procrastination (or delay) will then be measured, e.g., by assessing whether students delay their programming tasks. Dilatory behaviour is expected  to  be  reduced,  which  increases  the  chances  of  academic success.
- · Step  6:  The  adaptive  model  will  decide  if  another  intervention  is necessary and continue the cycle by starting with step 1 again.

As indicated in the previous section, this framework rests on a theoretical foundation. Adaptive learning environments have previously successfully been  used  in  computer  science  (Gasparinatou  &amp;  Grigoriadou  2015) and  programming  courses  (Ling  &amp;  Chiang  2022;  Troussas,  Krouska  &amp; Sgouropoulou 2020), but there is also some mixed evidence.

and  Pate  (2021),  for  instance,  investigated  the  effects  of  an  adaptive learning system on SDL in the context of pharmaceutical education and found that time management and procrastination actually worsened after the introduction of that system. The authors note that careful consideration needs to be given to training and supporting students so they become more proficient in their SDL skills.

In terms of intervention strategies for procrastination, Van Eerde and Klingsieck (2018) conducted a meta-analysis and analysed the results of 24  studies  following  four  different  approaches:  self-regulatory  skills (e.g.  time  management);  cognitive  behavioural  therapy  (CBT);  other therapeutic  approaches;  and  resource-based  interventions.  Cognitive behavioural therapy-based interventions yielded the best effect, which is thought to be an effect of the intensity of this type of intervention, i.e., a therapeutic  approach.  Notably,  the  meta-analysis  also  revealed  that improving time management skills alone may not be enough to overcome procrastination,  as  this  approach  alone  fails  to  address  underlying emotional issues, such as fear of failure, which may be a critical driving force of procrastination for a substantial number of students, especially in a programming course. Despite being successful, these interventions have many drawbacks. They are intense, time-consuming and beyond the skillset of most educators, so applying them to DE (e.g. adaptive learning systems) is an additional challenge that should not be ignored. Furthermore,  intentions  often  fail  to  translate  into  actual  behaviour, especially when tempting alternatives (such as social media access) are present, or students fall into habits (Hen &amp; Goroshit 2020), which is a common issue in procrastination.

As the choice of intervention should depend on the reasons behind the behaviour and the type of delay (Van Eerde &amp; Klingsieck 2018), intervention approaches should rely on more than one strategy. Students who delay tasks,  because  they  are  afraid  of  them,  might  benefit  from  psychoeducational measures,  e.g.,  by  giving  them  helpful  information  about  how  to  fight programming anxiety and increase their self-efficacy. While psychoeducation is often a part of psychotherapy, it can also be provided as an online selfhelp intervention. For instance, Brog et al. (2022) recently investigated the effectiveness of ROCO (resilience and optimism during COVID-19), which is an intervention that is aimed at reducing psychological distress experienced during  the  recent  pandemic.  The  intervention  consisted  of  six  thematic modules,  each  containing  brief  texts,  videos,  illustrations,  exercises  and weekly tasks that address emotion regulation skills. While the intervention did  not  reduce  symptoms  of  depression  successfully,  it  did  lead  to  a significant  increase  in  emotion  regulation  skills  and  resilience.  A  similar intervention could benefit SDL and procrastination, as emotion regulation is  a  key  element  of  self-regulatory  failure  (Wagner  &amp;  Heatherton  2014).

By increasing emotion regulation, which is a type of self-regulation, the negative impact of emotions on the learning process could be prevented, which  would  affect  SDL  and  procrastination  positively  (cf.  Peistaraite  &amp; Clark  2020,  who  found  a  positive  effect  on  a  similar  learning  concept, namely, self-regulated learning [SRL]).

Students with suboptimal time management skills (and thus a lack of SDL skills) may appreciate a prompting system, e.g., a system that reminds them that they have not coded in a while or that a deadline for an upcoming assignment is approaching. Programming anxiety can be counteracted by providing students with a countdown timer, which increases the sense of urgency and focus on the task at hand, and this has reportedly influenced students, according to other researchers (Aban &amp; Fontanil 2015; Olipas &amp; Luciano 2020). Introducing such a timer is also a viable strategy from an SDL  perspective,  as  an  acute  awareness  of  a  tight  schedule  requires students to self-monitor more and to utilise appropriate, efficient strategies to solve the task promptly. A different approach was followed by Shaffer and Kazerouni (2021),  who  conducted  a  quasi-experiment  wherein  they investigated  the  effect  of  a  milestone-based  treatment  on  project  and course outcomes in a Java course. They found that students in the treatment group, who were tasked with completing four milestones with deadlines set by the course instructor, procrastinated less and achieved better results than their peers in the control group that had no such milestones. Shaffer and Kazerouni (2021) then argued that segmenting an immense task into more manageable chunks should reduce the many self-regulatory issues that programming novices face.

Another promising strategy is to implement gamification elements in non-gaming environments. In a recent study, Palaniappan and Noor (2022) introduced gamification elements into a Python programming course on Moodle by awarding badges and displaying rankings on a leaderboard. As their  results  show,  this  intervention  had  a  positive  impact  on  students' academic performance and their level of self-directedness. Selfmanagement,  motivation  and  self-monitoring  all  increased  after  the intervention.  Neumann  et  al.  (2021)  presented  an  additional  intriguing approach  using  chatbots  to  support  self-study,  with  promising  results having been obtained.

Some students may engage in procrastination because of their aversion to specific tasks. However, these students may be more motivated if they are presented with the same assignment in an alternative format or if the task  is  contextualised  in  a  way  that  aligns  with  their  preferences  or experiences (see Van Vorst &amp; Aydogmus 2021). For example, a programming assignment could be reframed to match the student's interests. Adapting these  elements  to  the  preferences  of  individual  students  is  possible  in

adaptive  learning  systems,  but  this  requires  the  selection  of  relevant student characteristics for the learner model and additional effort in terms of instructional design, as many different versions of the same task would have  to  be  designed.  Evidence  suggests  that  providing  content  on  an adaptive  learning  system  can  foster  SDL  on  its  own,  without  further interventions  (e.g.  Toth  et  al.  2021).  Despite  the  negative  impact  on procrastination  as  outlined  above,  Toth  et  al.  (2021)  found  that  some students'  SDL  scores  improved  after  implementing  an  adaptive  system. Although the authors could not conclude that introducing the adaptive system improved SDL overall, they found positive effects for some factors, such as improved examination and stress management.

Another way to foster SDL in an adaptive learning system is via adaptive scaffolding,  which  has  been  proposed  to  support  students  who  may struggle with the metacognitive demands of SDL. After all, thinking about their learning strategies, planning ahead, processing incoming information, adjusting their approaches and monitoring their progress may  be overwhelming to some students. The idea behind scaffolding is to provide support  that  will  gradually  fade  away  as  the  students'  competencies increase (cf. Noroozi et al. 2018). For example, Ley, Kump and Gerdenitsch (2010) developed a system that recommended various learning goals to their students in three conditions. In the fixed scaffolding condition, the goals were retrieved from the domain model; in the personalised scaffolding condition,  the  recommendations  were  ranked  according  to  the  learner model; and in the control condition, the learning goals were recommended randomly.  Their  results  showed  that  students  in  either  experimental condition performed better than those in the control condition and reported that they felt more supported.

These interventions do not have to be forced on every student; instead, they could be offered as suggestions or recommendations. The flexibility that adaptive systems grant educators also aligns with one of the major tenets  of  SDL,  namely,  letting  students  take  charge  of  their  learning progress. This is crucial in order not to alienate students and to account for false predictions that can result. As pointed out, strategic delayers do not need interventions and might perform worse if provided with too much unnecessary information. This highlights the need for accurate predictions within  the  adaptive  system,  which  increases  trust  among  students  and educators. As highlighted by researchers, trust, acceptance and understandability of the mechanisms behind adaptive learning systems are essential  for  developing  these  systems  further  and  adopting  them  in educational contexts (Alamri et al. 2019; Cavanagh et al. 2020).

A related point of discussion with educational implications is whether the intervention should be provided semi-automated or fully automated.

A  fully  automated  intervention  means  that  no  input  from  educators  is needed. Instead, the adaptive system autonomously provides interventions, e.g.,  prompts, recommendations, personalised instructions and scaffolding. However, this does not imply that educators have no way of intervening. They would still be able to monitor the provision of interventions and step in if necessary. While full automation has not yet been implemented in any scalable  capacity  in  the  field,  it  might  be  an  exciting  prospect  in  the coming years.

The main issue is again the high level of accuracy that this endeavour would require and perhaps also a lack of trust among students. Educators might also fear they are being replaced, which should be avoided. With a semi-automated system, the educator would still play a significant role by being notified of the system's prediction, upon which they could decide to act. In this case, the educator acts as a mediator between the system and the student, which mitigates the risk of wrong predictions interfering with the student's learning process. It is also debatable whether a false positive (falsely warning a student about their predicted delay) or a false negative (not warning a student about delaying their assignment) is worse, which has implications for the adaptive model. Depending on which of the two errors  is  considered  more  harmful,  the  model  will  be  cautious  with  its predictions.

## Prediction models

As  our  framework  aims  to  provide  SDL-based  interventions  (such  as prompts,  scaffolding,  reframed  tasks,  psychoeducational  elements  and recommendations, as outlined above) on an LMS, specifically as part of an adaptive system, we must rely on accurate predictions to ascertain whether students require intervention. After all, many students do not procrastinate or delay tasks strategically and productively, e.g., because they prefer to work under time pressure (Klingsieck 2013). Providing these students with the same SDL-based interventions as actual procrastinators could prove counterproductive, as it may alienate them or increase their cognitive load unnecessarily.  As  strategic  delayers  are  successful  in  their  endeavours (Klingsieck 2013), there is little need for any intervention in the first place. For this reason, our approach needs appropriate ML models that can deliver accurate predictions in a scalable and efficient manner, preferably in realtime.  This  section  explores  the  prerequisites,  characteristics,  merits  and drawbacks of these ML models.

To  determine  what  models  could  be  implemented  to  predict  dilatory behaviour, we conducted a study (Imhof et al. 2022) in which we compared the predictive performance of multiple ML models based on data collected during another procrastination study (Imhof et al. 2021). The aim was to

determine the algorithms that yielded minimal errors between the values for predicted and actual delays in submitting mandatory online assignments. The  delay  was  operationalised  as  the  temporal  difference  between  the submission of an assignment and the deadline, as defined by the educators or course developers. As we used both objective and subjective predictors, we  ended  up  comparing  our  selection  of  ML  algorithms  (Naïve  Bayes, K-Nearest  Neighbours,  Radial  Basis  Function  Networks,  Feed-Forward Neural Networks, Regression Trees, Gradient Boosting Machines, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, Bayesian multilevel models as a baseline) for different sets of predictors: only subjective predictors (i.e. questionnaire scores), only objective predictors (i.e. log data indicators) and all predictors combined. Procrastination (trait), strategic delay (trait), general academic self-efficacy and SDL were each assessed with a short questionnaire: the Academic Procrastination Scale - Short Form (APS-S) (McCloskey 2012), the APS (Choi &amp; Moran 2009), the general academic self-efficacy scale (GASE) (Nielsen et al. 2018) and the SDLS (Lounsbury et al. 2009), respectively. The objective predictors were the number of clicks on the assignment, the number of clicks on relevant course activities and the interval between the start of a block and the first click on the assignment.

The  results  revealed  a  different  'winner'  in  each  category:  Gradient Boosting Machines emerged as the best model for the subjective data; for the  objective  data,  it  was  the  Bayesian  multilevel  models  with  random slopes; and for the combined data, Random Forests was the most successful algorithm. These results imply that multiple algorithms should be considered when predicting delay, rather than using the same model for different kinds of  data.  Assuming  that  the  data  for  predicting  dilatory  behaviour  are collected accurately, the performance of ML algorithms depends on various circumstances, such as data size, the number of predictors and intervention time. Data size refers to the data collected from the participants, in our case, students. If the data set is large enough, the ML algorithms can make more appropriate correlations between the student input data, the type of dilatory behaviour to be predicted and the interventions to be provided. If the data set  is  small,  ML  models  may  over-fit  the  existing  data  and  provide  poor predictive performance when new data are collected. A conclusive example in this sense is neural networks, which are known for their high predictive performance when the amount of data are large enough. When the collected data are small, these models provide inaccurate predictions compared to other models, as we observed in our previous study (Imhof et al. 2022).

The number of predictors (data dimensions) depends on the subjective and  objective  variables  observed  and  collected  from  the  students.  The subjective predictors are questionnaire-related data collected from students  at  the  beginning  of  the  semester.  Some  subjective  predictors might  be  updated  occasionally,  as  some  questionnaires  are  repeated.

However,  the  number  of  subjective  predictors  in  combination  with  the objective predictors plays a vital role in predictive performance. Support vector machines are generally considered the most accurate ML models, but are computationally expensive when the data dimension is high in most prediction tasks. In our study, support vector machines provided outstanding  prediction  performance  when  combining  subjective  and objective  data  sets,  but  without  being  the  best  option  for  any  of  these cases. However, in the proposed framework, special attention should be paid to the computational complexity of the ML algorithms, as both the data size and the data dimension are higher than in our previous study, and the data are collected in different iterations during the semester, as shown in Figure 5.1.

Another important aspect related to the prediction performance of the dilatory behaviour is determining the optimal time for the intervention during the semester. As we observed in our previous study, the prediction performance increases when more data (especially objective data) are considered in calculating the predictions. This is in line with the results of Xing  and  Du  (2019),  who  found  an  increase  in  predictive  performance when  predicting  dropouts  in  MOOCs  (Massive  Open  Online  Courses). Therefore,  in  the  proposed  framework,  we  expect  the  same  trend  of performance increase as the data are accumulated over time. However, the  optimal  intervention  time  should  be  chosen  so  that  the  prediction performance of the ML models is high enough. This aspect is crucial for training the ML models because once the intervention is performed, the data subsequently collected are biased; therefore, it cannot be used to train the models further and improve their predictive performance. Two distinct phases are considered in the data collection process to maximise the benefit of the proposed framework. In the first phase, subjective and objective  data  are  collected  without  intervention.  These  data  are  used exclusively  to train and  test  the  ML  models.  Once  the  predictive performance stabilises without significant fluctuation as more data are collected, the ML model is successfully trained and can be used in the second phase. In this second phase, the predictions provided by the ML model will form the basis for intervention in each iteration, and the impact on SDL and procrastination can be further investigated.

## Conclusion

We conclude this chapter with an outlook on future research that will be necessary to lay the foundation for implementing our conceptual framework in the field, which will assist students in reducing their maladaptive dilatory tendencies. Before our framework can be applied and in-depth applicationoriented research can be conducted, several fundamental questions and

issues must first be addressed. For instance, there is a need for adaptive learning systems with a learner model that involves a more extensive variety of aspects of the students. To date, motivational factors and metacognitive abilities have rarely been used to inform learner models (Nakić, Granić &amp; Glavinić 2015), and to the best of our knowledge, no adaptive system in the literature  has  involved  SDL  as  part  of  its  learner  model.  A  recent  study performed by Harati et al. (2021) investigated a system that incorporates a similar learning concept, SRL - cf. Linkous (2021) for an in-depth discussion about the differences between SDL and SRL.

Another  issue  is  the  viability  of  assessing  learning-relevant  concepts such as SDL, self-efficacy, self-regulation and monitoring with log data and context  data  alone.  For  the  adaptive  process  to  be  as  non-intrusive  as possible,  these  concepts  should  ideally  be  assessed  without  relying  on lengthy questionnaires. However, more research is necessary to find valid log data-based indicators of these learning-relevant concepts. The same goes for contextual data to identify the likely reason for dilatory behaviour. An  intervention  targeting  fear  of  failure  requires  verification  regarding whether  students  are  delaying  their  tasks  for  that  reason,  for  instance. Another open question is which of the presented intervention techniques should be included in an adaptive system, which requires more empirical data about the effectiveness and acceptance of these approaches. How to provide them in a semi-automated manner also requires further research.

This chapter presents a proposed conceptual framework for an adaptive system that is based on SDL designed to combat academic procrastination, with  various  potential  intervention  strategies  that  target  procrastination and its  causes  by  promoting  SDL  skills.  While  much  progress  has  been made as far as individual components of this framework are concerned, there is still a need for more research before the system can be implemented in  the  field  to  foster  students'  SDL  skills  and  reduce  their  maladaptive dilatory tendencies, and reduce the risk of dropping out and other negative consequences.

In conclusion, the important part of SDL in addressing procrastination within higher DE has been evident in its positive influence on academic success. Encouraging an active and positive approach to learning provides students with the needed skills to steer the encounters of remote education successfully. As we shift to the next chapter, we will investigate the space of  continuous  professional  development,  exploring  how  SDL  between lecturers contributes to curriculum transformation.

## Abstract

Curriculum transformation is often seen as complex and difficult, leaving lecturers frustrated and perplexed. A lecturer's own perceptions and skills to  engage  with  curriculum  transformation  and  pedagogical  decisions might be to blame for curricula that are unable to address the needs of industry,  respond  to  societal  challenges,  or  equip  skilled  workers  to contribute to the economy. This chapter (1) explores how the curriculum can be unpacked to improve curriculum contextualisation, (2) highlights student-centred practices linked to the inclusion of self-directed learning (SDL) in the curriculum and (3) discusses the need to improve continuous professional  development  (CPD)  for  lecturers  to  enhance  curriculum transformation.

## Introduction

Curriculum  transformation  is  frequently  perceived  as  challenging  and intricate in South African and international higher education (HE) contexts (Slabbert-Redpath 2022). Curriculum transformation is often intertwined with social, political, historical or cultural factors and issues of marginalisation. Diverse perspectives and interpretations of what transformation  entails  further  complicate  the  agenda.  Additionally,  the concept of the curriculum is rarely straightforward or unbiased.

It is evident from  experience  and  data  collected  that  lecturers' understanding of the curriculum influences their decisions to change the curriculum and how they engage with teaching, learning and assessment (TLA) or implement student-centred practices and self-directed learning (SDL)  strategies.  Lecturers'  understanding  and  contextualisation  of  the curriculum also influence their professional development practice, linked to their contribution to the scholarship of curriculum practices (SoCP) and the scholarship of teaching and learning (SoTL). The introduction to SoCP and SoTL originates from continuous professional development (CPD).

Continuous  professional  development  is  currently  on  the  agenda  for most higher education institutions (HEIs) in the global HE landscape. The shift to remote online TLA, because of the COVID-19 pandemic, exposed the  gaps,  needs  and  strengths  of  CPD  programmes,  specifically  with  a stronger focus on SDL practices for lecturers in their learning environments and  curriculum.  Continuous  professional  development  is  essential  for lecturers,  as  the  ever-evolving  HE  environment  demands  they  remain updated and embrace lifelong learning (Engin &amp; Atkinson 2015). Maphosa, Mudzielwana  and  Netshifhefhe  (2014)  argue  that  university  lecturers cannot  effectively  manage  critical  tasks  like  curriculum  planning  and

development  related  to  curriculum  transformation  without  appropriate training and the necessary knowledge and skills.

The  curriculum  transformation  process  involves  embedding  subjectspecific knowledge and skills in teaching and learning practices through SDL  practices  and  CPD.  Lecturers  are  the  key  role  players  in  the  HE context and have to fulfil multiple roles, such as the lecturer (mediator of students' learning through fostering SDL practices) and lifelong learner (responsible  for  own  learning  using  CPD).  Incorporating  pedagogical principles into CPD programmes (cf. Chapter 4) can help lecturers develop the  skills  and  mindset  needed  to  create  a  learning  environment  that promotes self-direction, autonomy, critical thinking and lifelong learning among  students.  This  approach  aligns  with  the  goals  of  curriculum transformation by fostering more adaptive, responsive, inclusive and selfdirected curricula.

However, when lecturers face a change of curriculum, they are often confronted with a lack of understanding of how to adapt their curricula and the parameters of what they can change in the curriculum. One way to improve  lecturers'  knowledge,  competencies  and  skills  is  through  CPD practices  focusing  on  curriculum  transformation  with  SDL.  Self-directed learning emphasises the development of the capability to learn autonomously. In the context of curriculum transformation, SDL supports the idea that students and lecturers should be empowered to take control and accountability of their learning processes.

When lecturers take control of their own learning (through SDL), they will employ SDL skills such as self-reflection, self-determination, motivation, self-regulation, perseverance, adaptability, resilience, capability development, metacognition, confidence and student-centredness in their curricula. Guglielmino (2013) highlights that a student-oriented curriculum fosters  SDL,  equipping  students  with  the  SDL  skills  to  acquire  new information  readily  and  competently  throughout  their  lives.  Techniques such as using diverse teaching and learning tools, enhancing peer learning activities  and  creating  a  positive  learning  environment  contribute  to meaningful student engagement and learning. One avenue of incorporating SDL and student-centredness into curricula is contextualising the curriculum (Du Toit-Brits 2018).

When lecturers decontextualise their curricula, they play a crucial role as change agents of SDL (Du Toit-Brits 2018). Incentives, time agreements and CPD investment should support curriculum transformation. The SoCP can  enhance  HEIs'  involvement  in  curriculum  transformation  research, communities of practice (CoP) and SoTL initiatives.

While  it  is  true  that  HEIs  offer  CPD  opportunities  linked  to  facets  of curriculum transformation, there is a palpable need to devise purposeful and dedicated initiatives. These initiatives should be explicitly designed to enhance the competencies of lecturers and support staff, enabling them to actively participate in curriculum transformation efforts, such as studentcentredness  and  SDL,  to  address  and  overcome  barriers  to  curriculum transformation effectively.

As documented in the literature, various barriers hinder the progress of curriculum transformation. These barriers encompass a range of challenges. Firstly, the sheer volume of students observed by Ishmail in 2004 can exert significant pressure on the transformation process. Moreover, as identified by  Ishmail  (2004)  and  Powell  (2010),  low  morale  represents  a  critical barrier to the transformation agenda. Another challenge lies in teaching within multicultural classrooms, which inherently demands  nuanced instructional approaches.

Moreover, the shortage of CPD opportunities and staff upskilling (Ishmail 2004) are recognised as obstacles to curriculum transformation. Additionally,  lecturers'  unfamiliarity  with  current  trends,  methods  and developments can cause anxiety and reluctance, prompting them to defend their existing curricula and remain within their comfort zones (Powell 2010). Other factors affecting curriculum transformation include the absence of a research-focused orientation, significantly impacting the process (Powell 2010). The presence of imbalances in power distribution among staff, as articulated by Vorster (2010), and within organisational structure, as noted by  Dirk  (2013),  also  contributes  to  the  complexities  associated  with curriculum transformation. These power dynamics hinder effective communication and collaboration, thereby perpetuating systemic barriers to change.

This chapter aims to clarify how the curriculum can be unpacked and demystified  to  improve  curriculum  contextualisation  (linked  to  barriers impacting curriculum transformation), highlighting student-centred pedagogy and heutagogy related to the inclusion of SDL in the curriculum. This may improve the CPD of academic staff and SoCP and SoTL outputs. The  following  section  explains  this chapter's theoretical framework, methodology and data analysis.

## Theoretical framework, methodology and data analysis

The  theoretical  foundation  that  underpins  this  chapter  rests  on  the framework of social  constructivism,  with  a  specific  focus  on  Vygotsky's (1987)  insights.  Central  to  our  discussion  is  Vygotsky's  construct  of  the

'zone of proximal development' (ZPD) and its implications for scaffolding student learning. We employ these ideas to elucidate how the curriculum can  often  harbour  concealed  and  inadvertent  connections  within  the context and delivery of TLA. As articulated in 1987, Vygotsky's argument posits  that  the  curriculum  can  facilitate  and  augment  student  learning across the ZPD as students traverse the spectrum from actual to potential development. The ZPD provided a framework for examining the existing curriculum and exploring the potential for its transformation. By employing cultural-historical  activity  theory  (CHAT)  alongside  the  ZPD,  we  could delve  into  the  intricate  and  often  contentious  concept  of  curriculum transformation and SDL.

HE landscapes involve diverse stakeholders within HEIs, nationally and internationally, in curriculum transformation. Our chapter presents findings from a systematic review of public curriculum documents and data from lecturer  questionnaires  and  interviews.  We  utilised  CHAT  for  analysis, importing all data into Atlas.ti for coding and network diagram creation. Following activity theory principles, we summarised results using tables and CHAT diagrams. This chapter elaborates on triangulated findings and suggests improvements for CPD to impact SDL and curriculum transformation in HE. A brief concept clarification is provided to guide our arguments.

## Unpacking the curriculum

The notion of curriculum is often contested, as various schools of thought regarding  what  the  idea  implies.  In  Le  Grange's  2019  discourse,  the curriculum is described as a multifaceted construct, meaning it is shaped by context, historical periods and foundational philosophical paradigms. Le Grange  (2019)  advances  the  proposition  that  the  curriculum  intricately connects the delineation of the content and what and whose knowledge is encompassed therein.

In an academic context, the concept curriculum embodies an array of knowledge, ranging from subject lists, topics and resources integrated into a course of study to teaching methodologies, assessment practices, skills, values and pedagogy. Curricula are influenced by several factors, including the nature of the discipline or field, the curriculum designer's philosophical beliefs, the students' characteristics and the broader educational context in which it is implemented. A curriculum encompasses the entire educational experience, from the meticulously planned processes to the actual teaching and students' personal experiences during learning. It also acknowledges the 'hidden curriculum', which includes the unwritten, unofficial and often unintended lessons, values and perspectives that a curriculum implicitly

conveys  and  embodies  (Council  for  Higher  Education  [CHE]  2021).  Our view  on  curriculum  aligns  closely  with  the  principles  articulated  by  the CHE.

The curriculum can be understood as the layers or levels at which various role players engage with the curriculum that is context-bound or contextspecific.  Van  den  Akker  (2004)  delineates  the  distinct  layers  of  the curriculum, which unfold hierarchically. These layers begin at the overarching and most pivotal level, followed by the curriculum's macro, meso, micro and nano levels. Precisely defining these layers is far from straightforward because  of  the  intricate  and  ever-evolving  nature  of  the  curriculum's constituent elements. Curriculum development is inherently non-linear and inherently social. The process of shaping the curriculum takes on various forms across different levels, as highlighted by Van den Akker (2004, 2006) (also see Figure 6.1 and Table 6.1):

- · Macro  -  transnational  ideas  or  international  comparative  level;  and national  level,  including  policy  intentions,  national  systems  or  core national objectives.
- · Meso - policy guidance at an institution or institution-specific level.
- · Micro - classroom-level curricular practices level.
- · Nano - personal and individual level.

Figure 6.1 clarifies the various layers of the HE curriculum, contextualised using Rogoff's (1995a, 1995b) planes, and highlights the critical participants involved at each level.

To use Rogoff (1995a, 1995b), at an interpersonal level, one needs to use humans (persons), such as the lecturer or students, as the subject of an activity system and compare or juxtapose two activity systems with the two human subjects in each activity system. However, the chapter focused on lecturers' perceptions, and we only collected data from lecturers. Therefore, using the interpersonal plane in the chapter was impossible.

## Curriculum transformation to contextualise the curriculum

Understanding curriculum transformation and contextualisation is crucial before unpacking SDL. Curriculum transformation involves rethinking and redesigning the curriculum to meet current and future educational needs, ensuring it is relevant, self-directed and effective. By understanding this, lecturers can ensure that SDL strategies are aligned with the overall goals of the transformed curriculum, promoting coherence and consistency in educational delivery.

Contextualisation involves adapting the curriculum to make it relevant to  the  specific  context  in  which  it  is  being  taught,  considering  cultural, social, local as well as learning needs. Contextualisation ensures that SDL applies  to  the  students'  backgrounds,  experiences  and  needs,  making learning more meaningful and engaging. Contextualisation also links to the development of appropriate learning strategies; facilitates student autonomy,  engagement  and  motivation;  ensures  inclusivity  and  equity; strengthens critical thinking, problem-solving and SDL skills; and integrates technology  and  modern  resources,  highlighting  the  needs  for  CPD  for lecturers.

A brief discussion of curriculum transformation and curriculum contextualisation will follow.

## Curriculum transformation

To  understand  curriculum  transformation,  we  must  first  examine  what transformation means. Du Preez, Simmonds and Verhoef (2016, p. 2) state that  the  Greek  term  for  transformation, metaschimatismos ,  highlights  a change in form and encompasses ideas of remodelling, modification and restructuring.  The  term  'transformation'  itself  is  complex  and  open  to interpretation, but it fundamentally means 'to undergo and cause a change of form'. In HE, transformation can be understood as:

…  part  of  the  broader  process  of  South  Africa's  political,  social  and economic  transition,  which  includes  political  democratisation,  economic reconstruction  and  development,  and  redistributive  social  policies  aimed at  equity  and  a  necessity,  not  an  option,  in  the  South  African  context. (Du Preez et al. 2016, p. 2)

Transformation in South African HEIs involves more than just altering the composition of staff and students or changing governance structures and curricula. It also requires transforming organisational culture and fostering the development  and  acceptance  of  new  and  shared  values.  Such transformation necessitates a change in mindset among all participants in the  diverse  nation  to  ensure  quality,  success  and  access  to  academic opportunities (Fourie 1999). According to the CHE (2013), a transformed HE  system  would  support  an  emerging,  non-racial  and  progressive democracy by producing critical, independent citizens and skilled, socially committed  graduates  who  can  contribute to social and economic development.

Curriculum transformation in HE is a deliberate process where current curricula are modified to incorporate the values, goals and aims of HEIs. In South Africa, this transformation is influenced by institutional objectives, industry demands and social justice issues, including decolonisation and Africanisation.  It  also  addresses  responsiveness  to  social  context  and epistemological diversity and improvements in pedagogy, student retention and success (Badat 2010; Ramrathan 2016; Soudien 2010).

Furthermore,  Jansen  (2017)  explains  that  curriculum  transformation deeply affects the identity of a HEI by raising challenging questions about its self-perception in relation to the nation and the world. Jansen adds that the university curriculum becomes a focal point because it holds symbolic value far beyond its practical functions, such as subject content selection, teaching  methods  and  learning  acquisition.  The  curriculum  embodies values, commitments and ideals, with those in power determining what is deemed  worth  teaching  and  learning,  whether  implicitly  or  explicitly. Curriculum transformation is also known as curriculum reform, renewal or change  in  the  literature.  These  changes  or  reforms  should  address  and respond to 'wicked problems' and societal issues (Rittel &amp; Webber 1973).

A core function of universities can be described as a central and essential part of the local community involved in regional development and local economic growth and plays a robust vocational role in society to address societal  issues  (Moscardini,  Strachan  &amp;  Vlasova  2022)  and  the  national transformation agenda. In South Africa, numerous policies and guidelines guide  transformation  and  curriculum  changes  in  HE.  The  government establishes  the  transformation  agenda  and  compliance  requirements through entities like the DHET, CHE and SAQA (South African Qualifications Authority) (Menon &amp; Castrillon 2019). This compliance focuses on technical aspects such as credits, notional hours, articulation options, NQF (National Qualifications  Framework)  levels,  level  descriptors,  learning  outcomes, assessment  criteria,  module  types  and  learning  activities.  Menon  and

Castrillon (2019, p. 31) argue that the curriculum has become 'an aggregation of  complexity  assessment'  involving  elements  like  NQF  levels,  module outcomes,  the  volume  of  learning  and  teaching  credits,  weighting  and activities.  They  highlight  that  external  initiatives  shape  the  language  of curriculum design and planning. The curriculum is viewed as performative, which is challenging to measure. The regulatory and compliance language becomes the standard for gauging curriculum transformation, leaving the actual and hidden curriculum unassessed. In internal and external programme  evaluations  (IPE/EPE),  curriculum  reviewers  rarely  evaluate curriculum transformation and SDL skills, and there is little consensus on what this evaluation should entail or imply (Menon &amp; Castrillon 2019). The lack of a shared understanding of what curriculum transformation entails in the HE landscape is problematic and does not assist lecturers in engaging with curriculum transformation implementation.

The most direct connection to implementing curriculum transformation in  current  HEI  programmes  is  found  in  existing  programmes'  IPE/EPE, which use the CHE's programme accreditation criteria. Menon and Castrillon (2019) emphasise that the South African HE landscapes lack monitoring and  evaluating  curriculum  and  transformation.  Ensuring  the  quality  of curriculum transformation is primarily embedded within the structures of each  HEI,  with  minimal  guidance  on  the  specifics  of  'how'  and  'what' curriculum transformation should involve in South African universities.

The South African university has retained its traditional British university structure for 28 years after apartheid. The curriculum, rooted in Eurocentric knowledge,  is  pivotal  to  addressing  social  and  educational  challenges, emphasising access, epistemological access, responsiveness and equity in national HE transformation debates. There has been a lack of significant changes to the South African HE curricula over the past century, resembling characteristics  observed  in  colonial-era  education  (Ramrathan  2016). Howson and Kingsbury (2021) characterise the curriculum as outdated and needing transformation. They describe curriculum reform as a contentious and  intricate  social  process  that  involves  individual,  disciplinary,  and institutional identities and mirrors the power dynamics within academia.

Disciplinary and institutional identities mirror the power dynamics within academia. The power dynamics in curriculum reform involve a shift from a top-down,  policy-driven  approach  to  a  bottom-up  one  that  emphasises understanding and enactment. Under a top-down approach to curriculum transformation, faculty often encounter discrepancies in perceptions and may not take ownership of or perceive the relevance of initiatives. Similarly, students  may  perceive  the  curriculum  as  top-down  when  they  lack opportunities  to  contribute  or  make  choices.  Fostering  a  self-directed

environment where faculty and students have a voice in the transformation process is essential to address these concerns. Curriculum transformation is crucial in linking SDL by shaping the HE environment and framework for students to thrive as self-directed individuals.

## Curriculum transformation connects with self-directed learning

Curriculum transformation connects with SDL through the following:

## Alignment of goals and aims

Curriculum transformation involves rethinking and redesigning the curriculum to meet current educational and societal needs and goals. When the curriculum is transformed to emphasise skills such as critical thinking, problem-solving and reflection, it inherently supports SDL. This alignment ensures that SDL activities are purposeful and integrated into the broader educational outcomes and aims.

## Fostering autonomy and responsibility

A  transformed  curriculum  often  encourages  students  to  take  more responsibility and  accountability  for  their  learning.  By  incorporating elements  that  promote  independent  learning,  such  as  project-based assignments, research opportunities and collaborative learning experiences, the  curriculum  transformation  nurtures  SDL  skills.  Students  learn  to  set goals, work  collaboratively, manage  their  time  effectively  and  seek resources autonomously.

## Promoting active engagement

Curriculum  transformation  can  shift  the  focus  from  passive  learning  to active  engagement.  Self-directed  learning  requires  students  to  seek knowledge actively, reflect on their learning process and apply what they have learned. A transformed curriculum typically includes interactive and participatory learning methods that encourage students to engage actively with course content, thus preparing them for SDL experiences.

## Emphasising lifelong learning skills

Self-directed learning is closely tied to the development of lifelong learning skills. A transformed curriculum often emphasises acquiring skills such as information literacy, critical thinking and adaptability, which are essential

for self-directed students. These skills enable students to continue learning beyond formal education and adapt to changing career and life circumstances.

## Supporting diverse learning pathways

Self-directed  learning  encourages  students  to  explore  topics  of  interest and choose their own learning pathways. A transformed curriculum can provide flexible learning opportunities, such as interdisciplinary modules and  courses,  elective  modules,  short  courses  (micro-credentials)  and student  choices  in  modules  that  cater  to  diverse  learner  interests  and needs. This flexibility allows students to be self-directed and to pursue SDL in areas that resonate with their passions and future career aspirations.

## Integrating technology and resources

Curriculum transformation often involves integrating modern technology and resources into the learning process. This integration supports SDL by providing  students  access  to  digital  tools,  online  databases,  multimedia resources and collaborative platforms that facilitate independent learning and research.

In  essence,  curriculum  transformation  creates  an  environment  that nurtures the skills, attitudes and behaviours conducive to SDL. By aligning educational outcomes, fostering autonomy, promoting active engagement, emphasising lifelong SDL skills, supporting diverse pathways and integrating technology, curriculum transformation lays a strong foundation for effective SDL practices among students and lecturers.

In  conclusion,  the  above-given  information  highlights  several  gaps concerning  curriculum  transformation  and  the  linkage  of  SDL  practices with curriculum transformation. Few studies explore the factors influencing curriculum - whether inhibiting or enabling - and the varying degrees of intensity of these changes (Anakin et al. 2018). Moreover, there is limited documentation on the processes that initiate curriculum changes at the university  level  across  institutions  (Anakin  et  al.  2018).  There  exists  a notable absence of consensus on key terminology related to curriculum transformation (Mendy &amp; Madiope 2020). Additionally, there is a shortage of guiding documents and frameworks guiding curriculum transformation in  HEIs  in  Southern  Africa.  Curriculum  transformation  is  depicted  as  a cyclical  institutional  process  (Howson  &amp;  Kinsbury  2021),  with  significant changes  often  characterised  as  resource-intensive  and  time-consuming, frequently  lacking comprehensive  evaluation.  This  complexity  leaves lecturers  uncertain  about  implementation  and  how  to  proceed  with contextualisation actions to enhance curriculum transformation.

## Curriculum contextualisation to enhance curriculum transformation

Contextualisation, as defined by the Cambridge Dictionary (2022), refers to the act or process of situating something within its context, considering the circumstances in which it exists or occurs. Curriculum contextualisation involves pedagogical strategies to enhance student success by adapting curriculum content to align more closely with the learning and teaching environment,  enhancing  comprehensibility  and  relevance  and  fostering SDL (Fernandes et al. 2013). According to Bernstein's pedagogic device (PD)  (2000),  curriculum  transformation  operates  within  the  field  of recontextualisation,  where  knowledge  sourced  from  various  contexts  is selected, reorganised and integrated into the curriculum (Shay 2016). The challenge  in  curriculum  reform  lies  in  navigating  the  underlying  logic, choices and principles governing this process (Bernstein 2000).

Pedagogy, andragogy and heutagogy represent different approaches to SDL  (cf.  Chapter  2  and  Chapter  4).  Pedagogy  traditionally  focuses  on teacher-directed  learning  for  children,  where  the  teacher  designs  and controls the learning process. Andragogy shifts the focus to adult learners, emphasising  their  need  for  self-direction, practical experiences  and problem-solving  skills.  Heutagogy  extends  this  by  promoting  learner autonomy and capability, encouraging individuals to determine their own learning  paths,  reflect  critically  and  adapt  to  new  situations.  Together, these frameworks highlight the evolution from dependent to increasingly self-directed and autonomous learning across different stages of development and contexts. This chapter uses pedagogy and heutagogy interchangeably as many educational authors, such as Bernstein (2000), Jansen (2009) and Le Grange (2011a), in literature use the term pedagogy when they refer to the methods and practices of teaching and learning aimed at improving and adapting the curriculum to meet student needs and  societal  demands  better.  Pedagogy  encompasses  student-centred learning, which emphasises active engagement, collaboration and critical thinking, and employs innovative teaching methods such as technologyenhanced tools, flipped classrooms and experiential learning. It promotes interdisciplinary  approaches,  inclusivity  and  accessibility  by  integrating diverse  fields  of  study  and  implementing  universal  design  for  learning principles.  Assessment  and  feedback  are  crucial,  utilising  formative  and summative assessments to measure learning and provide ongoing feedback, while faculty development and support ensure growth and the sharing  of  best  practices.  Curriculum  alignment  with  current  research, industry demands and societal needs ensures relevance and applicability, involving  stakeholders  in  the  development  process.  Reflective  practice encourages lecturers to continuously improve their methods and

understand the impact on student learning, fostering a culture of continuous improvement and innovation to create an engaging, inclusive and dynamic learning environment that prepares students for the complexities of the modern world and the world of work.

Jansen  (2009)  and  Le  Grange  (2011)  advocate  using  pedagogy  to catalyse  transformative  change  in  education.  In  this  context,  pedagogy refers to the theory and practice of education. It includes the notions of SDL,  self-motivated  learning  and  learner-centred  practices  in  line  with andragogy and heutagogy (used in adult education at HEIs). According to Todd (2014), our understanding of the temporal dimension in education should evolve to recognise pedagogy as a formative event. Todd (2014) underscores the importance of focusing on the present moment (becoming), emphasising engagement with the contextual aspects of daily interactions with students - the essence of education focusing on 'who' rather than 'what'.

Furthermore,  prioritising  transformation  involves  designing  policies, programmes  and  curricula  that  emphasise  the  complexity,  fragility  and sensitivity inherent in lived experiences (Todd 2014, p. 9). Le Grange (2011b) posits  that  transformation  involves  fully  engaging  in  a  contemporary world's complexities. The concept of presence and becoming aligns with the  ZPD,  where  attention  is  placed  on  understanding  where  students currently are and where they can potentially reach, particularly when they have  agency  and  influence  over  the  curriculum.  However,  curriculum transformation cannot be implemented when lecturers have gaps in their pedagogical armoury regarding the curriculum's 'who' and the 'what' (see Figure 6.2).

When lecturers engage in curriculum contextualisation, the challenge lies  in  determining  the  breadth  and  depth  of  adjustments  required  whether they involve understanding, additions, revisions, developments or inclusions. At North-West University (NWU), where there are three delivery sites, curriculum contextualisation varies depending on the specific needs of student and lecturer groups within each module and site. This variability demands a flexible approach to ensure that the curriculum remains relevant and effective across different contexts.

The primary role of academic staff in HE is to instruct students, often without formal pedagogical training, although some possess teaching experience within their discipline (or field of study). Contextualising the curriculum at the micro level (see Figure 6.1 and Table 6.1) necessitates disciplinary  knowledge  and  pedagogical  skills  and  connects  diverse social  contexts  to  pertinent  scenarios  and  events  (Wenger  1998). Wenger argues that curriculum change and renewal are participatory in

socio-cultural practices. Whether through design, development, renewal or  redesign,  curriculum  construction  is  an  ongoing  social  endeavour influenced  by  various  contextual  factors  (see  Table  6.2)  that  extend beyond the classroom environment, impacting lecturers and students (Cornbleth  1988).  Viewing  the  contextualised  curriculum  as  a  social process raises  fundamental  questions  about  what  is  taught,  how  it  is taught,  for  whom  and  by  whom  (Cornbleth  1988).  The  curriculum  is shaped by its context, and altering one affects the other reciprocally.

In  the  micro  curriculum,  the  lecturer's  agency  significantly  influences the  process  of  curriculum  contextualisation.  When  there  is  a  contextualisation gap between lecturers and students, it hinders curriculum transformation and renewal. Anakin et al. (2018, p. 206) highlight that a lack of shared understanding can impede effective implementation of curriculum change and development.

The dynamics of curriculum change are deeply influenced by specific contexts  (Wenger  1998),  resulting  in  distinct  processes  within  HEIs  and faculties.  A  critical  competency  for  lecturers  as  curriculum  designers involves  their  ability  to  contextualise  the  curriculum  effectively  for  TLA. Anakin et al. (2018) identified six pivotal factors - resources, ownership, leadership, academic identity, quality assurance and student self-direction -

that influence the contextualisation and transformation of the curriculum. This  process  of  curriculum  contextualisation  also  extends  to  the  nano curriculum  level,  where  lecturers'  beliefs,  motivation  and  agency  play crucial roles, as highlighted by Anakin et al. Leite, Fernandes and Figueiredo (2020) outline four critical focal points in curriculum contextualisation: the contextual characteristics, student attributes, pedagogical practices (including diversification of TLA activities) and subject content encompassing  knowledge  and  competencies.  Leite  et  al.'s  concepts resonate with how the curriculum can adapt and respond effectively at both the micro and nano levels.

Additionally, the lecturer plays a pivotal role at the curriculum's micro and macro levels, acting as a catalyst for change and as a facilitator of learning, integrating principles from pedagogy (as well as andragogy and heutagogy). In their role as facilitators, lecturers must consider a range of teaching strategies and learning activities, including SDL, blended learning methodologies, collaborative and peer learning among students, flexibility in  the  curriculum  to  enhance  learning,  problem-based  learning  (PBL), inquiry-based  learning  (IBL),  integration  of  real-world  problems  and context,  and  reflective  practices.  Lecturers  address  the  application  and authenticity of learning experiences and methods for authentic assessment within curricula. These effective strategies to enhance student learning and engagement, understanding student dynamics and needs and fostering a student-centred approach or learning-centred methods are critical elements influencing the lecturer's facilitation of and for learning. Moreover, considerations  of  student  support  mechanisms,  student  success  factors and  the  incorporation  of  student  feedback  further  shape  the  lecturer's mediation role in facilitating learning experiences. Recognising education as value-laden, implementing pedagogy as an intrinsic aspect of daily TLA practices underscores its non-neutral nature (Maistry 2011). The intricate nature  and  ethical  dimensions  of  TLA  methods  are  indispensable  for ensuring  inclusivity,  accessibility  and  an  ethos  of  care  throughout  the curriculum delivery process.

In discussions of curriculum theories and instructional practices in HE, there  is  often  insufficient  acknowledgement  of  the  nuanced  role  in facilitating  learning.  Traditional  teaching  and  learning  approaches  in  HE have typically centred around lecturer-directed methods such as lecturing, memorisation,  rote  learning  and  didactic  instruction.  However,  contemporary perspectives advocate a shift towards more inclusive and transformative educational practices (cf. Chapter 2) prioritising student-centred engagement, thus SDL. De Beer and Petersen (2016) believe this evolution is crucial for fostering environments that support diverse learning needs and encourage transformative learning experiences. Mentz and De Beer (2021)  further  contend  that  the  COVID-19  pandemic  underscored  the

prevalence of transmission-oriented teaching methods within educational contexts,  highlighting  the  need  for  a  paradigm  shift  towards  curriculum designs  that  promote  SDL  and  facilitate  more  profound  curriculum contextualisation.

Curriculum contextualisation enhances the relevance and effectiveness of SDL by adapting educational content and methods to fit the specific cultural,  social  and  local  context  in  which  learning  takes  place.  The curriculum can be contextualisation with SDL by means of the following (also see Table 6.2).

## Relevance to students' backgrounds and personal experiences

Contextualisation  ensures  that  the  curriculum  reflects  and  respects  the students' cultural diversity, social norms and local realities. When contextualising  SDL  activities,  they  are  more  likely  to  resonate  with students' backgrounds and experiences, making learning more meaningful and engaging. For example, using case studies or examples that relate to local issues or cultural contexts can enhance students' understanding and motivation in SDL.

## Enhanced motivation and engagement

Self-directed  learning  requires  students  to  be  actively  engaged  in  their learning process. Contextualising the curriculum by incorporating topics, themes  and  materials  that  are  relevant  and  interesting  to  students  can increase their motivation to learn independently. When students see the direct relevance of their learning to their lives and communities, they are more likely to invest time and effort into SDL activities.

## Facilitation of autonomy and critical thinking

Contextualisation encourages students to take ownership of their learning by  allowing  them  to  explore  meaningful  topics  and  issues  within  their context. This approach promotes critical thinking as students analyse and evaluate  information  concerning  their  cultural  and  social  surroundings. Self-directed  learning  within  a  contextualised  curriculum  thus  nurtures autonomy as students make informed decisions about their learning paths.

## Cultural and social sensitivity

Self-directed learning involves learning independently but within a framework  that  respects  cultural  sensitivities  and  social  dynamics  (see

Table 6.2, section dealing with origins and social justice). Contextualisation ensures that learning materials and activities are sensitive to cultural norms, values and practices. This sensitivity fosters a supportive learning environment where all students feel included and valued, enhancing their learning experience.

## Preparation for real-world applications

Contextualised SDL prepares students for real-world applications of their knowledge and skills. By addressing local challenges, issues and opportunities, students can apply their learning practically and meaningfully (see Table 6.2, section dealing with commercialisation and competencies). The  practical  application  enhances  the  relevance  of  SDL  and  prepares students for future careers or further education where independent learning skills are essential.

## Integration of local resources and expertise

Contextualisation encourages the integration of local resources, such as guest speakers, community projects or field trips, into SDL activities. These resources provide valuable opportunities for students to engage directly with experts and practitioners within their community, enriching their learning experiences and broadening their perspectives (see Table 6.2, section dealing with commercialisation and indigenous knowledge).

In  summary,  curriculum  contextualisation  enriches  SDL  by  making learning  more  relevant,  engaging  and  culturally  sensitive.  By  adapting educational  content  and  methods  to  fit  students'  specific  contexts, contextualisation  supports  autonomy,  critical  thinking  and  motivation, ultimately enhancing SDL's effectiveness in preparing students for lifelong learning  and  success.  Moreover,  curriculum  contextualisation  involves adapting  curriculum  content  and  methods  to  meet  students'  specific needs, interests and contexts of students and society. When linked with SDL,  this  approach  becomes  particularly  powerful  in  fostering  deeper engagement  and  relevance  for  students  and  lecturers.  Self-directed learning  emphasises  students'  autonomy  and  responsibility  for  their learning processes and goals. By contextualising the curriculum, lecturers can create SDL environments that resonate more closely with students' backgrounds,  experiences,  learning  needs  and  future  aspirations.  This alignment  enhances  the  intrinsic  motivation  and  self-determination  of students to engage with the curriculum content because they perceive its direct relevance to their lives and goals.

## Student-orientated curricula and pedagogy

A  student-centred  curriculum  is  a  transformative  approach  in  HE  that fosters SDL, empowering  students  to take responsibility for their educational journeys (Guglielmino 2013) (cf. Chapter 2). As seen from the preceding  chapters  in  this  book,  SDL  is  characterised  by  students identifying  their  learning  needs,  formulating  goals,  sourcing  materials, implementing appropriate strategies and evaluating outcomes independently (Knowles 1975). This method promotes lifelong learning by cultivating essential skills such as enquiry, critical thinking and problemsolving, which are crucial for students to adapt and thrive in a constantly evolving world (Du Toit-Brits 2020).

Implementing  a  student-centred  curriculum  necessitates  the  active involvement of students in their learning processes. Brockett and Hiemstra (1991) outlined several pedagogical strategies to enhance SDL, including using diverse teaching resources, engaging students as active participants, maximising peer learning and creating a supportive learning environment. Du Toit-Brits (2018) further emphasises the transformative potential of SDL in HE, highlighting the need for a holistic approach that integrates students' learning  characteristics  with  a  conducive  teaching  and  learning  environment. By focusing on SDL, lecturers can develop critical SDL skills such as selfreflection,  self-determination, lifelong learning and CPD, enhancing their ability to guide and support their students effectively.

Moreover, Du Toit-Brits (2019) asserts that educators' expectations and practices significantly impact their students' self-directedness. Educators who engage in reflective practices and understand their learning processes are  better  equipped  to  foster  SDL  among  their  students,  leading  to improved  educational  outcomes  and  personal  growth  for  lecturers  and students.

Adopting a student-centred curriculum is instrumental in cultivating a learning environment that encourages self-directed lifelong learners. The lecturer's  perspectives  on  curriculum,  teaching,  learning  and  student achievement influence the curriculum (Howson &amp; Kingsbury 2021). Du ToitBrits (2018) underscores the influence of changes in teaching and learning methods on students' approaches and outcomes related to SDL. Lecturers are  urged  to  promote  clear  educational  objectives,  encourage  independence, cultivate a supportive learning environment and nurture students' sense of autonomy. Moreover, within the context of the nano curriculum, educators assume  roles  as  SDL  facilitators  of  their  learning,  comprehending  their

students'  learning  capabilities  and  taking  responsibility  for  curriculum development through empowerment (Du Toit-Brits 2019). They also adopt a self-directed approach, engaging in reflection, lifelong learning and CPD practices  to  foster  transformative  learning  and  authentic  assessment. Krabbe (2013) and Teng (2019) support Du Toit-Brits' argument, asserting that embedding self-directed lecturers is crucial for enhancing SDL among students.

According to Blignaut (2017), the beliefs and actions of lecturers are pivotal,  as  the  effective  implementation  of  curriculum  hinges  on  their involvement. Blignaut asserts that educational change is deeply personal and  emotional  for  lecturers,  shaped  by  their  accumulated  teaching experiences  rather  than  entering  educational  settings  as  blank  slates. Diverse  educational  systems  and  pedagogical  traditions  often  inform their epistemological  experiences  and  perceptions.  At  the  core  of curriculum decisions lies a fundamental consideration of values related to knowledge,  skills,  methodologies  and  education's  broader  purpose.  In defining educational purpose, lecturers engage in reflective processes to delineate the potential and limitations of education. They describe their roles and gauge their involvement within institutional structures to align with  curriculum  content  and  contextual  culture.  At  the  micro  level  of curriculum  implementation,  lecturers  make  crucial  decisions  based  on their understanding of their teaching, learning and assessment frameworks; their preferences for pedagogical approaches; their facilitation  of  SDL;  their  relationships  with  students;  and  their  internal motivations for implementing chosen strategies. Roberts (2015) emphasises that lecturers' beliefs regarding educational objectives and aims, disciplinary knowledge, teaching methodologies, assessment practices, student dynamics, teacher identity, stakeholder expectations, and institutional, social, and political contexts are paramount in driving curriculum transformation. In CPD, lecturers use SDL skills to transform teaching and learning, as Du Toit-Brits (2018) explains. Doing so enhances CPD and agency and fosters  SDL  skills  like  critical  thinking,  problemsolving and self-directedness. For lecturers involved in the nano curriculum,  fostering  personal  SDL  skills  is  crucial  for  self-knowledge, meaning, innovation, creativity and ethical care in TLA environments. In addition, Du  Toit-Brits (2019) suggests that lecturer expectations influence  student  self-directedness.  Both  parties  benefit  by  taking initiative  in  learning,  using  diverse  strategies,  fostering  social  skills, reflecting on goals and becoming self-directed learners.

The nano curriculum links teaching responsiveness (Moll 2004, p. 8), providing opportunities for lecturers to optimise learning opportunities to  help  students  succeed  in  their  learning  efforts.  Moll  (2004,  p.  8)

emphasises  that  a  responsive  curriculum  addresses  students'  learning needs by teaching and assessing in ways they understand. Lecturers must align  with  students'  learning  rhythms,  lecturing  creatively,  overcoming learning resistance, building trust and addressing the emotional aspects of learning. While the formal curriculum (content, theories, disciplinary knowledge)  drives  lecturers  to  focus  on  TLA  as  outlined  in  the  micro curriculum, the hidden curriculum also plays a role at the nano level. The hidden  curriculum  consists  of  the  unspoken  values,  norms  and  beliefs imparted to students through the formal content and the social dynamics of  university,  campus  and  classroom  life  (Giroux  &amp;  Penna  1979),  often unconsciously (Alsubaie 2015).

The  lecturer's  pedagogical  approach  affects  various  aspects  of  the hidden  curriculum,  including  race,  ethics,  ethnicity,  gender,  language, identity, epistemological access and the framing of knowledge within the curriculum (Vorster 2010). Giroux and Penna (1979) argue that pedagogical models should be grounded in a theoretical framework that positions the HE TLA environment within a socio-political context. This perspective sees the HE classroom as a socialising agent that connects education to the workplace  and  other socio-political realms. Human  development  is reciprocal, with lecturers and students becoming agents of critical thinking and democratic participation by modifying HE curricula's content, pedagogy  and  methodology  (Giroux  &amp;  Penna  1979).  Jerald  (2006) emphasises  that  lecturers  who  are  aware  of  the  hidden  curriculum's significance  continually  reassess  their  classroom  attitudes.  Scholars  like Jansen (2009), Jerald (2006), and Leibowitz, Naidoo and Mayet (2017) highlight  the  importance  of  lecturers'  perceptions  of  the  curriculum, warning that ineffective use of the hidden curriculum can embed negative social beliefs and hinder social change.

Vygotsky  (1987)  incorporated  the  hidden  curriculum  into  his  sociocultural  psychology  to  develop  a  pedagogy  of  care  and  responsiveness within the ZPD. Transformative learning, closely linked to ZPD, occurs when individuals internalise concepts and knowledge rather than relying on rote learning. Engeström (2009) expands this idea by suggesting that through peer  interactions  and  multidisciplinary  learning,  novices  transform  by internalising knowledge, actions and practices rather than merely mimicking experts.

Engeström (2001) also introduces the concept of a third space where lecturers  and  students  collaborate  to  create  new  meanings  beyond  the classroom's confines. This third space in HE combines diverse knowledge, practices  and  discourses  to  foster  transformative  learning.  Engeström's notion  of  expansive  learning  is  pertinent  here,  as  it  aims  to  shift  from problematic practices to more effective methods that facilitate

transformative change (Avis 2009). Engeström and Sannino (2010) explain that expansive learning happens when students create and implement new, more  complex  activities.  This  theory  emphasises  collective  activity  and cultural creation at the community level, linking to the ZPD, where learning and development occur collectively.

Expansive learning theory emphasises the shift in the learning process from focusing on individuals to encompassing collectives and networks. Individuals start by recognising their perceptions, affirmations and actions, which shape their beliefs. As more individuals participate, they collaboratively analyse and develop a model for the ZPD. The collective contributions of individuals help create a new and enhanced activity system (Engeström &amp; Sannino 2010). Through expansive learning, lecturers and students  can  cultivate  a  'transformative  agency'  to  effectively  address challenges during periods of change  (Garraway  &amp;  Winberg  2020). Transformative  agency  occurs  when  a  lecturer's  efforts  are  increasingly geared towards driving change. According to Englund and Price (2018), this type of agency also involves understanding one's actions in relation to others and addressing the difficulties that arise from these interactions. One  way  to  comprehend  and  reflect  on  these  changes  is  through  SDL practices within student-oriented pedagogy.

## Self-directed learning and student-centredness

Student-oriented curricula and pedagogy are closely linked to SDL as they prioritise  the  students'  role  in  the  educational  process  and  emphasise autonomy,  active  engagement  and  personalised  learning  experiences. Here's how student-oriented curricula and pedagogy support SDL:

## Emphasis on learner autonomy

Both  student-oriented  curricula  and  SDL  prioritise  learner  autonomy. Student-oriented curricula encourage students to take responsibility for their learning by allowing them to make choices about their learning goals, methods and pace. Similarly, SDL requires learners to manage their learning process actively, set goals and monitor their progress independently.

## Active engagement and participation

Student-oriented curricula also promote active learning and participation by  encouraging  students  to  engage  deeply  with  the  content  through discussions,  projects  and  collaborative  activities.  Self-directed  learning also promotes active engagement as students explore topics of interest,

seek out resources and apply their knowledge meaningfully. This active participation fosters a deeper understanding and retention of knowledge.

## Personalised learning experiences

Student-oriented curricula and SDL prioritise personalised learning experiences  tailored  to  individual  student  needs,  interests  and  learning styles. Student-oriented curricula often include opportunities for students to pursue independent research, projects or electives that align with their interests. Self-directed learning allows students to choose topics, methods and resources that resonate with their goals and motivations, enhancing engagement and motivation.

## Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills

Student-oriented curricula and SDL both emphasise the development of critical  thinking,  problem-solving  and  decision-making  skills.  In  studentoriented curricula,  students  are  often  challenged  to  analyse  information critically, evaluate perspectives and propose innovative solutions to realworld  problems.  Self-directed  learning  encourages  students  to  actively seek out information, evaluate sources and apply critical thinking skills to solve problems independently.

## Preparation for lifelong learning

Both  approaches  aim  to  prepare  students  for  lifelong  learning  beyond formal education. Student-oriented curricula and SDL equip students with the skills, attitudes and  behaviours  necessary  to continue learning independently. By fostering curiosity, resilience and self-regulation, these approaches empower students to adapt to new challenges and opportunities in their personal and professional lives.

## Integration of technology and resources

Student-oriented curricula often leverage technology and diverse resources to  support  personalised  learning  experiences.  Similarly,  SDL  encourages using digital tools, online resources and multimedia platforms to access information, collaborate with peers and create learning artefacts. Technology integration enhances the flexibility and accessibility of learning opportunities in both student-oriented curricula and SDL.

In essence, student-oriented curricula and pedagogy provide a supportive framework that aligns closely with the principles and practices

of SDL. By prioritising learner autonomy, active engagement, personalised learning  experiences,  critical  thinking  and  lifelong  learning  skills,  both approaches  empower  students  to  become  independent,  self-directed learners  capable  of  navigating  and  succeeding  in  today's  complex  and dynamic world. Exploring the role of CPD in transformation is a valuable avenue.  Therefore,  it  is  worth  exploring  CPD's  value  and  impact  on curriculum transformation practices.

## The need for continuous professional development and curriculum transformation agency and the lecturer's role in curriculum transformation

This section elaborates on the need for CPD and curriculum transformation agency, as well as the role of the lecturer as a curriculum designer, developer and implementer linked to CPD.

## The need for continuous professional development and curriculum transformation agency

As  stated  previously  in  this  chapter,  lecturers  and  students  are  the  key agents  involved  in  HE  curriculum  transformation.  Within  HE,  curriculum transformation aligns  with  cycles  of  curriculum  renewal,  exposing  many lecturers to curriculum design, development and revitalisation practices. Lecturers are primarily responsible for curriculum transformation as they are critical to implementing reform initiatives (Huizinga et al. 2014), as the success of curriculum transformation, synonymous with reform, change or renewal,  hinges  upon  lecturers'  understanding  and  ownership  of  the curriculum.

In  most  faculties,  lecturers  typically  specialise  in  specific  academic disciplines, except for those in Education Sciences who focus on teacher training.  Lecturers  within  education  often  possess  formal  education  in pedagogy,  educational  methodologies  and  subject-specific  knowledge, actively  engaging in educational research. They are likely well versed in educational theories supporting pedagogical practices and participate in practical  assessments  within  work-integrated  learning  environments  for teacher  preparation.  Conversely,  faculty  members  in  other  disciplines typically  excel  as  subject  matter  experts  within  their  specialised  fields, often  lacking  formal  education  qualifications,  practical  experience  or pedagogical expertise. Matiru et al. (1995, p. 2) highlight that 'only a small number of lecturers have received professional training in teaching'.

However,  not  all  lecturers,  including  those  specialising  in  Education Sciences,  receive  curriculum  development  and  design  as  well  as  SDL training, regardless of their educational backgrounds.  According  to Maphosa  et  al.  (2014,  p.  355),  many  view  curriculum  development  as daunting  without  a  foundational  understanding  of  curriculum  design principles.  The  professional  training  gap  among lecturers predominantly centres  on  curriculum  design,  development  and  planning.  Lecturers  are expected to engage actively in curriculum planning, renewal and instructional  tasks  without  adequate  preparation  (Maphosa  et  al.  2014). Effective curriculum development requires lecturers to assess their modules critically; envision their integration within broader qualifications, programmes  and  degrees;  and  implement  TLA  strategies  that  enhance students' SDL skills. The authors emphasise curriculum developers' need to employ  theoretically  grounded  and  empirically  tested  principles  and methods (Maphosa et al. 2014). Niemelä and Tirri (2018) advocate for CPD opportunities in HE to equip lecturers with the skills necessary for effective curriculum integration and implementation, aligning with Shulman's Pedagogical Content Knowledge (PCK) framework.

Extensive literature discusses the necessity and significance of CPD in HE (Janke &amp; Tofade 2015; Panda 2022). This body of work indicates several factors  that  influence  lecturers'  preparedness  to  effectively  serve  as curriculum developers (and transformers) in HE, particularly about CPD. The reviewed literature encompasses a wide range of topics, including the schooling environment and its relevance to practices in HE. The role of CPD in curriculum transformation is unpacked further in the following section.

The individual lecturer must engage with the curriculum to facilitate its transformation  within  their  teaching,  linking  these  efforts  with  insights from literature across macro, meso, micro and nano curriculum levels. The lecturer serves as a professional and personal change agent at the micro and nano levels. According to Archer's classification (2007, 2013), structural, cultural  and  agency-related  challenges  are  prominent  in  this  context. Structural issues identified (listed below) significantly impact curriculum transformation:

- · insufficient availability of curriculum-focused CPD training opportunities to adequately prepare educators (Bantwini 2008)
- · administrative hurdles in curriculum development and revision processes (Odejide, Akanji &amp; Odekunle 2006; Rudhumbu 2015)
- · concerns and obstacles regarding procedural aspects hinder curriculum transformation (Niehaus &amp; Williams 2016)
- · inadequate skills and training in ICT/technology integration and literacy (Khoza &amp; Mpungose 2020; Safar &amp; AlKhezzi 2013)
- · deficiencies  in  pedagogical  skills  and  training  for  effective  teaching (De Beer &amp; Petersen 2016; Fraser 2016)

- · limited time and insufficient incentives are allocated for staff to engage in  curriculum  transformation  compared  to  research  activities  (Annala et al. 2022; Brownell &amp; Tanner 2012)
- · implementation of university-wide top-down curriculum reforms (Annala et al. 2022)
- · escalation  in  administrative  workload  and  paperwork  (Priestley  et  al. 2021).

The perspectives of culture and agency are integral to considerations of the nano curriculum. While the micro curriculum represents the collective understanding of lecturers within a subject group at an institutional level, the  nano  curriculum  pertains  to  individual  transformations.  Culturally, lecturers' beliefs and attitudes significantly influence curricula implementation and reform. When lecturers perceive curriculum reform as increasing their workload, lack support during the change process (Bantwini 2009), possess limited experience and understanding of reform practices (Chan &amp; Luk 2013) or fail to recognise the necessity for change, they may resist adapting their practices and curricula (Badat 2010). Challenges also arise from the insufficient integration of African epistemologies, knowledge systems (including culture, customs, practices and languages) into curricula (Mendy &amp; Madiope 2020; Shay 2016) and tensions related to professional identity (Brownell &amp; Tanner 2012), teamwork and adjustments to pedagogy to accommodate collaborative teaching efforts (Haith-Cooper 2000).

Archer (2002) defines agency as the initiatives undertaken by human agents and their capacity to act within their environmental contexts. The lecturer's responses are directly associated with the nano curriculum. From an  agency  perspective,  this  involves  lecturers  embracing  or  resisting changes, influenced by their social relationships and confidence as change agents or decision-makers. This confidence extends to their involvement in curriculum transformation, alignment of values with students, integration of ethics of care, teaching philosophy and SDL instructional practices. Selfdirected learning practices, encompassing reflexivity and self-regulation, also play a crucial role (Leibowitz 2012; Myburgh 2018). The strength or weakness of institutional structures shapes the opportunities and constraints for lecturers and students alike in their engagement with, or withdrawal from, curriculum transformation (Annala et al. 2022).

The student  plays  a  pivotal  role  in  the  micro  curriculum  within  HEIs. A critical realisation for HEIs worldwide is the evolving role of students in the  academic  landscape  and  the  fundamental  factors  driving  student success, particularly in terms of quality assurance and the advancement of academic  programmes  (Carey  2013).  Students  have  transitioned  from passive  recipients  of  knowledge  to  active  collaborators  in  the  learning process, assuming the role of self-directed learners. This shift necessitates

increased student engagement, participation and accountability within HE curricula compared to previous models, prompting a need for curriculum renewal (Bovill &amp; Bulley 2011). Van Zyl et al. (2020) highlight changes in knowledge  modes  and  advocate  for  Mode  3  knowledge  production, integrating  aspects  of  the  Fourth  Industrial  Revolution  (4IR),  artificial intelligence  (AI)  and  emerging  technologies  to  address  contemporary issues. Sandstrom (2014, p. 25) contends that adopting Mode 3 knowledge production in HE curricula prepares individuals for professional roles and cultivates critical and creative thinkers capable of engaging with various epistemological,  technological  and  systemic  perspectives.  Van  Zyl  et  al. (2020)  argue  that curriculum developers must  innovate and  tailor educational  offerings  to  equip  students  for  success  in  the  21st-century workforce.

If  we  approach  the  issues  through  Archer's  structure-culture-agency theory  (2002,  2007,  2013)  and  apply  them  to  micro-level  curriculum transformation, the role of the lecturer becomes pivotal yet challenging. Lecturers, individually and within-subject groups, hold significant authority and  carry  substantial  responsibilities  within  the  HE  environment.  Their positioning  within  knowledge  frameworks  involves  understanding  their roles within institutional structures, assessing their influence and affirming cultural  contexts.  Crucially,  they  must  actively  embrace  their  roles  as change agents in their  daily  professional  practices.  Pinar  (2012)  characterises curriculum development as often involving difficult conversations. When lecturers engage in these dialogues - whether with colleagues, students or themselves  -  they  frequently  find  value  in  pursuing  SDL  and  CPD opportunities to enhance their teaching practices through critical reflection.

## The role of the lecturer as a curriculum designer, developer and implementer

Continuous professional development holds significant prominence within HEIs  globally.  The  onset  of  the  pandemic  and  the  subsequent  shift  to remote  and  online  TLA  underscored  various  aspects,  needs,  gaps  and strengths inherent in CPD programmes. Typically, support units within HEIs are at the  forefront  of  CPD  development  and  delivery.  Continuous professional  development  is  essential  for  lecturers  as  it  is  integral  to navigating  the  evolving  landscape  of  HE,  necessitating  their  continuous adaptation and SDL (Engin &amp; Atkinson 2015). According to Maphosa et al. (2014), effective curriculum planning and development by lecturers hinge upon  adequate  training,  knowledge  and  skills  acquisition.  The  authors contend  that  understanding  their  roles  is  imperative  for  academics  to contribute to curriculum development initiatives actively.

University educators  should  possess  the  requisite  competencies  for developing TLA initiatives and crafting supplementary educational materials (Ishmail 2004; Powell 2010). Engaging lecturers in training and CPD programmes aligned with recommended practices and methodologies can  foster  departmental  improvements  in  attitudes,  values  and  skills, facilitating  effective  knowledge  transfer  within  academic  units  (Powell 2010). Insufficient emphasis has been placed on lecturers' selection and capacity  building  to  enhance  TLA  practices  and  promote  curriculum transformation (Powell 2010). Many educators are ill-prepared to address the  imperative  of  decolonial  discourse  in  their  teaching  (Ammon  2019). While CPD opportunities at NWU  address aspects of curriculum transformation,  deliberate  efforts  are  needed  to  enhance  lecturers'  and support staff's content knowledge to engage in transformative initiatives like  decolonisation  effectively.  Nevertheless,  lecturers  must  employ  SDL strategies,  such  as  reflective  practice,  to  assess  their  competencies  and prioritise skill enhancement crucial for success in their role as university educators.

The DHET (2018) introduced a framework to advance academics in their roles as university educators. This framework outlines six critical priorities for enhancing lecturer capabilities. These priorities include facilitating CPD opportunities  tailored  for  university  teachers;  establishing  supportive structures, organisations and resources; acknowledging and incentivising excellence in university teaching through leadership initiatives; fostering the dissemination and exchange of knowledge on teaching and learning practices; and nurturing the professional development of lecturers in their capacity as university educators through targeted CPD initiatives.

According  to  King's  research  (2004),  TLA  professionals  reported participating in various professional development  activities. Several activities included engaging  in dialogues with colleagues; assisting colleagues  in  enhancing  their  teaching  methodologies;  networking  with peers  from  different  HEIs;  perusing  literature  on  TLA;  utilising  online resources  related  to  TLA;  participating  in  workshops  focusing  on  TLA; exchanging  insights  with  staff  members  in  institutional  support  units; pursuing or holding qualifications in TLA; attending conferences dedicated to TLA; and applying for grants aimed at TLA initiatives.

Linked to King's findings, we focused on CPD opportunities related to curriculum transformation. Extensive scholarly literature exists regarding the necessity of CPD within HE lecturer training programmes (Crawford 2008;  Mulvey  2008).  Continuous  professional  development  includes discussions on the principles and theories underpinning curriculum design and  development,  often  connected  with  instructional  design  models (Meyers &amp; Nulty 2009; Wiliam 2013), as well as the provision of CPD training

resources and frameworks aimed at facilitating curriculum enhancement (Dafoulas, Barn &amp; Zheng 2012; Dodd 2021).

Journal articles and  documents  discussing  the  specifics  of  CPD opportunities  for  lecturers  focused  on  curriculum  development,  design, renewal  and  transformation  in  HE  contexts  are  scarce.  We  examined university webpages to explore the details of their CPD offerings related to curriculum  development,  design,  renewal,  transformation  and  fostering SDL  practices  in  lecturers.  However,  access  to  university  webpages  is limited to the public; therefore, not all documents available were accessible to analyse. The main themes from our analysis focus on:

- · the process and phases involved in curriculum design and development (Cornerstones 2021; Nelson Mandela University [NMU] 2021)
- · instructional design strategies employ frameworks like Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation, and Evaluation (ADDIE), Technological Pedagogical  Content  Knowledge  (TPACK)  theory  and  UCL's  ABC (Arena, Blended, Connected) cards
- · the  theoretical  foundations,  orientations  and  frameworks  influencing curriculum development (Quinn &amp; Vorster 2004)
- · writing and defining qualification/course outcomes and the purpose of academic degrees (CHE 2017)
- · constructive alignment in curriculum design (UoW 2022)
- · identifying and integrating graduate attributes into curricula (Oliver 2013)
- · strategies  to  facilitate  and  improve  SDL  approaches  and  strategies (Hadwen &amp; Galloway 2008).

Many HEIs  offer  staff  CPD  opportunities  to  enhance  curriculum  design, development and renewal abilities. There is limited literature on how HEIs conduct CPD training specifically for curriculum transformation, renewal and  growth.  Even  less  attention  is  given  to  SDL  regarding  curriculum practices within CPD programmes. Strategically integrating SDL developmental practices into CPD programmes would be beneficial.

Maphosa et al. (2014) contend that lecturers should undergo orientation in  the  teaching  domain  to  acquire  a  comprehensive  understanding  and appreciation of suitable pedagogical (including andragogical and heutagogical)  approaches,  alongside  developing  their  knowledge  of curriculum  orientations,  development  and  collaborative  practices.  Thus, lecturers must possess pedagogical and disciplinary expertise in academia to  excel  in  curriculum-related  tasks.  Their  role  is  multifaceted,  often extending  beyond  their  formal  training.  They  should  be  well  versed  in applicable curriculum levels. Continuous professional development aids in addressing any shortcomings (Slabbert-Redpath 2022). Therefore, CPD is linked to improving curriculum transformation to support SDL in several ways:

## Updating pedagogical approaches

Continuous professional development provides lecturers with opportunities to  stay  current  with  emerging  pedagogical  theories  and  practices  that support SDL. Continuous professional development includes understanding how  to  design  and  implement  curricula  that  foster  autonomy,  critical thinking  and  problem-solving  skills,  which  are  essential  for  SDL.  By participating in CPD, lecturers can learn effective strategies for transforming traditional curricula into more student-centred and conducive environments for SDL.

## Enhancing technological integration

Continuous  professional  development  helps  lecturers  stay  abreast  of advancements in educational technology and digital resources that can facilitate SDL. Integrating technology into curriculum transformation allows lecturers  to  create  interactive  learning  experiences,  provide  access  to online  resources  and  support  collaborative  learning  environments  -  all beneficial  for  SDL.  Continuous  professional  development  ensures  that lecturers are proficient in using technology to enhance the effectiveness and relevance of the curriculum transformation process.

## Developing contextualised learning experiences

Continuous professional development supports lecturers in understanding the importance  of  contextualising learning experiences  within their students' local, cultural and social contexts. This understanding is critical for curriculum transformation to make learning meaningful and relevant to students' lives. By participating in CPD, lecturers can learn how to adapt curricula to reflect diverse perspectives, incorporate local examples and case studies, and engage students in SDL within their contexts.

## Promoting reflective practice

Continuous professional  development  encourages  lecturers  to  engage  in reflective practice, critically evaluating their teaching methods, curriculum designs and student outcomes. This reflective process is essential for refining and  improving  curriculum  transformation  efforts  to  support  SDL  better. Through  CPD  activities  such  as  workshops,  peer  discussions  and  action research, lecturers can gather feedback, identify areas for improvement and make informed adjustments to enhance SDL implementation.

## Supporting collaborative learning communities

Continuous professional development fosters the development of collaborative learning communities among lecturers, where they can share experiences,  exchange  ideas  and  collaborate  on  improving  curriculum transformation practices. Engaging in CPD activities such as professional conferences,  seminars  and  online  forums  allows  lecturers  to  learn  from each other's successes and challenges in implementing SDL. This collaborative approach enhances the collective expertise and effectiveness of curriculum transformation efforts.

## Meeting professional standards and expectations

Continuous professional development ensures that lecturers meet professional  standards  and  expectations  for  teaching  effectiveness  and student learning outcomes. By participating in CPD, lecturers demonstrate their commitment to continuous improvement and staying abreast of best practices in curriculum transformation and SDL. This professional development enhances their skills and knowledge and contributes to the overall quality of education and student achievement.

In conclusion, CPD  plays  a  critical role in improving  curriculum transformation  to  support  SDL  effectively.  By  updating  pedagogical approaches,  integrating  technology,  developing  contextualised  learning experiences, promoting reflective practice, fostering collaborative learning communities and meeting professional standards, CPD enables lecturers to enhance the design and implementation of curricula that empower students to become self-directed learners.

At NWU, the Centre for Teaching and Learning (CTL) oversees CPD, emphasising academic recognition and development. The CTL focuses on pedagogical  skills  and  offers  flexible  CPD  options  such  as  webinars, sessions and online courses, which are accessible on the Centre's webpage. In  addition,  the  University  Capacity  Development  Programme  (UCDP) aims  to  address  transformation  challenges  in  HE.  From  2019  to  2021, opportunities  were  provided  for  lecturers  to  enhance  their  CPD  and curriculum-related skills. However, there is a need to fill the pedagogical gap  and  provide  guidance  within  the  NWU  Curriculum  Framework.  To support  institutional  curriculum  transformation,  CTL  and  Q&amp;APP  units should develop a unified approach for CPD opportunities, ensuring deep knowledge and improved pedagogical skills among academic staff (NorthWest University [NWU], 2021).

## Recommendations

The chapter aimed to answer the research questions on how the curriculum can  be  unpacked  to  improve  contextualisation,  highlighting  studentcentred pedagogy. Additionally, it explored how SDL can be included and how CPD can be improved to enhance curriculum transformation. Enhancing lecturers'  roles  as  curriculum  developers  and  designers  is  crucial  for improving  curriculum  transformation.  Doing  so  requires  contextualising curricula,  promoting  SDL,  incorporating  social  justice  and  decolonising content. Continuous professional development is vital to empower lecturers in these areas. Continuous professional development should focus on SDL, hybrid teaching strategies and fostering self-reflective skills. That said, CPD plays a pivotal role in curriculum transformation by embedding knowledge and pedagogy into teaching, learning and assessment practices. Lecturers, as change  agents,  drive  curriculum  transformation.  Expanding  CPD opportunities can help lecturers improve teaching qualifications and microcredentialing. Curriculum training and orientation are essential to bolster transformation efforts and motivate lecturers to reflect on their practices. In  summary,  streamlining  CPD  efforts  is  key  to  advancing  curriculum development and equipping lecturers with the necessary skills.

Dedicated opportunities should be created to strengthen our lecturers' scholarly research and lifelong learning. An avenue to improve scholarly skills can be through research projects linked to curriculum transformation. Lecturers engaging with SoCP would contribute to closing the gap in the knowledge society of African scholars engaged with curriculum practitioner practices. Scholarship of curriculum practices (as part of SoTL) can open more praxis-based opportunities to contribute to curriculum transformation research and CoP.

Based on our findings, it is recommended that the factors listed below are considered to enhance curriculum transformation.

- · Lecturers need to understand their role in curriculum transformation. When lecturers purposefully integrate and plan for curriculum contextualisation in the TLA of their curriculum, the notion of curriculum responsiveness occurs. Curriculum contextualisation is needed to deliver the curriculum to students.
- · The  lecturer  plays  a  pivotal  role  in  the  process  of  transforming  the curriculum. Curriculum transformation begins and ends with the lecturer's purposeful engagement, internal motivation, the decision to change or improve their curriculum, and the development of their self-directed skills.
- · Continuous professional development opportunities should be undertaken at a deeper level to stimulate reflection critically linked to the  SDL  skills  of  the  lecturer  as  a  learner  to  develop  transformative learning skills in lecturers and their students.

- · The lecturer's role as a change agent (and SDL agent) informs the level of curriculum transformation. Incentives for curriculum transformation efforts and dedicated time on task agreements of lecturers should be considered.
- · Continuous professional development opportunities should be provided to strengthen PCK, student-centred strategies, SDL and transformative learning skills, equipping lecturers to become key change agents who can affect curriculum transformation.

## Conclusion

The  concept  of  the  curriculum  is  intricate  and  multifaceted  across  its different levels. Enhancing curriculum transformation requires lecturers to recognise their role as agents of change tasked with contextualising the HE curriculum.  Lecturers  should  be  equipped  to  improve  their  pedagogical practices and beliefs and see the value of using student-centred pedagogy. When lecturers become self-directed in their pedagogical practices, SDL will be implemented in the curriculum, enhancing curriculum transformation and influencing scholarly research practices. We employed the concept of the ZPD to elucidate how learning can be scaffolded. According to Vygotsky (1987), the curriculum plays a pivotal role in supporting student learning within  their  ZPD,  facilitating  their  potential  developmental  growth.  This study  employs  the  ZPD  framework  to  reassess  learning  and  curriculum progression,  aiming  to  bridge  the  gap  between  current  practices  and aspirational goals. To conclude this chapter, we echo Barnett and Coate's (2005) assertion that the academic community should prioritise the SoTL alongside curriculum development. While progress has been made, there remains considerable ground to cover.

Thus,  the  exploration  of  CPD  through  SDL  has  clarified  the  essential responsibility lecturers play in the continuing transformation of curricula. As lecturers participate in SDL initiatives, they develop and improve their pedagogical  skills,  amend  to  changing  educational  landscapes  and  add considerably  to  the  development  of  student  learning  experiences.  This serves as a natural transition into the succeeding chapter, where we enquire into the practical implementation of an SDL curriculum. Directing precisely on the amalgamation of cooperative learning-embedded assessment, the forthcoming discussion focused on innovative approaches that empower lecturers and students, fostering a collaborative educational environment.

## Abstract

This  chapter 5   discussed  the  value  of  cooperative  learning-embedded assessment  towards  a  student-centred  curriculum,  drawing  on  social constructivist and positive interdependence theories. Through a studentcentred  curriculum,  student  agency  and  autonomy  are  implied.  'The individual's ability to self-direct is of great importance to society, working

life,  and  self-development'.  Involving  students  in  the  learning  process through cooperative learning draws on the power of the social interdependence theory, which fosters interaction and collaboration among students  and  contributes  to  students'  learning.  The  five  fundamental cooperative learning elements (positive interdependence, individual accountability, promotive interaction, social skills and group processing) set it apart from other collaborative learning groups or group work.

Although the role of students in a student-centred curriculum differs significantly  from  that  in  a  traditional  curriculum,  with  learning  being socially  supported  within  the  zone  of  proximal  development  (ZPD), assessment practices have not changed, and students are still expected to be passive during assessments. Rooted  in the principles of social constructivism,  cooperative  learning-embedded  assessment  draws  from the  social  interdependence  theory.  Social  interdependence  is  structured instead of social independence or dependence. The focus of cooperative learning-embedded assessment is, therefore, learning through assessment, which emphasises the active involvement of students.

To determine the value of cooperative learning-embedded assessment as pedagogy, the study on which this chapter reports drew from questions in an open-ended questionnaire as well as from semi-structured individual interviews. The questions aimed to determine first-year Life Sciences (LIFE) students'  perception  of  a  cooperative  learning-embedded  assessment intervention. Open coding, with the aid of ATLAS.ti™, was used to analyse the data of the current basic qualitative study.

The data analysis revealed that students perceived cooperative learningembedded assessment as valuable in their learning process. For example, participating  students  indicated  that  their  involvement  in  cooperative learning-embedded assessment enabled them to be motivated to learn, to take  the  initiative  and  responsibility  for  learning,  to  formulate  learning goals,  to  select  relevant  learning  strategies,  to  evaluate  their  learning endeavours  and  to  see  peers  as  resources.  These  skills  support  a  selfdirected learner's development.

## Introduction

Chapter  6  focused  on  curriculum  transformation  underpinned  by  selfdirected learning (SDL) advocating for greater emphasis on the student in higher  education.  This  chapter  promoted  a  student-centred  curriculum underpinned  by  SDL  and  cooperative  learning-embedded  assessment. There is  increasing  importance  on  empowering students and enhancing their participation and agency in the learning process, as the move towards

student-centred pedagogies  has  attracted considerable attention in contemporary  education.  The  idea  of  cooperative  learning-embedded assessment,  a  pedagogical  strategy  that  embeds  assessment  within cooperative  learning  principles,  is  crucial  to  this  progression  because  it promotes dynamic and mutually reinforcing interaction between learning and assessment (Lubbe 2020). This chapter explores the role of cooperative learning-embedded assessment and examines how this strategy integrates educational  theory  and  practice  to  empower  students  while  fostering effective group dynamics. This chapter draws from the social constructivist theory  (Vygotsky  1978)  and  the  positive  interdependence  (Watson  &amp; Johnson 1972) theory.

The fundamental  tenet of a student-centred curriculum is the understanding that learning should be a collaborative and active process, with students at the centre of their educational journeys (Brown 2008). Student agency and development of autonomy are intrinsically linked to a student-centred curriculum (Jääskelä et al. 2020) and are helpful in the educational  setting  and  significant  in  the  development  of  SDL  skills (Loeng 2020). The individual's capacity for self-direction is of value to society,  the  working  world  and  one's  personal  growth,  as  argued  by Loeng (2020).

The educational strategy of cooperative learning, which is based on the theory  of  social  interdependence,  is  seen  as  a  powerful  way  to  put the principles of student-centredness and active involvement into practice (Johnson  &amp;  Johnson  2015).  This  strategy  uses  the  strength  of  positive interdependence, which has been linked to effective cooperative learning (Johnson &amp; Johnson 2015). Positive interdependence fosters a culture where students see their successes as connected to those of their peers, inspiring a shared commitment to group success (Gillies 2016). Learning effects are further  reinforced  by  the  subsequent  constructive  interaction  between group members (Slavin 2014). Moreover, positive interdependence, individual accountability, promotive interaction, social skills and group processing are the five distinctive components that distinguish cooperative learning from other collaborative group work (Johnson &amp; Johnson 2015).

Conciliating the conventional role of students in assessment practices with  the  principles  of  active  and  participatory  learning  (i.e.  cooperative learning)  is  a  fundamental  aspect  of  moving  towards  a  student-centred curriculum.  In  the  past,  assessments  frequently  portrayed  students  as passive consumers of information, which was inconsistent with 21st-century higher education. Cooperative learning-embedded assessment links these two seemingly incompatible paradigms (Lubbe 2020). Cooperative learning-embedded  assessment  fosters  a  holistic  learning  environment

where assessment becomes an important part of the learning process by structuring  social  interdependence  rather  than  social  independence  or reliance (Butera &amp; Buchs 2019; Lubbe 2020; Watson &amp; Johnson 1972). This method shifts the emphasis from individual performance and competition, frequently  emphasised  in  traditional  examinations,  to  tapping  into  the power of the social constructivist theory and enabling learning through assessment (Lubbe 2020; Lubbe &amp; Mentz 2021). The social constructivist theory (see Kay &amp; Kibble 2016; Vygotsky 1978), which encourages socially supported  learning  within  the  zone  of  proximal  development  (ZPD), strongly resonates with this point of view. Using the social constructivist theory  as  a  lens  eliminates  the  contradiction  between  assessment  and learning, leading to a more unified educational environment where students actively participate in their learning process by developing their SDL skills (Lubbe 2020).

Educators could promote  a  shift towards empowering  students, encouraging active involvement, and developing a sense of student agency, autonomy and self-directedness. Education is constantly adapting to meet the  demands  of  a  fast-changing  world.  In  this  chapter,  the  researchers therefore discuss the value of how the integration of cooperative learning and assessment might redefine the educational environment in a way that resonates with the varied and dynamic requirements of students. The next section outlines the problem statement.

## Problem statement

Modern education is experiencing a fundamental transformation towards student-centred  pedagogies,  as  it  recognises  the  necessity  of  involving students actively in their educational journeys (Bremner, Sakata &amp; Cameron 2022; Wright 2011). The realisation that education should not be a passive transmission of knowledge but rather an interactive and dynamic process fostering  student  agency  (i.e.  giving  students  a  voice),  autonomy  and critical thinking should inspire the shift from traditional didactic instruction to  more  collaborative  and  enjoyable  learning  experiences.  The  conflict between  traditional  assessment  methods  and  student-centred  learning, however,  remains  an  obstacle,  especially  when  attempting  to  engage students actively in assessing their development (Lubbe 2020). As a result, two issues need to be resolved: how to make assessment an integral and collaborative part of the learning process (instead of a stand-alone process), while still incorporating the principles of a student-centred curriculum and cooperative learning.

The  discrepancy  between  the  changing  nature  of  education  and conventional assessment methods emphasises the necessity of bridging

the divide between ideas of student-centred learning and the predominating assessment  paradigms  (Bennett  2015).  Integrating  assessment  into  a cooperative learning framework poses a theoretical and practical difficulty, even though cooperative learning offers a potential path to more active and interactive learning experiences (Mendo-Lázaro et al. 2022). Improving learning outcomes and evaluative insights necessitates a complex endeavour  of  re-evaluating  assessment  as  a  dynamic  and  interactive process  while  ensuring  the  smooth  integration  of  cooperative  learning approaches and assessment processes. To realise the goal of a studentcentred curriculum where students are active agents in their learning and assessment processes, it is, therefore, necessary to investigate and explicate the  possibilities of cooperative  learning-embedded  assessment  as  a transformative solution to this issue (Lubbe 2020). To this end, determining students' perceptions of being involved in cooperative learning-embedded assessment will provide insight into the value thereof for a student-centred curriculum. Therefore, the question that directed this study was: What are first-year  Life  Sciences  students'  perceptions  of  cooperative  learningembedded assessment?

The next section explains the components underpinning this research, based  on  the  social  constructivist  theory  and  social  interdependence theory.

## Theoretical and conceptual framework

Integrating cooperative learning-embedded assessment, a student-centred curriculum and SDL skills represents a dynamic framework that harmonises pedagogical theory and practice to improve learning. A thorough understanding of how these components interact to produce a comprehensive  and  robust  educational  experience  is  provided  by  this framework, which draws on fundamental ideas from the social constructivists and social interdependence theory. Learning is a socially mediated process through contact with peers and educators (Vygotsky 1978). This theoretical framework makes it possible to comprehend how these components are fully interrelated.

## Cooperative learning-embedded assessment

Over the past 50 years, Vygotsky's theories on social constructivism have remained highly relevant and influential and shaped educational practices. It has even been foundational for subsequent theories.

The theoretical foundations of cooperative learning-embedded assessment  can  also  be  based  on  the  social  constructivist  theory

(Vygotsky  1978)  and  the  social  interdependence  theory  (Johnson  &amp; Johnson 2015), extended in 1972 by Watson and Johnson to the 'structureprocess-outcome  theory'  for  cooperation.  According  to  Watson  and Johnson (1972), the outcomes of the interaction among group members are influenced by how the individual members react, which depends on how the interdependence is structured (Table 7.1). The social interdependence  theory  emphasises  positive  interdependence  among group  members,  where  individual  success  is  intertwined  with  group achievement.  Table  7.1  shows  that  positive  interdependence  leads  to cooperation, which leads to promotive interaction among  group members.  Promotive  interaction  within  a  group  could  result  in  an increased  effort  to  achieve  positive  interpersonal  relationships  and psychological  health  (Johnson  &amp;  Johnson  2015,  2021).  Members  of  a group help and assist one another by exchanging resources, providing and  receiving  feedback,  encouraging  one  another's  increased  efforts, engaging in social skills required for group success, reflecting on current and  desired  teamwork,  and  challenging  cognitive  skills  (Johnson  &amp; Johnson 2021). Promotive interaction leads to group members focusing on the learning of all group members rather than just their own (Johnson &amp; Johnson 2015).

TABLE 7.1: Interaction patterns of interdependence.

| How social interdependence is  structured   | How individual group  members react   | The type of group  interaction   |
|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Positive interdependence                    | Cooperation                           | Promotive interaction            |
| No interdependence                          | As individuals                        | No interaction                   |
| Negative interdependence                    | Competition                           | Oppositional interaction         |

In  the  absence  of  interdependence,  group  members  believe  they  can achieve their goals on their own. As a result, group members will act solely in their own  interests,  with  no  interaction  between  them.  Negative interaction results in competitive behaviour among group members and oppositional interaction. Oppositional interaction not only causes individual group members to focus on increasing their own success but also gives rise to group members obstructing each other's efforts to achieve their goals. According to Johnson and Johnson (2015), individualistic and competitive efforts result in decreased  effort  to  achieve,  negative  interpersonal relationships and psychological maladjustment.

The presence of the following five basic cooperative learning principles distinguishes  the  cooperative  environment  from  other  collaborative  or group work endeavours (Johnson &amp; Johnson 2015; Johnson, Johnson &amp; Holubec 2013):

- · positive interdependence
- · individual accountability
- · promotive interaction
- · social skills
- · group processing.

These principles  are  the  heartbeat  of  cooperative  learning  and,  subsequently, of  cooperative  learning-embedded  assessment  (Lubbe  2020)  and  are therefore discussed below.

Positive interdependence: This  principle emphasises the idea that the success of group members is interconnected. Individuals thus believe that their  own  accomplishments  are  linked  to  the  accomplishments  of  their peers. Positive interdependence encourages collaborative effort because success benefits all group members. Students are more likely to support and help one another to achieve the best possible collective results when they recognise their shared goals and outcomes (Johnson &amp; Johnson 2015).

Individual  accountability: According  to  Tran  (2013,  p.  103),  'individual accountability is considered as the degree to which the achievement of the group depends on the individual learning of all group members'. Individual accountability  ensures  that  each  group  member  is  accountable  for contributing  to  and  mastering  learning.  This  principle  discourages  free riding or relying solely on others by encouraging active participation and engagement from all group members (Johnson &amp; Johnson 2015).

Promotive  interaction: Johnson  and  Johnson  (2021,  p.  56)  state  that positive interaction results in 'students promoting each other's success by sharing resources, helping, assisting, supporting, encouraging and praising each other's efforts to learn'. The importance of meaningful communication and  interaction  among  group  members  is  emphasised  by  encouraging interaction. Students collectively deepen their understanding of the content through  discussions,  explanations  and  sharing  of  ideas.  Engaging  in dialogue  and  explaining  to  peers  not  only  benefit  the  receiver  but  also reinforce the understanding of the person explaining, thereby strengthening the immediate feedback process.

Social  skills: Social  skills  development  within  a  cooperative  learning context  is  critical  for  effective  collaboration.  These  skills  include  active listening, effective communication, conflict resolution and mutual respect (Gillies 2016). Social skills promote  fluid group  dynamics,  ensuring constructive interactions and focus on the task. Knowing and trusting one's group  members,  communicating  clearly  and  unambiguously,  accepting and supporting one another, and constructively resolving conflict within the group are all important social skills to have when coordinating efforts to achieve common goals (Johnson &amp; Johnson 2021). According to Tran

(2013, p. 104), social skills do not only promote higher achievement 'but they  also  contribute  to  the  development  of  more  positive  relationships among group members'.

Group processing: Regular reflection on the effectiveness of the group's collaborative efforts is part of group processing. Group members evaluate what is working well and identify areas for improvement in task performance and  group  dynamics  (Johnson  &amp;  Johnson  2015).  This  self-evaluation encourages continuous improvement, enhancing the overall performance and cohesion of the group.

Cooperative learning-embedded assessment focuses on assessment as a  social  learning  activity  and  thus  on  learning  through  assessment. Cooperative learning-embedded assessment is conceptualised as a learning activity within a social constructivist, cooperative learning context rather than as an addition to the teaching and learning process. According to Webb et al. (2019), the perspectives on productive student participation often centre on explaining one's thinking and engaging with the ideas of others. The characteristics of cooperative learning-embedded assessment and a proposed model are discussed below.

One of the distinguishing features of cooperative learning-embedded assessment  is  that  all  assessment  activities  occur  within  a  cooperative learning environment (see Figure 7.1). Each assessment activity incorporates

positive interdependence, individual accountability, promotive interaction, social skills and group processing. Assignable to the social constructivist approach, teaching, learning  and  assessment  are  inseparable  processes. This implies that assessment  activities  -  as opposed  to  traditional competitive or individualistic assessments - are also participative in nature. Cooperative learning-embedded assessment encourages learning through assessment,  emphasising  the  learning  process  rather  than  assessment practices (Lubbe 2020). Therefore, assessment is regarded as a teaching and learning tool.

Evident from Figure 7.1 are  the  following  key  characteristics  of  cooperative learning-embedded assessment (Lubbe 2020):

- · Assessment  should  be  a  social  activity  because  of  the  theoretical underpinnings  of  cooperative  learning-embedded  assessment,  the participatory capabilities of assessment instruments should be considered when selecting these instruments. If the chosen assessment instrument  was  not  participative  in  nature  (for  example,  standard individual  tests),  it  had  to  be  rebuilt  to  allow  for  participation,  which meant the assessment instrument had to be administered in cooperative learning  groups.  Individual  tests  could  benefit  from  a  participatory component to ensure that assessment is grounded in social constructivist theory.  This  could  be  accomplished,  for  example,  by  having  students write  the  test  together.  The  cooperative  learning  group  receives  one copy of the same test in this case. This not only ensures that the test is a  social  activity  but  also  structures  individual  accountability.  Another option is to have students take the test in cooperative learning groups first, followed by individual testing. In this case, the test would not only be a social activity that encourages positive interdependence but also be an individual test component that encourages personal accountability. Students  could  also  take  the  individual  test  and  retake  it  in  their cooperative learning groups. Regardless of the order in which the tests are written, social skills would be developed.
- · Assessment should provide an opportunity for metacognitive reflection -the  ability  to  evaluate  one's  own  learning  is  not  only  one  of  the characteristics of a self-directed learner, but it is also part of the repertoire of an assessment-literate student (Price et al. 2012). Make time  for  metacognitive  reflection  when  preparing  for  cooperative learning-embedded assessment. Metacognitive reflection, for example, could  be  accomplished  by  using  reflection  prompts  or  questions (Ifenthaler 2012). These reflection prompts or questions can be answered online or as part of the assessment tool. When students complete an individual test followed by a cooperative learning group test, they can reflect on and self-assess their individual responses while completing the  cooperative  learning  group  test.  Following  such  an  assessment,

students may be asked to complete an online reflection sheet in class (Ifenthaler 2012). In such a reflective activity, students would be asked to reflect on how they prepared for the test, how much time they spent preparing for it, whether they could adapt their learning strategies and what they would do differently the next time.

- · Assessment  can  be  for  formative  and  summative  purposes -  the participatory  nature  of  cooperative  learning-embedded  assessments, rooted  in  social  constructivist  theory  and  embedded  in  cooperative learning, enables such assessment to be used for both formative and summative  assessment  at  the  same  time  (Brookhart  &amp;  Durkin  2003; Taylor 2011). As a result, assessment activities embedded in cooperative learning assess learning outcomes, identify learning gaps and improve teaching and learning. As a result, a cooperative learning group test is more  than  just  a  high-stakes  summative  assessment  at  the  end  of instruction. The results of an individual test followed by a cooperative learning group test could be used to assess learning outcomes while diagnosing learning gaps (Stiggins &amp; Chappuis 2005).
- · Assessment  should  include  an  opportunity  for  immediate  feedforward -  effective  feedback  strategies  in  assessment  practices  are well  documented.  When  developing  and  implementing  cooperative learning-embedded assessment instruments, opportunities for effective feedback should be purposefully structured, and the feedback provider  (i.e.  peers,  lecturer  or  both)  should  be  identified.  When students write an individual test followed by a cooperative learning group  test,  peers  provide  immediate  feedback  when  discussing individual answers to reach a consensus on the correct answer. If the cooperative learning group test is written first, followed by an individual test, the immediate feedback provided by peers helps to close the gap between current and desired achievement (Koen, Bitzer &amp; Beets 2012). As a result, students can act almost immediately on peer feedback. Another option would be to have students write an individual test and then  work  together  in  cooperative  learning  groups  to  create  a memorandum  for  the  written  test.  Students  can  use  any  relevant resources when compiling the memorandum, as learning is encouraged. The students can then use the memorandum they have compiled to peer assess the individual tests. Peers can discuss their individual tests in  relation  to  the  memorandum to ensure immediate feedback. This ongoing dialogue will allow students to improve their self-awareness and  social  skills.  Following  such  a  cooperative  learning-embedded assessment  intervention,  the  lecturer  can  prompt  a  whole-class discussion to encourage ongoing lecturer-peer dialogue about learning.  The  group-processing element of cooperative learning will also be ensured through whole-class discussion (Lubbe 2020).

- · Learning  and  assessment  should  occur  within  a  cooperative  learning environment -creating and implementing cooperative learningembedded assessment necessitates structuring the assessment instrument around the five basic cooperative learning elements (Lubbe 2020). It is worth noting that all five cooperative learning elements (see 7.3.1) have to be present to ensure positive interdependence, which will lead to student cooperation. Positive interdependence  could be structured  by  ensuring  that  each  cooperative  learning  group  only receives one copy of the test. Students must therefore collaborate to complete the single test copy. Keeping the groups small - two or four students per cooperative learning group - would help to foster positive interdependence. Individual accountability can be structured by combining the cooperative learning group test with an individual test. Furthermore, if the lecturer decides to use the test as a summative form of assessment, the individual test may be weighted more heavily than the cooperative learning group test. Promoting positive interaction can be  achieved  by  keeping  the  groups  small  (two  or  four  students  per cooperative learning group) and having students write the cooperative learning group test facing each other around a table. The cooperative learning group test can be used before or after the individual test to ensure small-group social skills. Cooperative learning-embedded assessment can help students improve their small-group social skills by discussing the test, explaining the work, reaching a consensus on the correct  answer  and  providing  feedback.  Group  processing  occurs through  feedback  when  students  complete  the  cooperative  learning group test and is performed because feedback may include advice on how  to  study  differently,  as  well  as  content-related  advice.  After completing and submitting the individual and group tests, whole-class processing can occur through ongoing lecturer-peer dialogue (Johnson &amp; Johnson 2015).
- · Learning occurs through the assessment - a paradigm shift is required when  developing  and  implementing  cooperative  learning-embedded assessment. The emphasis should not be on assessment (assessment of learning,  assessment for learning,  assessment as learning)  but  on learning through assessment. Cooperative learning-embedded assessment  proposes  a  new  approach  to  assessment  that  prioritises learning: learning through assessment.  This  assessment  approach considers  teaching,  learning  and  assessment  as  inseparable  activities within a  social  constructivist  context.  Students  can  learn  from  cooperative learning-embedded assessment because the emphasis is on the learning process rather than on the form or purpose of assessment.

It  is  critical  for  the  successful implementation of a cooperative learningembedded assessment that the above factors all be considered explicitly

when  developing  such  an  assessment.  Cooperative  learning  activities support  the  ideals  of  promotive  interdependence  by  fostering  peer engagement,  fostering  shared  objectives  and  promoting  constructive discourse (Johnson &amp; Johnson 2015). The cooperative learning principles embedded  in  assessment  tasks  make  the  most  of  the  effectiveness  of teamwork  by  allowing  students  to  participate  in  assessments  through active discussions and group reflection. Cooperative learning-embedded assessment is a logical outgrowth of the social nature of learning within the social constructivist paradigm. Students who participate in such assessment conversations not only strengthen their understanding but also co-create knowledge with their peers, in line with the social constructivist principles, as well as fostering autonomy.

## Student-centred curriculum and self-directed learning

A student-centred curriculum is characterised by an educator who acts as a facilitator to support students' learning processes (Duschl, Schweingruber &amp; Shouse  2007).  The  educator  is  therefore  not  transmitting  knowledge  to students  via  lectures,  textbooks  or  recipe-like  activities,  with  each  step explicitly outlined and dictated by the educator (Duschl et al. 2007; McLean &amp; Gibbs  2010).  According  to  Shrivastava  and  Shrivastava  (2020,  p.  53),  'a student-centred  curriculum  is  the  one  in  which  students  themselves  are accountable for the teaching-learning process'. The student is therefore at the centre of the learning opportunities and process and must be supported and empowered to take an active role in his or her learning process. A studentcentred curriculum is characterised by key 21st-century skills, such as critical thinking, collaboration and SDL skills (Wulf 2019).

Self-directed learning is influenced by the writings of Knowles (1975) and Guglielmino (1978). This process emphasises how students may take charge  of  their  educational  experiences  by  establishing  goals,  creating learning strategies and monitoring their progress. Self-directed learning is also said to be 'our most basic, natural response to newness, problems, or challenges' (Guglielmino &amp; Long 2011, p. 5). Assessment that is integrated into cooperative learning creates a setting that helps develop SDL abilities (Lubbe 2020). Students gain metacognitive abilities and a sense of agency over  their  learning  by  actively  participating  in  the  assessment  tasks, identifying their learning needs and reflecting on their learning progress. The characteristics of SDL in which students actively define their educational trajectories (Guglielmino 1978; Knowles 1975; Warburton &amp; Volet 2012) are reflected in the cooperative learning-embedded assessment tasks. According to social constructivism, SDL is therefore seen as having a part in the construction of knowledge.

In essence, a social constructivist framework that incorporates cooperative learning-embedded  assessment,  a  student-centred  curriculum  and  SDL created  a  lucid  and  harmonious  backdrop  for  this  study.  Theoretically, social  constructivism  underpins  the  significance  of  group  interactions, meaningful  and  active  involvement,  and  student  agency  in  the  learning process. The interconnected components support one another, resulting in a dynamic, interactive environment. An explanation of the methods used in this research to answer the research question is discussed below.

## Research methodology

The sections below position this research within the interpretivist paradigm and outline all aspects of the research methodology that were implemented during this study, keeping in mind that this study was aimed at establishing whether the implementation of cooperative learning-embedded assessment promoted a student-centred curriculum.

## Research paradigm

The qualitative research for the study on which this chapter reports was guided by the interpretivist research paradigm. This paradigm was deemed appropriate  because  'communication,  interaction,  and  practice'  (Tracy 2019, p. 51) are required to construct reality and knowledge, and this would allow  for  the  consideration  of  diverging  participant  perspectives  and experiences  (Mwita  2022;  Rehman  &amp;  Alharthi  2016).  The  interpretivist paradigm enabled the researchers to interpret the meanings of the data gathered  from  the  experiences  of  the  participants.  This  viewpoint  also influenced the inductive analysis of students' responses.

## Research design

According to Merriam (2009) and Tracy (2019), the focus of qualitative research  is  on  the  way  in  which  meaning  is  ascribed  to  people's  lived experiences,  and  how  these  experiences  are  interpreted.  To  that  end,  a basic qualitative research design (see Merriam 2009; Tracy 2019) was used, consistent with this research objective and question of this study.

## Research ethics consideration

National  and  institutional  ethics  guidelines  and  policies  were  followed throughout the research process, and data were only collected after ethical clearance and gatekeeper permission had been obtained from the relevant ethics  committee  [NWU-HS-2016-0178]. The participants  were  first-year

students enrolled in the Life Sciences (LIFE) module, and they were assured that no one would be penalised for not participating. Moreover, no student group or class was denied the opportunity to participate in the investigation. The research component was entirely optional, and participants were free to opt out at any time. A third party handled participant recruitment and informed  consent.  Only  data  from  participants  who  provided  informed consent were included in the analysis. The anonymity of participants was maintained throughout the data handling process, and ethical data storage procedures were followed.

## Sampling and data collection

All  first-year  LIFE  students  enrolled  at  the  Faculty  of  Education  at  the university  where  this  study  was  conducted  and  who  provided  informed consent completed an open-ended questionnaire on their experiences of cooperative learning-embedded assessment ( n = 82). The qualitative data were  gathered  using  the  textual  data  obtained  from  the  open-ended questionnaire.  According  to  Maree  and  Pietersen  (2016),  the  analysis  of open-ended questionnaires is  complex  because  participants  answer  the questions in detailed phrases or comments instead of single words.

The  open-ended  questionnaire  was  administered  to  the  participants after their involvement in the cooperative learning-embedded assessment intervention. Even though all first-year LIFE students were exposed to the cooperative learning-embedded assessment intervention, partaking in the research was voluntary.

## Data analysis

According  to  Seidel  (1998),  qualitative  data  analysis  is  an  ongoing  and iterative process through which aspects are noticed, collected and thought through. Even though qualitative data analysis entails general steps to be followed (i.e. preparing the data, organising the data and coding the data), qualitative data analysis is a non-linear process. (Nieuwenhuis 2016). Open coding was used for analysing the data gathered from the open-ended questionnaires.  ATLAS.ti™  was  the c omputera ssisted q ualitative d ata a nalysis s oftware (CAQDAS) used to analyse the data.

## Trustworthiness

The need to assess the quality of qualitative research cannot be overstated (Nieuwenhuis  2016;  Schurink,  Fouché  &amp;  De  Vos  2011).  According  to Denscombe (2021), credibility, transferability, dependability and confirmability

are the factors that qualitative researchers should consider to make sure that their  study  is  reliable.  The  term credibility describes  how  believable  and reliable  the  research  is.  The  credibility  of  this  study  was  established  by carefully choosing the participant quotes to make sure that the thesis was fully supported and by disclosing any limitations upfront so that the reader would understand how the conclusions were reached. Transferability , which is  related  to  the  generalisability  of  the  research  findings,  was  established during this investigation by refraining from generalising to the entire study population to understand the perspectives of the participants better. Merriam (2009) defines dependability as the degree to which the research findings can  be  replicated  in  a  similar  setting  and  with  comparable  participants. By meticulously analysing negative cases and discrepancies, dependability was established. Confirmability is  the  degree  to  which  the  results  of  the research can be verified  by  additional  research.  Confirmability  was  established during  this  investigation  by  repeatedly  reviewing  the  data  collected  and analysing it to make sure that it would be possible that the findings could be repeated by other researchers. The ethical guidelines in the research were equally important.

In the next section, the findings of this research are discussed.

## Findings

The responses to the open-ended questionnaire are used to discuss the findings of this study and to make recommendations for careful cooperative learning-embedded assessment planning, implementation and evaluation. After  the  questionnaire  was  completed,  the  data  were  analysed  using ATLAS.ti™. Codes and group codes were identified that were relevant to the research question about students' perceptions of cooperative learningembedded  assessment.  The  questionnaire  comprised  the  following  five questions:

- Q1 -What is, according to you, the purpose of assessment in this LIFE module?
- Q2 -Please  explain  the  role  that  assessment  played  in  your  learning process throughout the LIFE module.
- Q3 -n which way did the assessment practices used in this LIFE module I influence your learning throughout the semester?
- Q4  n which way did the assessment practices used in this LIFE module I influence your preparation for the examination?
- Q5 -What is your general feeling regarding the assessment practices, which were implemented in the LIFE module?

The questions posed and reflected above were designed to ascertain students' perceptions of cooperative learning-embedded assessment in terms of the perceived  purpose  thereof,  the  perceived  role  of  cooperative  learningembedded assessment in their learning process and the perceived influence of cooperative learning-embedded assessment on their learning process.

The  following  code  groups  concerning  the  students'  perception  of cooperative learning-embedded assessment were identified upon analysing the codes:

- · curiosity and motivation
- · feedback mechanism
- · enhanced learning
- · preparation for the examination
- · identifying learning gaps
- · development as a future teacher
- · participative nature
- · self-assessment.

These code groups were analysed and will be discussed briefly. Table 7.2 presents the codes, code groups and some quotes associated with students' overall perception of cooperative learning-embedded assessment.

The  data  analysis  of  the  students'  responses  revealed  the  perceived value  of  cooperative  learning-embedded  assessment  relating  to  their learning process  and  progress. Some  students  indicated  that  their involvement  in  cooperative  learning-embedded  assessment  triggered their curiosity and created a sense of encouragement and motivation to learn. Below are some verbatim comments of participants on this theme of curiosity  and  motivation.  Please  note  that  all  quotations  below  are reproduced verbatim and unedited:

Key: CL-EA, cooperative learning-embedded assessment.

intervention was a motivational tool contributing to the students who take ownership of their learning process. As none of the students indicated that they were motivated by marks or grades, it might indicate that students were intrinsically motivated by their involvement in cooperative learningembedded assessment. Although two students indicated a need for more feedback, most students perceived cooperative learning-embedded assessment as an immediate feedback mechanism allowing them to learn from their mistakes.

In this regard, verbatim quotes as examples of the participants' views on feedback during cooperative learning-embedded assessment are:

' After the assessment I will know where I need to focus more, especially after getting the feedback.' (P34, undisclosed gender, February 2019)

'It [cooperative learning-embedded assessment] gives learners encouragement because  lecturers  provide  positive  feedback  and  help  me  see  where  my developmental needs are.' (P21, undisclosed gender, February 2019)

Most  students  appeared  to  have  taken  advantage  of  the  feedback opportunities  provided  by  cooperative  learning-embedded  assessment and to have recognised the value of immediate feedback towards their learning progress. One student also indicated that even more feedback is necessary. Immediate feedback, which feeds forward into students' learning process, is one of the tenets of cooperative learning-embedded assessment, which might be why, yet another student said:

'It [cooperative learning-embedded assessment] has had a positive impact on my learning, because I immediately got feedback on what I know well enough and what I need to revise ….' (P39, undisclosed gender, February 2019)

In general, participating students valued cooperative learning-embedded assessment not only in terms of receiving feedback but also in terms of providing  feedback.  In  the  current  investigation,  cooperative  learningembedded  assessment  was  designed  to  include  the  opportunity  for immediate feed-forward via cooperative learning and its basic principles. The  participative  nature  of  cooperative  learning-embedded  assessment appears to have provided first-year LIFE students with the opportunity to give  and  receive  feedback  and  to  value  the  feedback  mechanism  as beneficial to their learning progress. Not only should a self-directed learner be able to give and receive feedback, but he or she should also be skilful in utilising the feedback for improved learning, hence taking greater ownership throughout the learning process.

Most participating students indicated that cooperative learningembedded  assessment provided them with an enhanced learning opportunity through which they could apply their knowledge, and students said:

- 'I  was  more focused on applying the work, rather than just wanting to study everything. It required me to understand what I was learning.' (P69, undisclosed gender, February 2019)
- ' Assessments helped me apply the knowledge I learned from the classroom.' (P76, undisclosed gender, February 2019)
- It seems  that  cooperative  learning-embedded  assessment  improved students' critical thinking skills, not only relating to answering questions but  also  to  implementing  cooperative  learning-embedded  assessment. One participating student said:

'This [cooperative  learning-embedded  assessment]  has  influenced  me  by looking  more  critically  at  the  type  of  assessment  done.'  (P63,  undisclosed gender, February 2019)

Critically reflecting on the type of assessment to which one is exposed might enable one to be cognisant of the possible influence of cooperative learningembedded assessment on the learning process. Another student said:

'I could identify which work was important.' (P53, undisclosed gender, February 2019)

Identifying  important  content  is  related  to  identifying  learning  gaps, another important characteristic of a self-directed learner. It seems as if the participation in cooperative learning-embedded assessment enabled most participating  students  to  identify  learning  gaps  by  determining  what  is important and by monitoring their progress. The following quotes indicate some thoughts of students about the importance of cooperative learningembedded assessment in monitoring their learning progress:

- 'I  would go through all the assessment work again to see if I understand the work better than I did before.' (P82, undisclosed gender, February 2019)

'The assessment  [cooperative  learning-embedded  assessment]  influenced my performance as I used all the resources that were provided to help myself evaluate how much I have learned on certain content.' (P1, undisclosed gender, February 2019)

Someone who is self-directed in their learning process will be able to monitor  their  own  learning  progress.  The  design  of  the  cooperative learning-embedded  assessment  appears  to  have  given  students  a foundation on which to build the ability to keep track of their academic progress.  After  identifying  their  learning  needs  and  tracking  their progress, self-directed learners can select the best learning strategies. It was stated by several students that the cooperative learning-embedded assessment  assisted  them  in  selecting  appropriate  learning  strategies based on feedback provided within the cooperative learning-embedded assessment.

Verbatim examples of some of their opinions are listed below:

' Assessment has helped me improve my learning methods. Through assessment, I saw that I had to adjust my learning to understand the work and not just learn the work.' (P44, undisclosed gender, February 2019)

'It  [cooperative  learning-embedded  assessment]  forced  me  to  learn  in  more detail.  To  experiment  with  various  learning  methods.  Use  various  resources during the learning process.' (P17, undisclosed gender, February 2019)

Through the involvement in cooperative learning-embedded assessment, students'  work  was  enhanced,  their  understanding  of  the  material  was deepened, they were able to learn new skills, their learning was positively influenced, they were able to use their problem-solving abilities and they were guided in their learning process. Some students perceived cooperative

learning-embedded assessment also to support autonomous learning and said:

'Its purpose is to make learners work themselves and rely less on the lecturer.' (P73, undisclosed gender, February 2019)

Being more autonomous in one's learning is an important SDL skill. Several responses  from  students  regarding  their  perceptions  of  cooperative learning-embedded assessment pointed to its ability to promote learning. One student said:

'The assessment gave all of us the opportunity to improve our learning because it was fair and available for everyone.' (P1, undisclosed gender, February 2019)

## Another student said:

'It  [cooperative learning-embedded assessment] was a good way of learning new things.' (P33, undisclosed gender, February 2019)

The  quote  above  also  indicates  that  most  students  learned  while  doing cooperative  learning-embedded  assessments;  hence,  they  were  learning through assessment. It was also stated that cooperative learning-embedded assessment  was  used  as  a pedagogical  tool ,  as  one  of  the  purposes  of cooperative learning-embedded assessment is to expose students to the module  content.  Because  the  implemented  assessment  activities  were embedded within cooperative learning, they might have contributed more to  students'  perception  of  cooperative  learning-embedded  assessment compared to a stand-alone assessment strategy. Furthermore, some students indicated  that  cooperative  learning-embedded  assessment  is  valuable  in preparing for the examination opportunity. One participating student said:

'I was better prepared [for the examination] and already understood the content I needed to learn.' (P71, undisclosed gender, February 2019)

The  participative  nature  of  cooperative  learning-embedded  assessment requires  discussion  for  shared  consensus,  which  might  have  assisted students further in taking ownership of their learning after identifying their learning gaps before the summative examination opportunity. The timely feedback mechanism within cooperative learning-embedded assessment might have fed forward. Students said:

'It  [cooperative  learning-embedded  assessment]  gave  me  confidence  and  it made me see different  perspectives  regarding  this  [LIFE]  module  and  learn more.' (P8, undisclosed gender, February 2019)

'The feedback that I got helped me to prepare for this exam.' (P21, undisclosed gender, February 2019)

Additionally, the participatory nature of cooperative learning-embedded assessment  might  have  contributed  to  additional  and  further  learning.

Although  three  students  indicated  that  cooperative  learning-embedded assessment  did  not  influence  how  they  prepared  for  the  examination opportunity, several students indicated that cooperative learningembedded assessment supported their preparation. The following quotes reflect students' attitudes towards preparation for the examination:

'Can now remember long-term work needed for exams and I know what to work on.' (P56, undisclosed gender, February 2019)

'It  [cooperative  learning-embedded assessment] helped me to prepare more than I used to prepare.' (P9, undisclosed gender, February 2019)

The  ability  to identify  learning  needs implies  that  problem  areas  are identified,  which  relates  to  the  identification  of  one's  strengths  and weaknesses. Several students stated that cooperative learning-embedded assessment supported them in identifying their learning needs:

'The assessment helped me realise my knowledge capability, and how much I know and also guided me in terms of areas that I need to put more effort in.' (P6, undisclosed gender, February 2019)

## Another student said:

'Through assessment, I noticed my mistakes and identified my problem areas.' (P44, undisclosed gender, February 2019)

A  couple  of  students  also  mentioned  that  identifying  strengths  and weaknesses  is  an  important  aspect  of  cooperative  learning-embedded assessment, and one of the students said:

'The assessment helped me know my areas of strength and weakness and what I need to do to improve my performance.' (P32, undisclosed gender, February 2019)

The  participatory  nature  of  cooperative  learning-embedded  assessment and the immediate feedback mechanism might have given the participating first-year  LIFE  students the chance to take charge of their learning and progress. Several of the students stated that assessments that included cooperative  learning  had  a  positive  influence  on  their  development  as potential teachers, and one said:

'These  assessments  helped  me  to  figure  out  the  type  of  teacher  I  want  to become.' (P51, undisclosed gender, February 2019)

The  following  response  indicates  that  cooperative  learning-embedded assessment contributed to students becoming aware of different ways of assessment:

'We were exposed to different ways of assessment so that we would be able to use it in our own class environment.' (P49, undisclosed gender, February 2019)

In general, the positive effect cooperative learning-embedded assessment had  on  participating  students'  learning  process,  learning  progress  and

examination preparation could be attributed to students' positive attitudes towards assessment. Students might be inspired to use comparable tests in their classrooms in the future as a result. Several students mentioned the significance  of  the  participatory  nature  of  the  group  work  component (i.e. cooperative learning) of cooperative learning-embedded assessment, even though two students said they learn better independently. One of them said:

'[It]  [cooperative  learning]  was  very  advantageous  because  we  can  discuss some  of  the  aspects  we  do  not  fully  understand.'  (P31,  undisclosed  gender, February 2019)

## Another student said:

'The tests we wrote together really helped me a lot, because I could learn from the other people so many times. Two heads are always better than one!' (P70, undisclosed gender, February 2019)

The cooperative learning component of cooperative learning-embedded assessment gave participating students the opportunity to learn from one another. One student said:

'In a way, I was able to learn in different ways and learn from fellow students.' (P9, undisclosed gender, February 2019)

Furthermore,  the  cooperative  learning component  of  cooperative learning-embedded  assessment  enabled  students  to  develop  social skills, and some students acknowledged the improvement in their social skills:

'It [cooperative learning-embedded assessment] developed my skills in learning to work with others.' (P43, undisclosed gender, February 2019)

Cooperative learning-embedded assessment was said to have aided in the development  of  self-  and  peer-assessment  skills.  The  participatory  and cooperative nature of cooperative learning-embedded assessment might have fostered the development of these skills.

Several  students  indicated  that  the  purpose  of  cooperative  learningembedded assessment was to self-assess . Participating students said:

'To assess the learners' knowledge and understanding of the LIFE module.' (P80, undisclosed gender, February 2019)

'It [cooperative learning-embedded assessment] has helped me to reflect on my work so that I can learn from my mistakes and produce better quality work in future.' (P75, undisclosed gender, February 2019)

Another student said that the purpose of cooperative learning-embedded assessment is to:

'Check our understanding of the content [LIFE module] thus far.' (P5, undisclosed gender, February 2019)

Within  cooperative  learning-embedded  assessment,  testing  knowledge may be linked to SDL skills as students diagnose their learning needs and not  necessarily  measure  learning  as  a  product.  Next,  we  conclude  by discussing our findings from the data generated.

## Discussion

The  findings  of  this  study  show  that  cooperative  learning-embedded assessment has a significant perceived value in improving students' learning experiences, and it enables them to take ownership of and responsibility for their  learning  process  and  progress  as  self-directed  learners.  Several  key themes  emerged  from  the  qualitative  analysis  of  students'  responses, shedding light on the multifaceted benefits and outcomes of incorporating cooperative learning-embedded assessment within the educational context.

Students consistently stated that participating in cooperative learningembedded assessment  sparked  their  curiosity,  motivation  and  sense  of encouragement to learn, which suggests that the participatory nature of cooperative  learning  activities,  combined  with  assessment  components, acts  as  a  motivator,  igniting  students'  intrinsic  desire  to  participate  and invest actively in their learning process. The  assessment  approach incorporating  cooperative  learning  encourages  students  to  explore  and learn. It fosters a sense of ownership over their educational journey as selfdirected learners and links to the principles of a student-centred curriculum and cooperative learning, where students are encouraged to participate actively in their learning process (Johnson &amp; Johnson 2021).

One interesting finding is that participating students perceived cooperative learning-embedded assessment as a mechanism for providing immediate and constructive feedback. This feedback mechanism not only allowed students to identify learning gaps and needs but also guided their progress  via  continuous  feed-forward.  Providing  immediate  feedback  is crucial for effective learning (Fu et al. 2022). Incorporating feedback within cooperative  learning-embedded  assessment  allowed  the  participating students to refine their understanding and to improve their learning based on the timely and constructive dialogic nature of the feedback mechanism. The fact that two students indicated that more feedback was needed might be an indication that even more emphasis should be placed on feedback in the planning of the cooperative learning-embedded assessment.

Cooperative learning-embedded assessment has improved the learning experiences of the participating first-year LIFE students by encouraging critical thinking and knowledge application and by refining problem-solving skills, eventually  enhancing  their  SDL  skills. Students  reported  that cooperative learning-embedded assessment pushed them to think more

deeply and more critically about the learning content, which resulted in improved comprehension and retention. Although this finding is aligned with literature on cooperative learning (see Jalinus, Syahril &amp; Nabawi 2019; Zhang &amp; Chen 2021), it brings new insight into how assessment practices can be implemented to develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills and eventually enhance students' SDL skills.

The participative nature of cooperative learning-embedded assessment allowed  the  participating  students  to  interact  with  their  peers,  share perspectives and learn from one another. The cooperative learning component encouraged these students to collaborate,  communicate  and view  their  peers  as  valuable  resources,  which  aided  in  developing  social skills. This finding is consistent with the notion that, within a student-centred learning environment, students are not only autonomous learners but also able  to  use  the  assistance  of  others  to  achieve  their  learning  objectives (Trinidad  2020).  According  to  the  responses  of  participating  students, cooperative  learning-embedded  assessment  cultivated  their  ability  to identify learning needs, select appropriate learning strategies and track their progress. These abilities indicate students' growing agency and autonomy over  their  learning  endeavours  (Knowles  1975).  The  assessment  tasks embedded in cooperative learning gave the participating students a platform to  take  ownership  of  their  learning  process  by  actively  diagnosing  gaps, seeking appropriate resources and adjusting their learning strategies.

The  participating  students  recognised  the  broader  implications  of cooperative  learning-embedded  assessment  for  their  future  roles  as educators,  which  was  significant.  They  saw  the  approach  as  a  useful pedagogical  tool  and  a  way  to  expose  them  to  various  assessment strategies. This perception highlights the potential aftermath of incorporating cooperative learning principles in assessment tasks, as the students envisioned similar strategies being used in their future classrooms.

In conclusion, the findings of this study show that cooperative learningembedded assessment is a valuable pedagogical tool that enables students to be actively and socially involved in the learning process. The participatory and  collaborative  nature  of  cooperative  learning-embedded  assessment encourages  active  participation,  fosters  critical  thinking  and  empowers students  to  take  ownership  of  their  learning  journey  and  thus  be  selfdirected. Educators could create an environment that enhances knowledge acquisition and nurtures students' SDL skills, preparing them for lifelong learning and future roles as autonomous, empowered learners by integrating cooperative learning-embedded assessment within educational contexts. Cooperative learning-embedded assessment is a successful pedagogical methodology  for  the  higher  education  context.  In  the  next  section,  we discuss some recommendations from our research findings.

## Limitations of this study

Following  the  review  of  the  literature,  the  empirical  research  and  the research results, a few factors were considered.

It was unfortunate that the intervention had to be so brief. Extending the  intervention  to  more  than  one  semester  could  have  provided  the researchers with even richer qualitative data because participants would have  had  more  opportunities  to  experience  the  cooperative  learningembedded assessment and might have been more responsive to the openended questions.

## Recommendations

The research findings and subsequent discussion highlight the critical role of  cooperative  learning-embedded  assessment  in  fostering  a  studentcentred curriculum. Several recommendations are made based on these findings to assist educators in effectively implementing this approach:

Cooperative learning-embedded assessment has to be proactively and explicitly  integrated  into  curriculum  design.  Educators  could  promote active  student  engagement  and  a  deeper  understanding  of  content  by embedding assessment activities strategically within cooperative learning environments. This integration is consistent with the principles of a studentcentred curriculum in which students are encouraged to participate actively in their learning.

Creating  assessment  activities  that  are  embedded  in  cooperative learning can stimulate students' curiosity and intrinsic motivation. Therefore, it is suggested that real-world scenarios, problem-solving tasks and openended  questions  to  encourage  students  to  explore,  question  and  seek solutions  collaboratively  are  incorporated  within  cooperative  learningembedded assessment  tasks.  This  approach  is  consistent  with  studentcentred  pedagogy  because  it  encourages  students  to  participate  in meaningful  learning  experiences  driven  by  their  interests  and  enquiries. Educators can create assessments that inspire intrinsic motivation purposefully because cooperative learning-embedded assessment increases students' motivation and sense of responsibility for their learning. Assessments relating to practical situations, individual interests and group problem-solving could increase students' enthusiasm for learning objectives.  Instructors  have  to  also  emphasise  the  connection  between assessment  outcomes  and  personal  development  to  inspire  students  to take responsibility for their learning.

Within the cooperative learning-embedded assessment process, prioritise providing  timely  and  constructive  feedback.  Ensuring  that

feedback is  not  only  directed  at  students  by  educators  but  that  it  also encourages peer feedback and self-assessment is consistent with studentcentred  and  SDL  skills,  which  encourages  active  reflection  and  selfregulation. Immediate feedback mechanisms could help students improve their SDL skills by allowing them to adapt their understanding and learning strategies constantly.

Through cooperative learning-embedded assessment, create opportunities for collaborative learning and peer interaction. Include group discussions, problem-solving activities and shared learning experiences to encourage students to learn from one another. Educators could cultivate a cooperative learning culture that mirrors the dynamics of a student-centred curriculum  by  using  the  principles  of  positive  interdependence  and promotive  interaction.  Such  peer  interactions  are  crucial  for  immediate feedback practices, which can ultimately have an influence on students' ability to identify learning needs, an important SDL characteristic.

Students deepen their understanding and develop the cognitive skills required  for  SDL  within  a  student-centred  curriculum  by  engaging  in higher-order  thinking  and  problem-solving.  Therefore,  educators  could create assessment tasks that are embedded in cooperative learning and emphasise the application of knowledge and critical thinking. To this end, the  inclusion  of  tasks  that  require  students  to  collaborate  to  analyse, synthesise and evaluate information could be considered.

Educators could contribute to developing self-directed, lifelong learners who are ready to thrive in student-centred educational environments by encouraging this sense of autonomy and future-oriented thinking. Students could be encouraged to consider the broader implications of cooperative learning-integrated  assessment  for  their  future  educator  roles.  Further, encouraging  students  to  consider  the  strategies  used  and  how  similar approaches can be incorporated into their own future teaching practices could be considered.

Providing professional development opportunities for educators, centred  on  integrating  cooperative  learning-embedded  assessment  into the student-centred curriculum, could be considered. Providing workshops, training  sessions  and resources to educators can assist in the design of effective collaborative assessment activities. This assistance can provide educators with the tools and strategies they need to create enriching SDL experiences that are consistent with the larger goals of a student-centred approach.

Finally, the findings and subsequent discussion highlight the symbiotic relationship  between  cooperative  learning-embedded  assessment  and  a student-centred curriculum. Educators could use the power of cooperative

learning-embedded assessment to create collaborative learning environments and empower students to shape their educational journeys actively within the student-centred paradigm  by  implementing  the recommendations above. This integration not only improves educational outcomes but also helps to develop self-directed learners who are prepared to thrive in a rapidly changing educational landscape.

Collaboration between institutions and scholars is necessary to understand  the  complex  assessment  dynamics  of  cooperative  learning fully.  Investigating  the  effects  on  various  learner  demographics,  figuring out the best ratio of collaborative and individual assessment components and looking at technical solutions enabling seamless integration are all part of this.

## Conclusion

In this chapter, the data analysis highlighted the concrete advantages that students  see  in  the  assessment  context  embedded  within  cooperative learning. These findings provide helpful insights for educational professionals  and  institutions  looking  to  develop  more  engaging  and student-centred learning experiences. Educators could create a collaborative, SDL environment that encourages motivation and enables students  to  be  at  the  centre  of  their  learning  process.  The  potential  of cooperative  learning-embedded  assessment  can  be  unlocked  through thoughtful implementation and ongoing improvement to empower students, encourage active participation and help construct a dynamic and student-centred educational future.

In conclusion, our investigation of a student-centred curriculum focusing on  cooperative  learning-embedded  assessment  highlights  the  central move concerning cultivating active commitment and collaboration. In the next  chapter,  the  focus  turns  to  digital  education  by  introducing  blockbased programming. This transition is indispensable in accepting how preservice teachers develop decisive SDL skills and self-efficacy within digital microworlds,  flooring  the  way  for  a  comprehensive  investigation  of innovative teaching methodologies that align with contemporary education's requests. The forthcoming conversation unravels the intricacies of integrating technology into pedagogy and its transformative influence on future educators.

## Abstract

This  chapter  aims  to  introduce  block-based  programming  (BBP)  and explore  skill  development  and  self-efficacy  in  digital  microworlds  that may  encourage  pre-service  teachers'  self-directed  learning  (SDL).  The Fourth  Industrial  Revolution  (4IR)  symbolises  an  era  of  technological advancement  to  which  higher  education  institutions  are  expected  to

respond appropriately. Integrating educational robotics in higher education has been proven to enhance students' higher-order thinking, motivation and enjoyment effectively. Educational robotics therefore has great  potential  to  assist  pre-service  teachers  effectively  in  learning, enhancing  their critical thinking and  problem-solving  abilities and promoting their SDL skills. Constructionism guided this research, and we conducted  a  general  qualitative  study.  One  cohort  of  Postgraduate Certificate in Education distance learning students majoring in Information Technology participated over three weeks. Students worked online and were expected to develop certain activities as future teachers using the open-source Microsoft MakeCode visual programming environment for micro:bit. 6 Data  collection  consisted  of  screenprints  of  block-based programme  segments,  short videos of programme  execution  and individual reflective reports regarding students' experiences. Data were analysed manually using descriptive coding. Results indicated that the pre-service  education  students  initially  experienced  some  challenges. However,  students  developed  critical  thinking,  problem-solving  and various  coding  skills,  such  as  error  detection  and  debugging  abilities. Moreover, students' views on self-efficacy changed; they were motivated and  developed  confidence  and  persistence.  Students  also  enhanced self-management  and  responsibility  in  learning  and  developed  several SDL skills.

## Introduction

The former chapter (cf. Chapter 7) advocated for a more student-centred curriculum. This chapter discussed introducing block-based programming (BBP) by exploring pre-service teachers' skill development and self-efficacy in digital microworlds. The link between these two chapters is their shared emphasis on methodologies that empower students to be actively involved in  their  learning  journey.  Integrating digital technology in education is a prerequisite for developing 21st-century skills to prepare students for future challenges (Ramaila &amp; Molwele 2022; Vidal-Silva et al. 2020; Yildiz, Ates Cobanoglu &amp; Kisla 2020). Artificial intelligence (AI), associated with the Fourth  Industrial  Revolution  (4IR),  requires  developing  new  knowledge and solving challenging real-world problems. Essential skills highlighted by the World Economic Forum (WEF 2020, p. 6) include technological design and use; analytical and critical thinking; innovation and complex problemsolving;  and  abilities  like  initiative,  flexibility,  resilience  and  emotional intelligence. Considering the demands and opportunities of the 4IR, it is

imperative to provide for such skill development in educational settings, for example, when introducing students to digital microworlds.

The  so-called  microworlds  were  first  mentioned  by  Seymour  Papert (1980, pp. 117, 118) in a study where children explored ideas and discovered learning opportunities. Microworlds are seen as rich learning contexts for blending 'powerful ideas' with high-level thinking and knowledge construction (Papert 1980, pp. 11, 12, 126). Costa et al. (2020) emphasised Papert's view that microworlds have the following attributes, namely, the creation  of  activities  to  provide  for  expected  knowledge  acquisition, manipulation of objects as a means of learning and the use of concepts (e.g. variables) to be outlined explicitly within the microworld environment. Consequently, digital microworlds have intellectual and personal value and allow real-world problem-solving, computational thinking (CT), innovation and  social  interaction  (Da  Silva  2020;  Dhakulkar  &amp;  Olivier  2021;  Papert 1980). Scholars such as Aono et al. (2017) consider BBP as an excellent way to introduce students to the digital culture of microworlds. Block-based programming can be used to develop skills such as collaborative problemsolving, decision-making and critical thinking (Da Silva 2020; Perin, Dos Silva &amp; Valentim 2022; Vinayakumar, Soman &amp; Menon 2018).

Penprase  (2018)  emphasises  several  skills  to  deal  with  complexity, adaptability and the importance of self-directed learning (SDL) for the 4IR. He claims:

[ T ]he 4IR […] places an extremely high premium on faculty development and curriculum renewal, as well as the mandate to develop students who can think and reinvent themselves within the changing world. (pp. 223-224)

The current research, therefore, explored how integrating BBP influences pre-service teachers' self-efficacy and encourages essential skill development in digital microworlds. The following questions guided the research:

- 1. Which skills are developed through block-based programming?
- 2.  What are pre-service teachers' views on their self-efficacy with blockbased programming?
- 3.  How does the incorporation of microworlds encourage the development of self-directed learning?

## Block-based programming and skill development

This section explores various aspects related to BBP. Using theoretical and conceptual frameworks offers a structured foundation by delineating the main aspects of this chapter.

## Constructionist approach

In 1980, Papert introduced his views on learning (constructionism) related to Piaget's constructivist theory (see Stager 2016). Constructionism is a theory  that  emphasises  learning  when  students  generate  knowledge independently and develop objects that can be shared by others (Xerou, Papadima-Sophocleous  &amp;  Parmaxi  2016).  It  has  been  suggested  that actively  building  a  shared  artefact  -  such  as  a  programme  or  model  or implementing an idea - is the best approach for knowledge construction (Jackson &amp; Klobas 2008). Papert (1980) considered microworlds primarily as a means for discovery and putting constructionist educational principles into practice. However, Girvan and Savage (2019) emphasise that simply creating artefacts is not considered a constructionist endeavour as active engagement  and  evidence  of  building  and  rebuilding  are  required  to develop  a  deeper  understanding  while  working  on  artefacts.  Moreover, Kahn and Winters (2021, p. 1132) emphasise the importance of exposing and challenging students using 'constructionist microworlds' where educators  or  teachers  facilitate  'them  to  move  outside  of  themselves'. Digital microworlds are associated with the use of BBP and also allow for the enhancement of CT.

## Block-based programming and computational thinking

Block-based programming languages have been around since the 1980s and  belong  to  a  category  of  visual  programming  languages  where  the programmes are executed graphically rather than textually (Aivaloglou &amp; Hermans  2016; Weintrop 2019). Block-based programming  involves dragging and dropping statements, expressed as blocks, onto a script area to develop a programme to construct animated games and stories (Barone 2020; Köksaloğlu 2022). Additionally, BBP uses visual tools to introduce non-technical people to programming aspects (e.g. iteration) and allows for creating basic programmes despite a lack of prior knowledge regarding conventional programming languages (Corral, Fronza &amp; Mikkonen 2021). Block-based programming also reduces the learning curve, as there is no need  to  pay  attention  to  programming  syntax  as  required  in  high-level programming languages (Andersen, Mørch &amp; Litherland 2022). Through BBP, students can easily and more readily experiment after seeing their coding attempts (programme output) (Noone &amp; Mooney 2018).

Students  are  encouraged  to  approach  real-world  problems  and promote  their  creative  thinking  in  BBP  contexts,  which  assist  in  the development  of  essential  problem-solving  skills  and  allow  them  to practice tackling issues systematically (Çakıroğlu et al. 2018; Çakıroğlu &amp;

The use of digital microworlds enables students to develop computational thinking skills (Çakıroğlu &amp; Mumcu 2020; Del Olmo-Muñoz, Cózar-Gutiérrez &amp; González-Calero 2020; Pérez-Marín et al. 2020; Rose et al. 2020).

Mumcu  2020;  Weintrop  2019).  In  addition,  BBP  increases  students' learning motivation and enables them to interact with one another while thinking  critically,  creatively  and  cooperatively  (Broll  et  al.  2018;  Rose, Habgood &amp; Jay 2020; Sentance, Waite &amp; Kallia 2019). Microsoft MakeCode 7 is  an  open-source  visual  programming  tool  for  micro:bit  that  allows learners and students to build programmes by combining several coloured instruction blocks (see Figure 8.1). Scholars emphasise that microworlds,

such  as  NetLogo,  Turtle  Blocks  and  Scratch,  are  valuable  for  learning programming skills (Dhakulkar &amp; Olivier 2021).

Computational thinking refers to the ability to be creative, think critically, solve  open-ended problems and reflect on one's thinking (Wing 2006). Formally, CT involves aspects such as thinking in terms of patterns (pattern recognition),  compiling  algorithms,  focusing  on  essential  information (abstraction) and decomposing a problem into simpler parts (Wing 2006).

Computational thinking is also based on the assumptions of computer science  that  are  essential  for  solving  interdisciplinary  problems  where active  learning  is  required  (Saad  &amp;  Zainudin  2022).  Moreover,  CT  is becoming  essential  in  educational  curricula  to  prepare  students  for solving open-ended problems (Madariaga et al. 2023). It is important to plan for the integration of BBP and CT in secondary and tertiary curricula. Because of the demands of the 4IR and essential skill development, such curricula aim to develop learning autonomy, self-direction, creativity and problem-solving  skills.  In  this  regard,  Penprase  (2018)  highlights  the development of self and identity and the importance of SDL for AI. Hsu, Abelson  and  Van  Brummelen  (2022)  implemented  a  curriculum  for  AI using  experiential  learning  to  introduce  students  to  BBP  and  evaluate their  effective  learning  and  performance  over  six  weeks.  Their  results indicated that some students performed better in enhancing their learning and  understanding  of  CT  aspects.  It  is  therefore  essential  that  BBP  is introduced in teachers' training.

## Integrating block-based programming into pre-service teachers' training

Educational robotics 8  (ER) enables pre-service teachers to be involved in a playful environment and serves as a motivation for developing skills such as CT and solving complex problems (Barak &amp; Assal 2018; Casler-Failing 2018; Fegely 2020; Jaipal-Jamani &amp; Angeli 2017; Kucuk &amp; Sisman 2018). As a result, several courses have been designed to introduce robotics and programming  to  pre-service  teachers.  The  aim  is  to  juxtapose  ER  and pedagogical approaches to assist in developing the relevant knowledge and skills in pre-service teachers (Kucuk &amp; Sisman 2018). However, some challenges when introducing BBP have been reported (see Sisman &amp; Kucuk 2019). Pre-service teachers, for instance, encountered design challenges and  consequently  showed  a  lack  of  enthusiasm  for  developing  robots

8. ER is an interdisciplinary environment that requires coding, and which uses robots and certain components with the aim to enhance learners' and students' development of high-order thinking and essential skills development for the 4IR.

(Kucuk &amp; Sisman 2018). Another issue highlighted was debugging, which pre-service  teachers  considered  time-consuming  and  often  frustrating (Kim et al. 2018). Nevertheless, the exposure of participating pre-service teachers to coding and robotics increased their confidence in their ability to learn and impart programming languages (see Jaipal-Jamani &amp; Angeli 2017). Additionally, pre-service teachers gained coding skills and improved their  metacognitive  abilities  by  using  Scratch  to  address  mathematicsbased programming tasks (Daher et al. 2020). Block-based programming also  enhanced  prospective  teachers'  coding  abilities  and  demonstrated how  coding  could  help  students  build  transversal  skills  (see  Ouahbi, Darhmaoui &amp; Kaddari 2022; Papadakis et al. 2019). For example, BBP is considered an appropriate environment and tool for teaching mathematics that  requires  future  teachers  to  draw  on  their  knowledge  of  pedagogy (Gleasman  &amp;  Kim  2018).  Gleasman  and  Kim  (2018,  p.  59)  outline  three guidelines  to  assist  pre-service  teachers  in  the  use  of  BBP  to  teach mathematics:

- · expanding future teachers' skills by focusing on essential programming concepts and mathematics abilities
- · facilitating pre-service teachers' integration of BBP to enhance mathematical  learning  and  conceptual  understanding  (e.g.  lesson planning)
- · facilitating and  instructing  pre-service  teachers  to  relate  CT  and mathematics  concepts  'through  a  teaching  lens'  (e.g.  mathematics knowledge for teaching).

Timur et al. (2021) claim that pre-service teachers believed learning BBP and  utilising the Scratch  environment  would  be  beneficial  to  their professional development. Block-based programming consequently assisted in obtaining new ideas for learning science using digital microworlds for the animation of experiments (see Timur et al. 2021).

## Block-based programming and students' self-efficacy

The social cognitive theory, coined by Albert Bandura (1977), refers to selfefficacy as the confidence a person has, and it involves personal beliefs regarding his or her ability to perform certain actions to achieve a goal. Self-efficacy influences an individual's ability to adapt to certain circumstances and emphasises the importance of persistence in challenging environments (Bandura 1977). Regarding students' self-efficacy in online environments,  Wang  et  al.  (2022)  emphasise  that  it  allows  for  studentcentred learning opportunities and similarly requires student engagement and commitment in their learning, thus being self-directed. Some factors

that  may  promote  successful  online  learning  are  responsible  learning, technical abilities, self-esteem, students' attitudes and self-efficacy (Bahçekapili &amp; Karaman 2020).

In terms of BBP, scholars claim that self-efficacy perceptions are crucial in programming tasks (see Öztuzcu, Öztürk &amp; Mısırlı 2022). Ramazanoğlu (2021)  found  that  when  students  actively  engaged  in  coding  activities associated  with  digital  microworlds,  their  opinion  of  their  self-efficacy regarding their CT skills improved, and their concerns about computers decreased. In addition, students found BBP environments simple because of  the  use  of  block-based  codes,  the  drag-and-drop  gestures  and  the simplicity of language browsing (Weintrop &amp; Wilensky 2015). Block-based programming enables students to learn programming principles effectively by  breaking  them  down  into  sections  and  organising  them  logically (Kraleva, Kralev &amp; Kostadinova 2019).

Kraleva et al. (2019) further argue that BBP gives students a sense of accomplishment and boosts their level of confidence. Scholars claim that the benefits of BBP, which include ease of use, motivation to learn and the ability to develop programming skills, enable students to be satisfied with their academic success (Erol &amp; Kurt 2017; Marcelino et al. 2018; Papadakis et al. 2019; Yukselturk &amp; Altiok 2017). On the other hand, Adsay et al. (2020) found that students' evaluations of their self-efficacy concerning BBP were low, while their levels of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM)  and  CT  proficiency  were  moderate  when  their  self-efficacy observations were related to BBP and CT skills. Therefore, students' selfefficacy levels concerning BBP were decisive in how they perceived their self-efficacy concerning CT skills.

## Block-based programming and self-directed learning

The accelerated and inspiring technological developments require guidance regarding responsibility and 'identity within the 4IR' (Penprase 2018, p. 222). Consequently, curricula must be responsive and allow for concurrent skill development. Penprase (2018) argues that adaptability and SDL are central to the required skills for the 4IR. In other words, students are expected to adapt  to  change,  be  responsible  and  develop  skills  accordingly  to  be relevant for the future. Olivier (2022, p. 37) emphasises the importance of equipping students with skills to be prepared for a 'dynamic educational context', using various modalities of learning and developing SDL abilities. These abilities are essential to function in the 4IR. Schwab (2016, p. 97) emphasises that the 4IR impacts in various ways on individuals in terms of

'not only changing what we do but also who we are'. In the first chapter of this book (cf. Chapter 1), SDL refers to an individual's ability to set specific goals,  identify  particular  learning  needs,  and  direct  and  evaluate  their learning processes (Knowles 1975). Robinson and Persky (2020) mention that students who engage in SDL establish goals, decide how progress will be evaluated, plan the sequence and structure of activities, select relevant resources, and get the necessary feedback. Self-directed learning features, such as being goal-driven, curious, taking responsibility for tasks, having initiative,  being  independent,  having  self-confidence  and  having  selfefficacy, are crucial for a complex and challenging world (Guglielmino 2013; Knowles 1975).

Block-based programming environments encourage SDL through experimentation  and  group  work  (Maloney  et  al.  2010).  In  addition,  SDL assists  students  in  promoting  their  CT  skills  in  BBP  environments  and provides  supportive  tools  to  develop  21st-century  capabilities  (Fadhillah, Budiyanto &amp; Hatta 2023; Zhou et al. 2022). Block-based programming also helps  students  to  be  creative  and  develop  their  capacity  for  solving challenging  problems  (Hu,  Chen  &amp;  Su  2021;  Wei  et  al.  2021).  Digital microworlds  positively  influence  students'  understanding  of  their  own learning  (Ferrer-Mico,  Prats-Fernàndez  &amp;  Redo-Sanchez  2012).  The  selfchecking and self-debugging strategies related to CT help students enhance their learning through unplugged coding activities (Threekunprapa &amp; Yasri 2020). Moreover, these strategies encourage the development of CT, which contributes to addressing open-ended real-world problems.

## Methodology

A  generic  qualitative  methodology  was  employed  in  this  chapter.  This methodology  was  suitable  as  it  focused  on  students'  experiences  and reflections  regarding  their  introduction  to  BBP  and  CT.  The  ability  to construct their knowledge highlighted the importance of constructionist microworlds as relevant to this research.

## Study context

One cohort of 33 Postgraduate Certificate in Education (PGCE) distance learning students enrolled, of whom 20 consented to participate. Students were required to have a qualification comprising computer courses and programming on at least second-year level. The research was approved by the Faculty of Education Ethics Committee and the University Research Data Gatekeeper Committee (RGDC). All activities were performed on the

eFundi  (Sakai)  learning  management  system  (LMS).  The  online  e-guide comprised the following study units:

- · Study Unit 1: Digital knowledge and skills in praxis
- · Study Unit 2: Assessment in digital technology
- · Study Unit 3: Mastering of the touch-typing technique
- · Study Unit 4: Introduction to programming and robotics
- · Study Unit 5: Database design
- · Study Unit 6: Web design with HTML.

Although participants had completed some courses as part of their degree, this postgraduate course aimed at preparing pre-service students for the Senior Phase (Grades 7 to 9) and developing essential competencies as future digital technology teachers for the 4IR. This also involved didactics and the methodology for teaching and learning. Regarding Study Unit 4, students  were  introduced  to  the  principles  of  CT  and  the  MakeCode programming environment for micro:bit, such as buttons for programme execution,  sound,  shake,  music,  loops,  logic,  mathematics  functions  and variables.

## Assessment of the assignment

The  course  involved  continuous  assessment  and  no  examination  was written.  Students  submitted  assignments  about  each  study  unit.  The programming  and  robotics  study  unit assignment  was  carried out individually and involved the following, as shown in Table 8.1. Students had to  demonstrate  sound  mastery  of  programming  skills,  challenges  and responsibilities using the MakeCode environment.

## Data collection and analysis

Data  collection  consisted  of  evidence  regarding  individual  students' activities such as screen prints of BBPs, short videos to show programme execution and students' reflective reports regarding their experiences on

BBP and digital microworlds. The data were manually coded. Descriptive or attribute coding was used to analyse the data (see Saldaña 2016). This coding  method  assisted  the  authors  in  organising  the  data,  identifying patterns, facilitating the discussion on the data and condensing the data, among others. The findings are outlined in the next section.

## Findings

Integrated findings from students' programmes, videos and reflections are presented in Table 8.2, Table 8.3, Table 8.4 and Table 8.5.

TABLE 8.2: Selected responses regarding students' skill development with block-based programming (BBP).

## Theme 1: Skill development with BBP

'Creating a game require critical thinking and problem solving […] also increase my coding aspects and skills' (P1, gender undisclosed, date unknown).

- 'I made sure that the game performs all its functions and those players don't experience any errors […] the blocks move in the right directions and do not clash making it different to move around' (P10, gender undisclosed, date unknown).

'Working with logic and loops, inserting LEDs, adding music and inserting a text box was the most fun part of my game […]' (P14, gender undisclosed, date unknown).

- 'It was easy to declare variables and use them but the use of for loop and if statements was a big challenge. I had to watch some videos' (P24, gender undisclosed, date unknown).

'I really struggled to come up with an idea for a game but eventually settled on something educational […], fun and evoke critical thinking. I had to separate the logic conditionals from the 'while' loops. It is really satisfying seeing a game you developed come to life' (P30, gender undisclosed, date unknown).

- 'I also found it challenging with limited inputs […] I overcome this by adding in a random function' (P33, gender undisclosed, date unknown).

## Theme 2: Development of self-efficacy

'I had no motivation to start at all […] I felt anxious about this assignment […] Then I just started reading and doing coding […] my idea changed after a few online tutorials […] Visual representation, for me personally, is good […] rather than coding in a normal coding language like C#.' (P2, gender undisclosed, date unknown)

'Microbit is a totally new platform for me and initially I was sceptical and had anxiety attacks […] I then started to enquire over the internet and I found interesting information.' (P14, gender undisclosed, date unknown)

'It all looked a little too complicated […] Luckily the scaffolding of activities based on different aspects of micro:bit helped to ease some of the confusion.' (P30, gender undisclosed, date unknown)

- 'I was afraid of it [assignment] and thought it's very complicated. But once I started (with the help of videos and micro:bit tutorials) it was actually easily to pick up. I realised it is indeed (very) fun to code.' (P33, gender undisclosed, date unknown)

## Theme 3: Experiences and challenges with BBP

'The activities were so challenging […] using logic, loops and mathematical functions. When creating a game I got exposed to many features in the MakeCoke blocks.' (P1, gender undisclosed, date unknown)

'You must think incredibly carefully as to the output and functionality of the game' '[Initially] I found it difficult to code with the blocks […] I found the coding framework very interesting and good to work with pupils in schools.' (P2, gender undisclosed, date unknown)

'I was however excited to see how the block coding interface worked, wondering whether it would make coding more accessible to a younger audience so that they could concentrate on the ideas behind programming not getting possibly tripped up by syntax.' (P5, gender undisclosed, date unknown)

'My other concern was that […] micro:bit coding seemed to be more event-driven based on the input of pushing the A or B buttons etc.' (P5, gender undisclosed, date unknown)

'Thinking about a creative problem formulation on developing a programme using micro:bit […] was a challenge because I had to think out of the box and come up with a different angle of focus'. (P8, gender undisclosed, date unknown)

'Overall, this was a wonderful experience, I think that I would love to teach robotics someday when I become a teacher.' (P29, gender undisclosed, date unknown)

## Theme 4: Development of self-directed learning abilities

'There were difficulties but I went back to the tutorial […] I became motivated and continue developing with a positive mindset.' (P1, gender undisclosed, date unknown)

'I had to take the responsibility for rewriting the code and restructure my initial planning when I started to create the game […] I had to work through various videos and coding with the tutorials online to get a better understanding to make sense of it. When I finally started doing it on my own, there was light at the end of the tunnel […] By involving games in the learning, the learners become more actively involved and give their inputs.' (P2, gender undisclosed, date unknown)

'I approached this assignment with a confidence […] I see understanding and experiencing the eventdriven paradigm as an area for growth.' (P5, gender undisclosed, date unknown)

'The thinking, brainstorming, and comparing different kinds of ideas became interesting […] having to compile deeper understanding […] create a problem formulation creatively […] and I have accomplished my responsibilities even though I encountered challenges in the process.' (P8, gender undisclosed, date unknown)

'[T]he more I practiced, the more knowledge I got and the more confidence I developed […] it kept on showing errors and forced me to start the function over and over again until it was perfect […] if I had this kind of exposure during my high school years I could have been one of the best computer scientists in varsity.' (P14, gender undisclosed, date unknown)

'I carefully worked through my code over and over to figure out where the problems were […] Now the error message was gone […] It was very satisfying to figure it out and to see the game playing out as I wanted.' (P33, gender undisclosed, date unknown)

The quotes are reproduced verbatim and without any language editing. The following themes emerged from the data:

- · skill development with BBP
- · development of self-efficacy
- · experiences and challenges with BBP
- · development of SDL abilities.

As indicated in Table 8.2, students developed several programming skills such  as  working  with  loops,  declaring  variables  and  applying  logical thinking while working with micro:bit.

Regardless  of  students'  negative  feelings,  they  were  interested  and enjoyed  the  gaming  task  (Table  8.3).  Some  responses  relating  to  their experiences are outlined in Table 8.4.

Participants were exposed to several features of BBP, e.g., students were introduced to logic, iterative statements and mathematical functions in the BBP environment to solve problems. Although the students encountered several difficulties, they gained a deeper understanding of the programming environment.

The  students  were  required  to  develop  a  game  comprising  various activities such as addressing certain objectives, executing the BBP code and demonstrating sound mastery of the programming concepts. Participants planned this activity with a clear goal in mind, approached it with confidence and searched for relevant resources. Such activities are associated  with  the  qualities  of  a  self-directed  learner  where  students manage their thinking processes.

## Discussion of the findings

The first  question  explored the skills  that  were  developed  through  BBP . Although  students  initially  experienced  some  challenges,  they  acquired certain  skills  while  developing  their  own  game  (Theme  1).  For  example, they required critical thinking and problem-solving, increased their coding abilities  (P1),  worked  with  logic  and  loops,  used  LEDs  and  added  some music to make the game more interesting. Such skills assisted students to analyse problems, critically discuss possible solutions and make decisions about  the  best  solution.  Consequently,  participants  were  challenged  to apply high-order thinking and construct new knowledge. For example, one student had to add the random function to ensure the game would work as expected  (P33)  and  students  had  to  declare  variables  for  additional functionality in the programming environment (P24).

Although  students  were  not  expected  to  know  different  types  of micro:bit errors (hardware errors and programme access errors), debugging and error prevention (P10) were essential, for example, to ensure that the blocks move in the right directions on the grid and do not clash. Another student  mentioned,  'I  had  to  separate  the  logic  conditionals  from  the 'while' loops. [T]he game quiz worked as intended. It is really satisfying seeing a game you developed come to life' (P30). These findings echo the views  of  Dhakulkar  and  Olivier  (2021)  and  Da  Silva  (2020),  as  they

emphasise that digital microworlds have intellectual and personal value, such as enhancing real-world problem-solving, CT and innovation.

In  terms  of  the  second  research  question,  some  interesting  findings regarding  pre-service  teachers'  views  on  their self-efficacy  with  BBP emerged.  Initially,  most  students  were  sceptical  about  their  abilities  to develop a game in micro:bit (Theme 2). They needed more time to master the coding (P1), were confused (P14) and experienced the assignment as complicated  (P30);  some  students  were  not  motivated  while  others struggled  considerably  with  BBP,  and  yet  others  felt  anxious  about  the assignment (P2, P14). Moreover, participants had a busy schedule (P1, P14) and  were  unfamiliar  with  the  programming  environment  (Theme  3).  As Bahçekapili  and  Karaman  (2020)  noted,  working  in  an  online  learning environment  was  difficult  for  students.  Some  students  struggled  with technical competence  and  were concerned. Self-efficacy influences students' views regarding their abilities, challenging tasks and motivation to complete tasks (Bandura 1977). For three weeks, students developed certain skills and their views regarding their self-efficacy changed. Some examples are:

- · 'I felt depressed' vs 'I found interesting information' (P14).
- · '[I]t can be difficult' vs 'strengthen your resolve and learn to be flexible […] not aiming for perfection' (P27).
- · '[T]here is no way I will be able to do this' vs 'Luckily the scaffolding of activities […] helped to ease some of the confusion' (P30).
- · 'The game needs to be easy to play and understand with a clear goal in mind' (P2).
- · 'I approached this assignment with confidence' (P5).

Regardless  of  participants'  responses  about  their  self-efficacy,  it  was evident that they required specific skills to develop their games and blockbased coding, for example, persistence and critical  thinking  (Table  8.5). These  findings emphasise  scholars' views that coding  offers great experiences  and  develops  confidence  in  programming  activities  (Erol  &amp; Kurt 2017; Marcelino et al. 2018; Papadakis et al. 2019; Yukselturk &amp; Altiok 2017). The findings also support Kraleva et al.'s (2019) views that BBP gives students a sense of accomplishment and boosts their level of confidence, self-perceived  achievements,  development  of  certain  capabilities  and motivation in learning.

Finally, we investigated how the incorporation of microworlds encouraged the development of SDL . Considering the attributes of self-directed learners such as persistence and the ability to develop essential skills for the 4IR, some examples emerged. Students found relevant resources and tutorials, recalled previous knowledge, became motivated and 'continue[d] developing

with  a  positive  mindset'  (P1).  They  also  took  responsibility  for  the  game, changed the initial planning and gained 'a better understanding' (P2). In the age of the 4IR, graduate students must be lifelong and self-directed learners capable of managing  their own  learning processes. Some  students approached the assignment with confidence and identified some gaps and areas for growth (P5) (a characteristic of an SDL learner) (Table 8.5). The gaming task  opened  for  constructing  new  knowledge,  a  deeper  understanding and persistence in completing the task (P8). Students also appreciated the fact that practising makes it easier to complete the game:

'[ T ]he more I practiced, the more knowledge I got and the more confidence I developed […] if I had this kind of exposure during my high school years I could have been one of the best computer scientists in varsity.' (P14)

Participant 29 emphasised persisting and refused to be defeated.

The findings revealed that most participants believed playing the game was highly motivating and improved their understanding of BBP. These findings align with scholars who assert that BBP helps students be creative and develop the capacity for solving challenging problems (Hu et al. 2021; Wei et al. 2021). Self-directed learners are more proficient and independent, can think of novel solutions to problems and see things from new angles. Moreover, findings indicated that programming tasks helped students to construct new knowledge, to be persistent in developing their own game and to develop SDL skills. This finding agrees with Ferrer-Mico et al. (2012), who claim that digital microworlds positively influence students' understanding of their learning process. Furthermore, participants' responses highlight the importance of taking responsibility for learning, being goal-driven, planning activities, constructing knowledge and developing  confidence  regarding  the  incorporation  of  microworlds  to promote their SDL skills. Some recommendations are outlined below.

## Recommendations

Based on this study, the following recommendations were made:

- · Teaching and learning : Detailed planning of activities and scaffolding of students' learning  are  essential  when  learning  BBP  in  online  environments. Furthermore, time management is essential to succeed, and the lecturer needs  to  set  clear  deadlines  in  this  regard.  Educational  institutions should invest in incorporating digital microworlds and BBP into teacher training programmes with the aim of preparing them for the development of essential abilities for the 4IR.
- · Self-efficacy and SDL : Promoting BBP as a learning tool is vital as it may scaffold the enhancement  of  self-efficacy in digital microworlds.

Considering the characteristics of an SDL learner, such as curiosity and persistence, the use of BBP offers opportunities for the development of SDL skills in pre-service teachers.

- · Future research : Integration of BBP in several subjects may be followed with the use of more advanced programming activities with the use of physical robots such as LEGO Mindstorms EV3.

## Conclusion

This chapter highlights the implementation of BBP within education to be a  catalyst  for  cultivating  essential  skill  development  and  self-efficacy  in digital  microworlds.  Although  education  students  initially  encountered several  challenges,  such  as  confusion  and  anxiety,  their  views  on  selfefficacy changed,  and  they  developed  certain  skills. The  ability to systematically address complex problems is an essential skill and BBP has emerged as a means of nurturing such skill development.

Moreover,  pre-service  teachers'  self-directed  abilities  were  enhanced. Students adapted and took ownership of their learning by actively seeking relevant  resources,  engaging  in  independent  research  and  employing appropriate strategies to overcome obstacles. The development of these abilities  embodies  the  essence  of  SDL,  equipping  students  with  crucial skills to navigate the challenging and dynamic landscape of the digital age. Consequently,  integrating  BBP  into  pre-service  teacher  training  offers  a promising way to foster critical skills, self-efficacy and SDL. One limitation is that only one cohort of 20 students participated. Future research should consider follow-up activities that involve more challenging tasks to solve real-world problems and provide for education students to enhance skill development using BBP.

In  closing,  as  we  transform  from  traditional  learning  classrooms  to alternative  learning  environments,  the  link  between  these  pedagogical advancements  and  the  successive  chapter,  'From  classroom  to  home: Unleashing the power of self-directed learning in homeschooling', becomes apparent. The learning journey from structured educational settings to SDL echoes a paradigm alteration in teaching and learning, accentuating the need to empower students and learners beyond traditional teaching and learning restrictions.

include, among others, providing guidance on the best possible ways to manage  and  address  the  impact  of  COVID-19,  homeschooling  and  the future  of  education.  Some  parents  chose  to  enrol  their  children 10   in  a homeschooling  curriculum  to  take  advantage  of  the  benefits  and  to respond  directly to the crisis created by the COVID-19  pandemic. Consequently, self-directed learning (SDL) has become a vital source of inspiration, with many learners 11  being schooled at home instead of being educated under the guidance of a professionally qualified educator. Selfdirected  learning  can  be  described  as  generating  an  encounter  that emboldens individuals (parents as educators or facilitators, and learners 12 ) to make decisions and conclusions concerning the abilities learners want to acquire regarding subject knowledge. On the one hand, SDL may be seen primarily in the experiential setting, for example, when learners encounter something unfamiliar, they must discover suitable learning sources. On the other hand, SDL can also be experienced in co-curricular learning actions as learners explore areas of curiosity. Although SDL may be used in both educational and co-curricular contexts, the abilities required for SDL should be provided and developed in the didactic component of the curriculum. Fostering SDL in learners from a young age may enable them to build SDL skills that  would  add  value  to  any  education  setting,  including  the homeschool setting, over time. Nevertheless, when learners had to stay home during the COVID-19 pandemic, they needed guidance from their parents to continue their educational journeys. The authors of this chapter believe  that  one  cannot  refrain  from  reflecting  on  and  exploring  the importance and value of implementing SDL in a homeschool environment, which is vital to the guidance and support of learners in their educational journeys.

## Introduction

While  the  preceding  chapter  (Chapter  8)  discussed  integrating  blockbased programming and robotics to facilitate SDL in a formal educational context, this chapter (Chapter 9) extends this discussion to the homeschooling environment, showcasing how self-directed learning (SDL) can  be  a  valuable  and  effective  approach  to  alternative  settings.  Both chapters (Chapter 8 and Chapter 9) underline the significance of enabling learners to control their learning process, whether in a traditional classroom or a homeschooling setup. The link between these chapters is a seamless

transition from exploring SDL in the context of educational technology to its application in alternative educational settings.

Knowles (1975) sees SDL as a process by which learners learn to be accountable for their learning by identifying gaps and searching for ways to achieve their educational goals with or without the help of others. Many learners are homeschooled temporarily or indefinitely, making it vital for parents to adopt SDL practices in their homeschool facilitation. By doing so, parents can nurture the learning interests of their children and foster excitement in the learning process (Kern 2020; Thomas &amp; Rodgers 2020). Hence,  SDL  is  an  essential  tool  in  the  homeschooling  environment. Therefore,  to  understand  the  potential  advantages  of  SDL,  for  parents, acting as homeschool facilitators, and homeschool learners, it is crucial to appreciate the rationale for introducing SDL and the methods by which it may be included in the homeschool learning environment.

This conceptual chapter examined why SDL is important in homeschool learning  and  how  parents  view  SDL  as  a  facilitator.  Illuminated  in  this chapter is the importance of SDL and how it compliments homeschooling. Moreover, the authors posit that the home, as an educational setting, should provide a secure and conducive atmosphere for learners to cultivate SDL skills.  These  skills  are  crucial  in  enabling  learners  to  assume  additional responsibilities, such  as engaging  in  sports activities or effectively reprioritising  curriculum  objectives.  The  underlying  notion  is  that  the responsibility  for  organising  and  implementing  the  educational  process should  rest  with  homeschooled  learners  themselves  rather  than  their parents.

Homeschooled  learners  should  be  active  learners,  not  just  passive recipients of knowledge from their 'teacher'. Active learning is imperative, as  homeschooling  promotes  SDL  and  equips  learners  with  21st-century SDL  skills (cf. Ricci 2009). However, parents must teach learners independence and self-direction (Wai-Cook 2020). Thus, a parent's duty as a homeschool facilitator goes beyond curriculum delivery. As homeschool facilitators,  parents  should  help  their  children  master  skills  and  become self-directed, responsible learners (Mifsud &amp; Day 2022; Wai-Cook 2020).

From the above, we see many parallels between the goals of SDL and homeschooling,  even  though  homeschooling  has  been  around  longer. Learning and instruction should centre on why SDL homeschooling matters in  the  context  of  contemporary  educational  models.  Learning  at  home requires the learner to be self-directed and self-motivated, with the student taking  the  initiative  to  set  objectives  and  complete  assignments.  The chapter's main aim is to emphasise the significance of SDL in the context of homeschooling, explicitly concerning how parents understand SDL in their  role  as  homeschool  facilitators.  The  chapter  also  highlights  how

parents,  as  facilitators,  can  effectively  implement  SDL  to  enhance  their children's learning experiences and overall development.

## The nature of self-directed learning

Self-directed learning represents a dynamic and empowering educational approach  wherein  individuals  take  control  of  their  learning  journeys  by setting  goals,  identifying  resources  and  autonomously  navigating  their educational paths, thereby transcending traditional pedagogical methods (Du Toit-Brits &amp; Van Zyl 2017a). This paradigm shift in learning promotes greater ownership and accountability and fosters lifelong learning skills, adaptability  and  a  more  profound  sense  of  personal  fulfilment.  To  fully understand the origins and progress of SDL, we must first understand the core of this revolutionary approach to education.

The origins of SDL may be traced back to philosophical ideals by John Locke  and  Jean-Jacques  Rousseau,  who  highlighted  the  prominence  of personal independence in the learning process (Collier 2022). Nonetheless, SDL began to gain prominence in the 20th century (Collier 2022). At this stage, Malcolm Knowles pioneered the central role of SDL by articulating its  principles  and  theories,  specifically  in  adult  education  (Collier  2022). That said, as time passed, SDL has been adopted in various educational settings  such  as  formal  classrooms,  online  courses,  workplace  training programmes and homeschooling environments. Therefore, understanding the historical context of SDL is vital to realising how it has evolved into a widely accepted and effective educational approach today.

## Overview of the history of self-directed learning

Elements of SDL have been evident in the works of prominent historians and scholars such as Socrates, Aristotle, Plato, Alexander the Great, Julius Caesar, Desiderius Erasmus and René Descartes (Bourke &amp; Loveridge 2018; Du Toit-Brits  2015).  The  lack  of  formal  education  institutions  in  colonial America necessitated SDL. However, only about 150 years ago, the United States  began  recognising  SDL  and  its  significance.  Over  the  past  three decades,  SDL's  significance  and  scholarly  exploitation  have  increased tremendously, classifying learners into groups representing goal-oriented, activity-oriented and learning-oriented individuals. Self-directed learning is premised on the idea that learners can initiate and direct their learning, leveraging  their  experiences  as  valuable  resources  (Curran  et  al.  2019). Adult learners, in particular, tend to be task-problem-oriented, driven by internal  motivations  such  as  curiosity  and  self-esteem,  among  others (Curran et al. 2019).

Historically,  SDL  has  evolved  to  emphasise  four  key  factors:  learning readiness, a conducive learning environment, appropriate learning strategies  and  outcomes  assessment  (Nasri,  Halim  &amp;  Abd  Talib  2020). Cultivating intrinsic motivation is crucial for effective SDL (Du Toit-Brits &amp; Van Zyl 2017a). In recent years, SDL has gained prominence in education (cf. Loeng 2020). The theory suggests that with support and incentives, individuals can enhance their self-directedness and autonomy (cf. Brandt 2020a; Loeng 2020). Implementing SDL aims to enhance the overall quality of  life  (cf.  Grover  2015;  Safapour,  Kermanshachi  &amp;  Teneja  2019;  Stebbins 2017) and livelihood development (Din, Haron &amp; Rashid 2016). Self-directed learning  benefits  learners  by  enhancing  interpersonal  skills  and  critical thinking abilities, helping them overcome obstacles (Taylor 2001). Homeschooled learners need confidence in various tasks for success in the workforce. Effective learning requires tailored opportunities, feedback and clear  instructions  (Taylor  2001).  Fostering  SDL  in  learning  environments requires a clear understanding of its components. A delineation of SDL is essential for effective implementation within homeschool settings. Understanding SDL involves goal setting, motivation, evaluation, resource selection and role definition.

## Exploring the essence of self-directed learning

This chapter adopts Michael Knowles's 1975 theory of SDL, which is highly regarded  in  adult  education  (Marsick  &amp;  Watkins  2001).  This  framework emphasises the importance of motivation and self-regulation in all learning environments, particularly those involving adults (Brookfield 2015; Knowles, Holton &amp; Swanson 2014; Merriam &amp; Bierema 2014). Knowles's perspective recognises that adult learners 13  have unique attributes and needs distinct from adolescents 14  (Knowles et al. 2014). Unlike younger learners, adults are  primarily  motivated  by  practical  factors  like  career  advancement  or personal  development  (Knowles  et  al.  2014).  Also,  this  study  embraces Knowles's SDL theory to explore the significance of motivation and selfregulation  in  adult  learning,  recognising  the  distinct  nature  of  their educational motivations and goals (Knowles et al. 2014).

Adult  learners  bring  valuable  experience  and  knowledge  to  their education,  offering  an  opportunity  to  enhance  their  learning  outcomes (Hiemstra &amp; Sisco 2016). Knowles's framework underscores the importance

of  SDL,  empowering  learners  to  customise  their  education  to  suit  their unique needs (Knowles et al. 2014). While initially aimed at adult learners, SDL  principles  are  relevant  in  today's  rapidly  changing  educational landscape. In the 21st century, learners must be self-directed, independent and adaptable. Assuming responsibility for learning, identifying needs and utilising  resources  are  vital  for  personal  and  professional  growth.  Selfdirected  learning  enables  active  engagement  and  purposeful  pursuit  of educational  goals,  shifting  learners  from  passive  recipients  to  active participants  in  their  learning  journey.  Learning  to  think  critically,  solve problems and make sound decisions are all abilities that may help selfdirected  learners  succeed  in  today's  complex  environment  (cf.  Tekkol  &amp; Demirel  2018).  Self-directed  learning  also  promotes  lifelong  learning,  as individuals  acquire  the  skills  and  mindset  to  continue  learning  beyond formal educational settings (cf. Du Toit-Brits 2019). The implication here can be that SDL fosters a mindset and skillset that support lifelong learning, adaptability,  empowerment  and  diverse  learning  experiences,  ultimately equipping individuals to thrive in an ever-changing world.

Based on the above-mentioned details and the arguments presented in the preceding paragraphs, it can be inferred that SDL can enable people to effectively adjust and flourish in diverse environments within a dynamic society  characterised  by  the  continuous  evolution  of  knowledge  and information (cf. Guglielmino 2013; Nasri et al. 2020; Tekkol &amp; Demirel 2018). Furthermore, SDL fosters a mindset of curiosity, exploration and continuous growth. In the current education landscape characterised by rapid change, SDL is essential for learners because educators need to prepare learners for  their  future  -  a  future  that  cannot  be  predicted  (Guglielmino  2013). Research highlights that SDL is a prevalent notion in contemporary learning frameworks  and  is,  in  general,  acknowledged  as  vital  for  successful educational experiences in a fast-changing world (cf. Du Toit-Brits 2015; Guglielmino 2013; Mishra, Fahnoe &amp; Henriksen 2013). This statement is also supported by Cazan and Schiopica (2014) and Mulube and Jooste (2014), who view SDL as the primary goal of education, including the idea that participation in learning is encouraged through the implementation of SDL. In addition to being exposed to SDL in the classroom through SDL activities, learners need to witness how others (parents and instructors) use these skills.  Therefore,  dedicating  a  section  to  illuminate  these  SDL  skills  is imperative.

## Self-directed learning skills

Self-directed learning skills are crucial for active engagement, autonomy and  lifelong  learning  in  modern  education  (Curran  et  al.  2019).  As  the conventional educational paradigm moves towards a more learner-centred

approach, SDL skills emerge as a critical asset for success in both academic and professional activities. This introductory investigation delves into the varied areas of SDL skills (Du Toit-Brits &amp; Blignaut 2019).

By  mounting  SDL  skills,  learners  can  be  supported  to  attain  their learning  aims  and  engage  in  learning  opportunities,  even  outside  the classroom  (Tredoux  2012).  Doing  so  can  lead  to  individuals'  career achievement and economic growth (Mulube &amp; Jooste 2014). The purpose of  education  is  not  to  coach  learners  for  assessments  but  to  establish responsible and self-directed citizens who can benefit their community, economy  and  country.  The  following  SDL  skills  (see  Figure  9.1)  are necessary for a self-directed learner, as identified by Barrett (2014), Du Toit-Brits  and  Van  Zyl  (2017b),  Guglielmino  (1977),  Guglielmino  (2013) and Samson (2013):

As seen in Figure 9.1, SDL is a vital component of education, and teachers or  facilitators  play  a  crucial  role  in  assisting  learners  in  developing  SDL skills.  In  addition  to  the  cognitive  skills  required  for  SDL,  the  emotional aspects  of  learning  must  also  be  considered  (Schonert-Reichl  2017). Motivation  is  essential,  as  SDL  can  be  emotionally  draining  for  learners transitioning  from  traditional  teacher-centred  models  (Schonert-Reichl 2017). Without proper motivation and guidance, learners may struggle to take responsibility for their learning (Ausburn 2002; Li Ping 2010; SchonertReichl  2017).  Exposure  to  various  SDL  skills  is  essential  for  learners  to

effectively engage in SDL (Hawkins 2018). Adjustment is a key requirement for success in an SDL environment, as learners may face challenges such as loss of motivation, interest, direction and understanding (Armstrong 2010). Maintaining attention and focus on challenging tasks is another SDL skill (Loeng  2020),  but  learners  often  feel  frustrated  and  confused  when introduced to SDL skills (Hawkins 2018). Therefore, facilitators must prepare learners for SDL by explaining expectations and requirements (Armstrong 2010). They should also convey the value of SDL and help learners progress through  different  stages  of  self-direction  (Hawkins  2018;  Li  Ping  2010). Innovative teaching methods like role-playing, storytelling and gamification can aid this process.

Self-directed learning skills are crucial in the rapidly changing educational landscape, fostering intellectual independence, meta-cognition and flexibility. When learners and teachers recognise these benefits, they are more likely to internalise SDL strategies and apply them in various aspects of life. Furthermore, SDL promotes peer cooperation, enabling learners to participate in group discussions, peer-assisted learning and collaborative projects (Blignaut &amp; Du Toit-Brits 2022). Facilitators who effectively convey the importance of SDL contribute to comprehensive educational experiences  that  produce  self-directed,  adaptive  learners  who  excel  in social interactions. In addition, not all learners possess SDL skills, which implies that learners need guidance to develop such skills (Egizii 2015; Lai, Gardner &amp; Law 2013). Researchers suggest that SDL skills can be developed with  proper  support  and  facilitation  (Lai  et  al.  2013;  Tredoux  2012). Facilitators  need  to  break  down  SDL  skills  and  guide  learners  in  their application. This support and guidance are crucial for learners to embrace SDL effectively (Lai, Shum &amp; Tian 2014).

## Importance of the development of self-directed learners

Self-directed learning is  a  fundamental aspect of education (Cazan &amp; Schiopica 2014), and it should inspire and enhance classroom learning and  participation  (Mulube  &amp;  Jooste  2014).  Developing  SDL  skills  in learners  is  seen  to  help  them  achieve  their  learning  objectives  and engage in lifelong learning opportunities (Du Toit-Brits &amp; Van Zyl 2017b; Tredoux 2012).  Furthermore,  it  is  argued  that  providing  learners  with SDL skills can lead to economic growth and career advancement (Mulube &amp; Jooste 2014). Self-directed learning skills encompass critical thinking, problem-solving, flexibility, communication and personal responsibility (Du Toit-Brits &amp; Van Zyl 2017b; Kan'an &amp; Osman 2015), highlighting the need to shift from a knowledge-centric to a skills-centric educational paradigm.

The SDL skills mentioned above relate to self-directed learners and the importance of creating opportunities to acquire these skills in the learning environment (Du Toit-Brits 2015; Du Toit-Brits &amp; Van Zyl 2017b). Learning how  to  use  SDL  gives  learners  more  options  for  approaching  and overcoming academic obstacles (Du Toit-Brits &amp; Van Zyl 2017a). However, it is acknowledged that SDL is not suitable for everyone; some learners require structure and guidance (Egizii 2015). Given the critical role of SDL skills in fostering lifelong learning and adaptability, it is vital to explore how  SDL  skills  can  be  effectively  nurtured  within  the  homeschooling environment.  Such  an  exploration  is  vital  as  it  can  shed  light  on  the personalised learning of a homeschooled child, the essential skills they develop, how they adapt to change and how lifelong learning is promoted, among others.

## Unlocking the power of self-directed learning in homeschool environments

The  home  environment  needs  to  be  a  safe  learning  environment  for learners to learn and grow into self-directed individuals. This safe learning environment needs to be the 'home' where learners with SDL skills are cultivated. Learners engaging in SDL achieve better results than passive learners  (Alamry  &amp;  Karaali  2016;  Hawkins  2018).  Self-directed  learning skills encourage learner voices in the 21st century. Listening to learners' voices and entrusting them with decisions about the nature of learning communities  are  essential  (Du  Toit-Brits  &amp;  Blignaut  2019;  Robinson  &amp; Adam  2020).  As  learners  tackle  and  overcome  challenges,  they  also prepare themselves to tackle and overcome problems that might arise in the  future  (Bull  2017).  The  proliferation  of  information  and  the  fast advancement of  technology  provide  significant  hurdles  for  learners  to stay abreast of current developments (Du Toit-Brits 2019).

Self-directed  learning  skills  are  crucial  for  engineers  because  of  the short half-life of their knowledge, ranging from two to eight years (Wulf &amp; Fisher 2002), and one may assume the same goes for other professions. Lifelong learning is necessary in all professions (including engineering) as discoveries are made daily (Guglielmino 2013). In today's technologically advanced  era,  all  professions  must  keep  up  with  current  trends  by implementing SDL skills (Nasri et al. 2020).

With the above information in mind, as authors, we believe that 'self' in the term 'self-directed learning' refers to an individual's mental skills and strengths,  and  it  can  further  be  assumed  that  'self'  may  refer  to  the individual's attributes that enable them to apply SDL skills. According to Song  and  Hill  (2007),  a  fundamental  incompatibility  exists  between

Guglielmino's (1977) concept of SDL and the perspective put forward by Brockett and Hiemstra (1991), highlighting the personal nature as a skill. Self-directed  learning  entails  several  learner-specific  skills,  where  the individual is primarily responsible for their learning (Loeng 2020). Egizii (2015, p. 1742) makes a critical point by arguing that not all people might find  SDL interesting; therefore, Egizii cautions educators to be sensitive when they promote SDL skills among learners. Numerous skills described in  the  literature  are  associated  with  self-directed  learners  (Barrett  2014; Guglielmino 2013; Samson 2013) and are listed below. Like all processes, learners must develop skills to be self-directed learners. Gündüz and Selvi (2016)  have  identified  the  following  skills,  which  develop  in  learners applying SDL skills, as being essential for the homeschooling system:

- · Learners recognise their learning requirements, processes and outcomes (Gündüz  &amp;  Selvi  2016).  Homeschool  learners  do  not  have  a  formally trained educator to help them with their work. As a result, learners must recognise their learning needs and how they will handle the work that must be carried out.
- · Learners  propose  their  own  learning  goals  (Gündüz  &amp;  Selvi  2016). In homeschooling, learners must plan their own learning goals and see how they achieve these academic goals.
- · Learners learn and apply effective time management, enabling them to properly complete tasks (Gündüz &amp; Selvi 2016). If these learners have busy schedules, they might need to plan how to prioritise their academic goals.
- · Learners develop the ability to organise effectively. For example, learners need  to  compile  schedules  to  track  the  progress  of  their  tasks  and monitor when tasks must be completed so as not to get overwhelmed (Findley &amp; Bulik 2011; Gündüz &amp; Selvi 2016).
- · Learners  acquire  specific human  resource  skills. For  example,  in homeschooling,  learners  need  to  know  how  to  research  a  topic  by applying  different  tools  such  as  web  searches,  books,  libraries  and YouTube videos and by conducting interviews with skilled people so that they can complete their tasks to the best of their abilities (Gündüz &amp; Selvi 2016; Jeong et al. 2018; Payne et al. 2013).
- · Learners  learn  to  apply  different  learning  strategies  (Gündüz  &amp;  Selvi 2016). For example, in homeschooling, learners do not have the guidance of  a  fully  accredited  educator  in  determining  learning  strategies  and they need to figure out which strategy would work best for them in a particular situation.
- · Learners develop the skill to self-assess to ensure adequate, progressive learning (Gündüz &amp; Selvi 2016; Hiemstra &amp; Sisco 2016).

As  seen  from  the  literature,  Du  Toit-Brits  (2015,  2019)  and  Guglielmino (2013) all argue that SDL is a vital skill for all learners in the 21st century (especially  in  homeschool  learning  environments)  for  them  to  become independent  individuals  who  can  maturely  adapt  to  an  ever-changing society.  Consequently, the implication for parents as homeschool facilitators, based on the information above, is to recognise the significance of SDL in the 21st century and take on a supportive role in fostering independence, adaptability and the development of critical skills in their children while also staying flexible and open to evolving educational methods and tools. Therefore, the following section delves deeper into homeschooling and the vital  role  of  parents in such an educational environment. As parents are the primary facilitators of SDL in this environment, examining their role in the  homeschooling  educational  experience  is  essential.  Their  guidance, support and participation are essential for creating an environment where children  can  become  competent  self-directed  learners,  enhancing  the entire homeschooling experience.

## The parent as facilitator in homeschooling

Learners who are being taught at home rely heavily on their parents to be actively  involved  in  their  education.  In  addition,  this  aspect,  support  to learners, is congruent with SDL in the sense that independence and active engagement in their educational journeys are prioritised. As an educational technique, SDL allows learners to assume responsibility for their learning, including goal setting and conducting independent research on numerous topics  of  interest.  That  said,  the  parent  as  facilitator  forms  part  of  the unique  connection  between  the  parent's  engagement  and  independent learning, which has special significance. In addition, teamwork between a parent  and  a  learner  (their  child)  serves  as  the  basis  for  independence epitomised by effectively incorporating SDL into homeschooling practices. As educators, a parent provides a conducive learning environment where they  guide  their  children  and  offer  them  a  variety  of  resources  in  their learning  journeys.  Parents  who  do  this  motivate  their  children  to  be autonomous  and  aid  in  their  development  of  skills  such  as  thinking analytically  and  managing  themselves.  Parents  may  assist  learners  in becoming self-directed by establishing a solid foundation for SDL.

Consequently, the connection between parental engagement in homeschooling  and  SDL  is  conceptual  and  tangible  in  a  real-world application.  Parents  often  modify  and  customise  the  curriculum  to  suit their child's unique learning requirements and areas of interest, delivering a personalised and captivating educational encounter. The technique aligns

with  the  praxis  component  of  SDL, 15   whereby  integrating  theory  and practice  facilitates  an  efficient  learning  experience.  Doing  so  requires parents to continuously evaluate or reflect on their teaching and learning practices to ascertain if they need to adapt their instructional approaches and materials as necessary. Such reflective practices may assist parents in fostering a flexible educational setting sensitive to the learners' changing requirements.

Given  all  that  has  been  mentioned  so  far,  parents'  involvement  in homeschooling can contribute to developing SDL skills in children (cf. Gray &amp; Riley 2013; Wai-Cook 2020). By actively participating in joint endeavours and engaging in scholarly activities, parents and learners can cultivate a passion  for  acquiring  information.  Parents  also  need  to  serve  as  SDL facilitators, showing academic behaviours and emphasising the importance of ongoing education. This contact helps homeschooled learners acquire subject-specific  knowledge  and  the  skills  needed  for  independent  and scholarly information retrieval.

Parental involvement is crucial for a child's education, offering various benefits for their development and academic success. Research shows that when parents actively participate in their children's learning, it enhances their  confidence,  attitude  and  academic  achievement  across  different subjects, as well as their behaviour and social adjustment (Mamacos 2020; Roy &amp; Giraldo-García 2018; Sepulveda-Esconar &amp; Morrison 2020).

The  focus  of  this  section  is  on  the  significant  role  of  parents  in  the provision of homeschooling educational experiences for their children. This role cannot be overstated, as the active engagement of a parent in their child's  learning  process  offers  them  numerous  opportunities  to  develop and grow into independent beings (Đurišić &amp; Bunijevac 2017). We argue that a parent can nurture the confidence and motivation of a child if they are actively participating in their learning; this fosters a positive outlook on learning and influences their success across all subjects they take.

Active  engagement as parental involvement greatly impacts a child concerning their adjustment to how they behave and act socially. That said, a parent so actively involved in their homeschooled child's learning increases discipline and overall positive behaviour (Đurišić &amp; Bunijevac 2017).  By  offering  guidance,  outlining  expectations  and  reaffirming fundamental  values,  parents  may  profoundly  affect  their  children's

psychological and social growth (Đurišić &amp; Bunijevac 2017). In essence, the parent through their involvement establishes a supportive environment that  promotes  the  ability  of  their  child  to  adjust  and  develop  socially. Hence,  this  chapter  emphasises  the  necessity  of  parents'  SDL  skills  in facilitating  their  children  in  their  homeschooling  journey  (cf.  Wai-Cook 2020).  In  today's  educational  landscape,  where  homeschooling  has become increasingly prevalent, parents' role as facilitators of learning is more critical than ever.

Therefore, parents' SDL skills can be crucial to their children's education (cf. Wai-Cook 2020). They can identify their children's learning needs, set appropriate  goals  and  design  engaging  learning  experiences.  They  can also evaluate their children's progress and make necessary adjustments. Beyond academic tasks, parents can create a nurturing learning environment, establish effective routines and promote a love for learning. This  active  involvement  strengthens  the  parent-child  bond  and  fosters shared responsibility for educational success.

However,  it  is  essential  to  remember  that  recognising  a  parent's involvement in their child's education is a dynamic process that evolves. As  children  grow  and  develop,  the  nature  of  parental  involvement  may change. Parents need to adapt their approaches to match their children's evolvement and promote their growing independence. Doing so necessitates parents to observe their child, be flexible and adapt learning according to what they observe, communicate effectively, provide positive reinforcement and set boundaries, which are all aspects that can be realised through a parent's  SDL  skills  (cf.  Gray  &amp;  Riley  2013;  Wai-Cook  2020).  Having established the critical role of parents in facilitating SDL within homeschooling necessitates exploring the specific opportunities that such parental involvement offers to enhance learners' educational experiences.

## Opportunities that parental involvement offers to learners' homeschool educational experience

Parental participation in their children's schools plays a crucial role in their academic and social-emotional development, a fact recognised both locally and internationally (Lara &amp; Saracostti 2019; Maluleke 2014). Bronfenbrenner's ecological theory supports this notion by highlighting the positive impact of reciprocal interactions between families and schools on a learner's socioemotional and cognitive development (Louw &amp; Louw 2014).

Parental involvement can significantly affect children's self-esteem and academic achievement, as evidenced by Garbacz et al. (2017). Numerous

academic  researchers  have  explored  the  correlation  between  learners' academic  achievement  and  parents'  involvement,  consistently  finding  a positive  correlation  (Pérez  Sánchez,  Betancort  Montesinos  &amp;  Carbrera Rodriguez 2013; Tárraga, García &amp; Reyes 2017). Parents actively engaging in their children's educational journey can profoundly impact their academic performance, improving grades and overall educational outcomes.

While  parental  involvement  has  several  advantages,  it  is  essential  to acknowledge  and  address  the  existing  challenges  that  can  undermine these benefits if not adequately considered. These challenges may include time  constraints  caused  by  work  or  other  responsibilities,  language  or cultural  barriers,  lack  of  awareness  about  the  importance  of  parental involvement and inadequate support systems to facilitate parental engagement. These challenges might pose challenges for learners in the homeschooling environment. In the following section, attention is given to some challenges that learners may encounter with SDL in their homeschooling educational experiences.

## Challenges learners face in homeschooling underpinned by self-directed learning

The authors believe SDL is pivotal in cultivating autonomy and promoting active  engagement  from  parents  and  learners.  Despite  the  apparent advantages of SDL, implementing SDL in homeschooling poses challenges like  curriculum  design  and  maintaining self-discipline  without  traditional classroom structures (cf. Gray &amp; Riley 2013; Pachai et al. 2016). In contrast to  conventional  educational  settings,  where  educators  are  responsible for designing and organising the curriculum, parents who  choose homeschooling assume this responsibility. Achieving this shift requires a nuanced  equilibrium  between  establishing  a  framework  and  permitting adaptability,  a  task  that  might  be  challenging.  Learners  may  encounter challenges  in discerning  appropriate  learning  resources,  establishing attainable objectives and sustaining a cohesive learning progression. The lack of a uniform curriculum may result in deficiencies in knowledge, skills and values, impeding a well-rounded educational encounter. As a result, implementing  SDL  in  homeschooling  can  be  challenging  for  learners. Without knowledgeable instructors and peer contact, learners may struggle to apply theoretical knowledge in practical ways, leading to a disconnect between academic and real-world domains.

One notable challenge that learners encounter within homeschooling is the academic dimension of SDL. The challenge implies that some learners may find it difficult to adapt to the level of independence and self-discipline required for successful homeschooling, particularly in the academic aspect

of their education. To interact with academic disciplines successfully and purposefully, it is essential to possess the means to access a diverse array of  information  and  perspectives.  Nevertheless,  those  educated  at  home may  have  limitations  regarding  their  ability  to  use  specialised  libraries and  labs  or  get  guidance  from  knowledgeable  mentors.  The  restricted availability  might  hinder  the  extent  and  scope  of  their  academic  involvement. Moreover, the lack of peer dialogues and debates may impede the process of acquiring critical thinking skills and the capacity to question one's ideas, both of which are essential aspects of the scholarly mindset.

One common challenge is the tendency for parents to push their children to develop SDL skills faster than they are ready to master them (cf. Gray &amp; Riley 2013; Martarelli et al. 2021). It is essential to recognise that SDL skills take  time  to  develop;  rushing  the  process  can  be  counterproductive (Guglielmino  2013).  Another  challenge  is  maintaining  self-discipline  in homeschooling (cf. Martarelli et al. 2021). Without self-discipline, hobbies, TV,  social  media,  games,  sports  and  family  responsibilities  can  easily distract  learners.  These  distractions  make  it  hard  for  learners  to  stay focused  and  engaged.  Without  social  interaction  and  support,  their productivity, consistency, self-discipline and motivation can be negatively impacted.

The  social  aspect  of  traditional  schooling,  such  as  peer  interactions and teacher encouragement (absent in the homeschooling environment), can  significantly  contribute  to  learners'  motivation  and  engagement (Guglielmino 2013). If  that  is  true  for  traditional  schooling,  learners  in  a homeschooling context may need alternative ways to stay motivated and seek  support  from  their  facilitators,  parents  or  online  communities.  The lack  of  constructive  acknowledgement  and  reward  can  also  undermine learners'  motivation  and  desire  to  take  responsibility  for  their  learning process  and  performance  (Guglielmino  2013).  In  traditional  schooling, learners  often  receive  feedback  and  recognition  for  their  efforts,  which helps  to  reinforce  their  motivation.  Finding  effective  ways  to  provide constructive feedback and meaningful rewards to keep learners motivated and engaged in a homeschooling environment becomes essential. Effective ways parents could include implementing strategies such as providing a personalised learning experience, clear communication, positive reinforcement,  various  rewards,  timely  and  continuous  feedback,  and celebrating milestones, among others.

In addition, maintaining focus and concentration can be a challenge for learners. In the absence of a structured classroom setting, mind-wandering and distractions can easily lead to losing focus on the main task (Pachai et  al.  2016).  Learners  need  to  develop  effective  strategies  (such  as  time management,  mindfulness  and  stress  management)  and  strategies  for

managing their resources (such as minimising distractions and organising study materials) to enhance their concentration skills and create a conducive learning  environment  that  minimises  distractions.  This  statement  implies that the mentioned strategies are crucial in the learning process for effective learning to take place - after all, effective learning is not only about the content  but  also  about  the  strategies  they  employ  to  learn.  More  consideration should be given to the setting in which learning takes place; learners need to be able to concentrate on the activity at hand if they are to learn anything. Additionally,  the  statement  highlights  the  importance  of  a  conducive learning environment free from distractions, indicating that the physical and mental space plays a role in learning outcomes. The statement also highlights personal responsibility in that learners have a certain degree of responsibility in  developing these strategies. For strategies such as time management, stress management and organising study materials to develop, parents, as homeschool facilitators,  can  consider  an  explicit  instruction  approach  to teach their children explicitly, such as setting goals, managing stress, staying motivated and building a growth mindset. For instance, they could introduce mindfulness exercises or goal-setting activities into the curriculum. Furthermore, they can book online time management workshops for the learners  they  teach  and  actively  engage  in  environmental  adaptations. The implication is that homeschool parents can help to create a conducive learning environment by organising classroom spaces to minimise distractions,  incorporating  noise-cancelling  technologies  or  suggesting specific study locations within the homeschool environment.

Homeschoolers face many challenges, including curriculum execution, practical application, scholarly pursuits, isolation and motivation. Parents and educators must work together to solve these problems. Self-directed learning implementation in homeschooling may be improved by providing resources, assistance and social interaction to help students and parents overcome these problems and thrive in school. Self-directed learning skills may  help  homeschoolers  overcome  these  issues  and  enhance  their experiences.  Praxis  in  SDL  applies  learned  information  and  abilities, emphasising theory and practice, where learners can study and use realworld environments to expand their competence and knowledge.

## The significance of self-directed learning in homeschooling: Fostering lifelong learning habits and empowering learners

Self-directed  learning  is  critical  to  homeschooling  success  because  it allows  learners  to  control  their  learning  and  shape  their  curriculum. In addition, learners are empowered through SDL to engage in curriculum

design  and  implementation  in  homeschooling  settings,  where  their parents guide the learning process. Active involvement of learners in this manner  promotes  independence  and  ownership  because  learners  can study subjects that interest them, select the resources they want to use to do so and set goals that fit in with their learning styles. Overall, SDL plays a significant role in creating a personalised and relevant learning experience for homeschoolers.

Self-directed learning in terms of homeschooling is crucial for translating theoretical concepts into real-world scenarios while developing the skills to think critically during problem-solving activities. Self-directed learning promotes hands-on experiences, experiments and projects, resulting in a more in-depth grasp of subjects. Furthermore, SDL encourages the exploration of multiple materials and views, enabling learners to dig deeply into topics of interest and research and critically interact with academic information. Selfdirected learning nurtures intellectual curiosity and the capacity for autonomous  thinking  in  learners.  Therefore,  homeschooled  learners  may investigate,  analyse  and  deeply  interact  with  academic  information  while gaining a broad grasp of themes through research and intellectual conversations. It can be deduced that SDL encourages intellectual curiosity (cf. Dweck  2006),  challenging  preconceptions  and  independent  thinking (cf. Reinders 2010). Therefore, SDL in the context of homeschooling plays a significant role in cultivating enduring learning behaviours, such as effective time management, intrinsic motivation and the capacity to adapt to various circumstances.  These  talents  provide  inherent  value  that  extends  beyond formal schooling, enhancing people's ability to adapt and thrive in an everevolving global landscape.

From the discussion above, the authors believe that SDL supports the development of enduring learning habits, which may include a strong sense of responsibility for their education, effective time management, staying motivated and prioritisation. These skills extend beyond formal education, enabling  individuals  to  adapt  to  new  challenges,  continuously  acquire knowledge and remain engaged with personal growth throughout their lives. The habits cultivated through SDL contribute to learners' resilience and adaptability in a rapidly changing world.

The  Global  Student  Network  (GSN)  believes  that  SDL  works  for homeschool parents because the method can be shaped into a teaching and  learning  method  that  reflects  their  belief  systems  and  the  unique learning  style(s)  of  their  child(ren)  (GSN  2021).  Moreover,  by  providing homeschooled  learners  with  chances  to  engage  in  critical  thinking  and develop SDL skills, they are effectively motivated to assume responsibility for their education and demonstrate accountability (GSN). In addition, the GSN asserts that SDL directly engages homeschool learners in the learning

process,  allowing  them  to  develop  research,  scheduling,  creativity,  goal setting and communication skills, to mention but a few (GSN).

Finally,  SDL  also  aids  in  establishing  an  SDL  awareness,  which  may positively impact learners' ability to adjust to the rapidly changing context in which they are finishing their education in the 21st century. It also encourages learners  to  have  positive  attitudes  towards  learning,  curiosity  and  selfconfidence (Bryce 2019). It is also important to remember that learners who take charge of their own learning will have a firm grasp on the following skills: self-awareness, goal setting (both  overt and  covert), resource acquisition and evaluation (Ayyildiz &amp; Tarhan 2015). In addition, self-control, self-sufficiency  and  self-regulation  are  related  to  SDL  (Ayyildiz  &amp;  Tarhan 2015). Therefore, self-control, external and internal motivation, self-regulation and  success  during  learning  activities  and  experiences  are  necessary  for learners who continuously engage in SDL to develop their skills to function autonomously (Ayyildiz &amp; Tarhan 2015).

Parents whose children are transitioning to SDL sometimes express that it is a new way of life, not just a new educational approach (Szalay 2020). Learners must develop various homeschool skills, as seen in the preceding sections. Homeschooling allows learners to customise their education into personalised education and learn at their own pace (Szalay 2020). As a result, learners must have SDL skills to navigate through their homeschool learning  journey, which  emphasises  the  importance  of  parents  also possessing SDL skills, as they need to help the learners, through facilitation, foster SDL in their own lives (Wai-Cook 2020).

Considering the discussion on SDL's profound influence on homeschooling and lifelong learning habits, it becomes evident that this approach is a teaching method and a way of life for both learners and parents.  That  said,  with  a  clear  understanding  of  SDL's  importance  in homeschooling and contemporary education, let us explore how SDL can be effectively integrated into educational systems to prepare learners for an ever-changing world.

## Self-directed learning and its relevance to contemporary education and homeschooling

Now that we have highlighted SDL, followed by discussions on the role of parents and learning in homeschooling, it is safe to say that SDL is not a solitary  learning  experience  or  learning  in  isolation  (Bull  2017).  In  the  21st century,  SDL  is  receiving  much  attention  in  learning  frameworks  and  is regarded as a relevant concept for learning experiences in an ever-changing world (Du Toit-Brits 2015; Guglielmino 2013; Mishra et al. 2013). In addition,

among other goals, SDL is regarded as crucial in education and serves as a motivating component of learning (Cazan &amp; Schiopica 2014; Mulube &amp; Jooste 2014). Self-directed learning skill development can help learners achieve their goals and opportunities outside formal education (Tredoux 2012), contributing to personal career success and economic growth (Mulube &amp; Jooste 2014). As is seen from the research conducted for this chapter, SDL is necessary for a thriving homeschooling environment because it provides more opportunities for learners to accept ownership of their learning. Homeschooling empowers learners  to  take  charge  of  their  education  and  connects  them  with  other people, resources and communities worldwide (Bull 2017).

In homeschooling, SDL can be seen as a process of parents or facilitators guiding their learners to be more independent, which, in turn, can help the learners in the homeschooling environment to gain an appreciation for learning, as they have to take up accountability and the initiative for their learning and should also be able to research topics to get a better understanding of the work at hand (Schoonwinkel 2020). Some overlapping similarities between homeschooling and SDL involve learners' ability to set goals for themselves, select their materials and resources to achieve their personal goals, and create and implement plans to reach them (Pickert 2012). In addition, SDL develops learners' career readiness skills, as learners need to apply time management to their routines and take responsibility for their decisions (Pickert 2012). In other words, there is  a  focus  on  readiness  and  preparedness for the world of work or life after their formal school years. The Department of Basic Education (DBE) determines the content of the school curriculum (Curriculum Assessment Policy Statements [CAPS]). What the DBE determines includes (Ayyildiz &amp; Tarhan 2015):

- · how learners learn
- · how many learners  should  already  have  learned,  and  how  many  still need to learn
- · where their difficulties will be
- · how educators and learners need to concentrate on the lesson
- · when and from whom they, as learners, can seek assistance during a lesson, and what the lesson outcomes should be
- · how learners and educators need to grasp the aims and objectives of the learning processes.

Even though the school curriculum makes place for SDL, the outline of what the DBE determines can be seen as a limitation to implementing SDL in the school curriculum. In addition, learners must control their learning experiences in the homeschooling environment to quickly transfer what they have learned in today's technology-driven world with constant change (Ayyildiz &amp; Tarhan 2015).

## Recommendations for enhancing selfdirected learning skills in homeschooling

This  chapter  shows  that  SDL  is  imperative  to  a  successful  homeschool learning experience. Here are some recommendations on how parents can improve their SDL skills in homeschooling:

- · Parents may use a community of practice (CoP) to stay informed about current  educational  trends,  ensuring  that  their  children  get  a  highquality  education.  Membership  of  a  CoP  allows  parents  to  remain updated on the latest modern educational practices, ensuring that their children  enjoy  relevant  learning  experiences.  Books,  online  courses, webinars and seminars are all great options for parents who want to improve  their  teaching  skills,  knowledge  of  the  subject  matter  and philosophy of education.
- · Parents  who  join  a  CoP  may  learn  from  the  insights  of  other  CoP members and get support by being involved in such a group. Learning from  other  CoP  members  will  allow  them  to  grow  as  teachers  and provide more educational options for their children.
- · Accountability is another benefit of being part of a CoP. Parents can stay motivated and focused on their educational objectives by sharing their progress and goals with others. Parents reflecting on their learning and  engaging  in  self-care  activities  can  help  identify  strengths  and weaknesses,  refining  their  approach  to  homeschooling  and  personal growth.
- · Prioritise self-care activities to maintain physical, mental and emotional well-being during homeschooling. Being healthy is crucial for the quality of life and facilitating learners effectively. Unhealthy parents may hinder their ability to facilitate homeschooling, affecting their ability to support learners effectively.
- · Embracing lifelong learning allows parents to continue their education and explore new interests alongside their children, fostering a culture of curiosity and growth.
- · Providing clear and concise definitions of SDL is essential for parents and  facilitators  in  homeschooling.  Offering  SDL  skills  workshops  can provide  hands-on  training  and  guidance  on  mastering  SDL  skills, facilitating effective homeschooling.
- · Creating  courses  on  SDL  implementation  for  parents  to  attend  can introduce SDL to them and guide them in implementing SDL effectively. Encouragement of SDL-supporting technologies like the Internet and practical gadgets may also improve homeschooling facilitation.

Having  reached  the  end  of  the  chapter,  we  propose  that  parents  can enhance their SDL skills and create optimal learning environments for their

children by implementing the above recommendations. In addition, SDL serves  as  a  transformative  force,  allowing  learners  to  embrace  lifelong learning and take ownership of it.

## Conclusion

Self-directed learning is seen as more than just an educational approach; it is a transformative way of life. People are inspired to trace their paths and embrace autonomy in today's society owing to the rapid availability of new career  prospects.  Self-directed  learning  symbolises  a  cultural  change towards curiosity and a quest for knowledge.

The  research  has  continuously  stressed  SDL's  critical  role  in  building learners' responsibility and independence throughout the learning process (Mahlaba 2020). It is critical for homeschooling parents to ensure that their children  have  the  required  abilities  to  become  effective  self-directed learners, which is possible through creating a suitable learning environment. Creating study environments that foster the development of personal and cognitive  skills  is  fundamental  to  nurturing  self-directed  learners  (Bhat, Rajashekar &amp; Kamath 2015). Parents can create educational environments that enable their children to assume responsibility for their learning, make well-informed decisions and engage in self-reflection. In these situations, necessary  abilities  are  prioritised,  including  critical  thinking,  problemsolving, self-discipline and time management.

In addition to the points above, the authors underline the significance of parents' involvement in their child's education and recommend that parents improve SDL skills to lead and assist their children successfully. By modelling self-directed  behaviours  and  providing  guidance  and  resources,  parents can empower their children to assume responsibility for their learning and become  motivated  learners.  Self-directed  learning  surpasses  traditional education by promoting individual power and independence. Homeschooling facilitates the cultivation of self-directed learners through the promotion of autonomy, critical thinking skills development and the fostering of self-reflection. Parents with SDL skills may significantly impact equipping their children with the necessary tools for achieving success in an evolving context. In the next chapter, we look at how the principles of SDL apply to the chemistry classroom and pre-service teacher education, expanding  our  understanding  of  the  role  of  self-directed  learning  in education.

## Abstract

Poor Chemistry performance may be attributed to various poor teaching practices at the school level. Indigenous knowledge (IK) might provide an avenue to effectively engage pre-service teachers and school learners alike in  Chemistry  teaching  and  learning.  Therefore,  teacher  training  facilities like  higher  education  institutions  must  include  resources  and  exemplify effective methods for pre-service teachers to successfully incorporate IK into their Chemistry teaching. One proven effective tool is the Rationality Index of Plant Use (RIPU). The RIPU tool also uses a heuristic to discriminate between  tenets  of  science,  IK  and  pseudoscience  to  promote  deep Chemistry learning. Using RIPU in a problem-based learning setting seemed to sensitise pre-service teachers to self-directed learning by requiring them to diagnose their learning needs, formulate intermediate goals and use the appropriate resources to gather the required knowledge while promoting ownership of and engagement in learning.

## Introduction

The  preceding  chapter  (Chapter  9)  delved  into  the  exploration  of  selfdirected learning (SDL) within the framework of homeschooling during the COVID-19 pandemic. Conversely, this chapter (Chapter 10) explored SDL in Chemistry  education  by  integrating  targeted  resources,  such  as  the Rationality Index of Plant Use (RIPU) in a problem-based learning (PBL) setting. This approach aimed to create a more nuanced understanding of scientific principles among pre-service Chemistry teachers. Both of these chapters highlight the importance of SDL in different educational settings and provide valuable perspectives on its practical use.

Current  work  skills  prioritise  cultivating  individuals  characterised  as lifelong learners, proficient in critical and creative thinking, and adept at problem-solving (Saxe, Mahmoud &amp; Razavinia 2022). Consequently, higher education institutions (HEIs) are responsible for producing graduates who possess  these  21st-century  competencies  (Markandan,  Osman  &amp;  Halim 2022). In the South African context, a substantial proportion of pre-service

Chemistry teachers come from educational backgrounds characterised by suboptimal teaching practices, resulting in a pervasive underperformance in the field of science, as shown by various assessment frameworks such as the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) (TIMSS 2019).  According  to  the  TIMSS  report,  the  achievement  scores  in  eight countries, including South Africa, showed a concerning decline. In 2019, South Africa scored 374 points, significantly lower than Russia's 567 points, Japan's  593  points  and  South  Korea's  600  points.  The  deteriorating performance in achievement scores raises cause for concern. Indigenous knowledge (IK) may offer a promising avenue for effectively engaging preservice  teachers  and  school  learners  in  Chemistry  education  (Kibirige  &amp; Van Rooyen 2010). In addition, IK can serve as a vehicle to contextualise the fundamental characteristics (tenets) of science. Incorporating contextualised content into the curriculum equips pre-service teachers and learners to evolve  into scientifically literate citizens and  discerning consumers instead of mere memorisers of information.

Despite IK's educational advantages, Widdowson and Howard (2008) lamented the inadequate integration of IK into Chemistry education, often perceived  as  pseudoscience  within  the  South  African  HEI  environment. Therefore, teacher training facilities like HEIs must include resources and exemplify effective methods for pre-service teachers to incorporate IK into their Chemistry teaching. De Beer's (2020) RIPU is a notable tool that has demonstrated  effectiveness  as  it  serves  as  a  heuristic  to  differentiate between the tenets of science, IK and pseudoscience which in turn could promote deep Chemistry learning (De Beer &amp; Wyk 2022, p. 488). Regardless of RIPU's roots in ethnobotany, it can be used as an instructional tool in the Chemistry classroom while following the principles of PBL. To Loyens et al. (2015),  PBL  is  seen  as  a  teaching  and  learning  strategy  that  facilitates critical argument analysis, promotes a deep understanding of the content, and aims at activating prior knowledge.

The relationship between the tenets of IK and the tenets of science in a PBL setting provides a fascinating intersection, highlighting the diversity of human understanding of the natural world. While these knowledge systems (IK  &amp;  science)  have  developed  through  distinct  cultural  contexts  and methodologies,  they  also  share  commonalities  and  potential  for  mutual enrichment while engaging pre-service teachers in Chemistry teaching and learning.  Furthermore,  several  SDL  competencies,  such  as  improved problem-solving, time management and research skills, were enhanced by engaging  pre-service  teachers  in  PBL  to  investigate  IK  and  science concepts. Several scholars have established links between PBL and SDL (Ali  et  al.  2023;  Golightly  2019;  Senocak,  Taskesenligil  &amp;  Sozbilir  2007).

To add to the literature on the links between PBL and SDL, the research question for this chapter was: How does utilising the Rationality Index of Plant Use enhance pre-service teachers' self-directed learning of indigenous knowledge in the Chemistry classroom?

## Literature review

The constructs Chemistry teaching, IK, RIPU, as well as the science concepts of the nature of science (NOS), IK and pseudoscience (in this order) are critically reviewed in this section.

## Chemistry teaching

The Curriculum Assessment Policy Statement (CAPS) states that:

Physical Sciences investigate physical and chemical phenomena. This is carried out through scientific inquiry, application of scientific models, theories and laws to explain and predict events in the physical environment. (Department of Basic Education [DBE] 2011, p. 8)

A concise differentiation between the Chemistry and Physics component of Physical Sciences is provided, namely that Physics 'deals with matter and  energy  and  their  interactions',  whereas  Chemistry  'deals  with  the composition,  structure, and  properties of substances  and  with  the transformations that they undergo' (DBE 2011, p. 8). Chemistry consists of qualitative (related to conceptual understanding) and quantitative (related to calculations) aspects, which must be taught comprehensively through diverse  teaching  and  learning  strategies  (Chua  &amp;  Karpudewan  2019). Unfortunately,  attaining  such  ideals  remains  unrealised  in  secondary education in South Africa, as evidenced by the 2019 TIMSS report (TIMSS 2019). Apart from the decline in achievement scores, a more worrisome finding is that only 36% of learners boast the basic scientific knowledge and  skills  for  their  age  level  (TIMSS).  Consequently,  the  South  African national  performance  for  Grade  12  Chemistry,  as  assessed  in  the  2022 National Senior Certificate Paper 2, averaged a mere 49% (DBE 2023). This figure reflects a disconcerting overall pass rate in the final examination that evaluates the Chemistry component within the broader Physical Sciences subject.  The  examination  results  underscore  a  substantial  challenge  in secondary education. Delving deeper into the potential factors contributing to this trend reveals a multifaceted landscape, which has been extensively explored and elucidated in various academic studies. The insights derived from Aris, Salleh and Ismail's (2020) comprehensive study are of particular significance.

Aris et al. (2020) conducted a study that examined the many obstacles that  impact  academic  achievement  within  the  domain  of  Chemistry.

The researchers discovered various challenges that pupils encounter that impede their academic advancement. One highlighted main concern is the widespread adoption of teacher-centred instructional methods. Aris et al. argue that this conventional methodology tends to restrict student involvement  and  impede  the  development  of  critical  thinking  skills. Additionally, they observed a deficiency in crucial resources and instructional  materials,  which  may  hinder  the  educational  process.  Aris et al. further identified a lack of creative teaching and learning practices while  analysing  the  educational  scene.  The  need  to  implement  more dynamic  methodologies  that  cultivate  creativity  and  problem-solving abilities in learners was  underscored.  Furthermore,  the  researchers expressed  reservations  about  the  efficacy  and  precision  of  continuous assessment practices. The absence of real-world, authentic scenarios and challenges  in  the  classroom  was  another  important  finding  in  their research.  According  to  Aris  and  his  colleagues,  if  these  challenges  are omitted  from  the  curriculum,  there  might  be  a  disconnect  between learners' theoretical knowledge and their practical application, impairing their comprehension and memorisation of the material.

Additionally, Aris et al. (2020) provided insight into student motivation and interest, revealing that in some instances, these factors were discovered to  be  very  deficient.  According  to  their  explanation,  an  absence  of motivation  may  have  a  substantial  impact  on  the  learning  process  and may be a contributing factor to subpar academic achievement. Furthermore, they observed that some learners had insufficient readiness for  the  learning  process,  a  phenomenon  they  hypothesised  may  be ascribed  to  reasons  such  as  poor  previous  educational  experiences  or personal  situations.  In  brief,  the  research  conducted  by  Aris  and  his colleagues  revealed  an  intricate  network  of  elements  contributing  to subpar  academic  achievement  in  Chemistry.  The  results  of  their  study underscored the need for an instructional strategy, such as SDL (in this domain) that prioritises the needs of learners, provides enough resources and  fosters  innovation.  The  above-mentioned  challenges  typify  the learners who contributed to the overall pass percentage of 49% in Paper 2 of the Physical Science examination after their studies at the secondary school level. The same learners then proceeded on various career paths at HEIs. Students who become trainee teachers are referred to as 'pre-service teachers' in this chapter.

Thus, pre-service teachers enter HEIs from a background riddled with challenges, and the possibility exists that these pre-service teachers might model  the  same  poor  teaching  practices  in  their  classrooms.  The  preservice teachers referred to in this chapter are enrolled in Physical Sciences at HEIs in South Africa. One Chemistry module of the Physical Sciences for Education  qualification  was  selected  for  this  chapter.  This  Chemistry

module is aligned with school-based outcomes regarding understanding matter, material and chemical change (DBE 2011). In addition to the content knowledge, the pre-service teachers also study the didactical components of the selected module. The didactics section relates to how the content knowledge of the module should be taught. Thus, how science content is produced and validated should be understood by pre-service teachers so that they would be able to teach the content well. A thorough understanding of how science is produced and validated leads to tenets of the NOS, which are also juxtaposed and related to tenets of IK. The constructs NOS and IK are part of this module and are studied by pre-service teachers who take this module. The operationalisation of these two constructs is explicated in the sections below. According to Kibirige and Van Rooyen (2010), IK might be  a  powerful  instructional  tool  in  the  Chemistry  classroom.  They  also contend that IK might provide an avenue to explore prior knowledge of pre-service  teachers  and  school  learners  so  that  effective  instructional scaffolding can unfold. This assumption was also taken in the conceptualisation  of  this  chapter  to  establish  how  utilising  RIPU  may enhance pre-service teachers' SDL of IK.

## Indigenous knowledge

Indigenous  knowledge  -  often  referred  to  as  'traditional  wisdom'  represents  a  wealth  of  insights  deeply  intertwined  with  the  lives  and experiences of communities. As Kibirige and Van Rooyen (2010) define it, IK  emerges  from  the  practical  engagement  of  people  with  their  environments during  daily  existence.  Embedded  within  these  rituals  lies  a  crucial metaphysical dimension that carries elements of magic and mysticism, as De Beer and Van Wyk (2022) noted. This metaphysical component adds a layer of significance to IK, infusing it with a sense of wonder and reverence. What  sets  IK  apart  from  other  knowledge  systems  are  its  distinctive attributes, as outlined by Kibirige and Van Rooyen.

Firstly, IK is profoundly local and firmly rooted in its specific community and cultural traditions). This knowledge cannot be plucked from its origin without losing its essence and significance (Kibirige &amp; Van Rooyen 2010, p.  237)   The  same  authors  highlight  that  IK  is  often  implied  rather  than . explicitly stated. It resides in the unspoken - understood through actions, customs and subtle nuances - making it an integral but implicit part of everyday life. The transmission of IK is a dynamic process, passed down through  generations,  not  through  textbooks  or  lectures  but  through imitation, demonstration and storytelling. Indigenous knowledge is a living narrative, evolving  with  each  retelling. Unlike  theoretical knowledge systems, which may rely on abstract concepts, IK is grounded in experience and  is  shaped  and  refined  over  countless  generations  through  direct

engagement  with  the  world,  embodying  the  wisdom  of  lived  realities. Lastly, Kibirige and Van Rooyen (2010, p. 237) contend that IK is not static; it  is  in  a  perpetual  state  of  transformation.  As  communities change and adapt to new challenges and opportunities, so does their IK evolve - a reflection of the ongoing interplay between people and their environments. Thus, IK is a living, breathing testament to the deep connection between communities  and  their  surroundings.  Interestingly,  the  participants  who participated  in  this  study  came  from  different  communities  and  were expected to teach learners in different communities. Thus, the infusion of IK during the teaching and learning process is necessary, as promulgated by the current curriculum document.

Indigenous knowledge  was  introduced to the school curriculum documents  in  2001  and  2002  as  part  of  the  post-apartheid  curriculum reform (Naidoo 2010).  The  Physical  Sciences  CAPS  document  is  underpinned by  IK  serving  as  a  guiding  principle  in  the  current  curriculum:  'Valuing indigenous  knowledge  systems:  acknowledging  the  rich  history  and heritage of this country as important contributors to nurturing the values contained in the Constitution' (DBE 2011, p. 5).

More specifically, the inclusion of IK in the Senior and Further Education and Training  (FET)  Phase  CAPS  document  validates  IK  as  a  knowledge system in science teaching by stating:

Indigenous knowledge is knowledge that communities have held, used or are still  using;  this  knowledge  has  been  passed  on  through  generations  and  has been  a  source  of  many  innovations  and  developments  including  scientific developments. Some concepts found in Indigenous Knowledge Systems lend themselves to explanation using the scientific method while other concepts do not; this is still knowledge. (DBE 2011, p. 8)

Utilising  CAPS  as  a  guiding  policy  document  to  plan  all  teaching  and learning activities, teachers and pre-service teachers must infuse IK with the  proposed  teaching  and  learning  strategies,  teaching  methods  and examples. Regrettably, the links between IK and Chemistry content are not made clear in this document, and teachers and pre-service teachers without a nuanced understanding of IK may be unable to accommodate learners from diverse backgrounds and cultures (Naidoo 2010). In the worst-case scenario, uninformed teachers may even dismiss learner conceptions based on  IK  as  scientific  misconceptions.  Thus,  the  absence  or  inappropriate accommodation of IK in curricula could have significant consequences for some  learners  (Kibirige  &amp;  Van  Rooyen  2010).  For  example,  they  may experience conflict between their existing knowledge and the knowledge presented in Chemistry curricula (Kibirige &amp; Van Rooyen 2010). Sometimes, learners must cross over from IK to Chemistry knowledge or abandon IK (which is inextricably linked to their culture and beliefs) to accommodate

Chemistry knowledge (Kibirige &amp; Van Rooyen 2010). Such learners could face  an  epistemological  crisis  in  the  Chemistry  classroom.  Figure  10.1 overviews epistemological differences between IK and (Western) scientific knowledge.

In  addition  to  the  epistemological  crisis  learners  might  experience, Kibirige and Van Rooyen (2010) contended that further problems could include  learner  disengagement  and  teacher  challenges  in  conducting proper baseline and formative assessments. These challenges may lead to poor Chemistry performance. On the contrary, several scholars (De Beer &amp; Van Wyk 2022; Kibirige &amp; Van Rooyen 2010; Srikantaiah 2005) indicated that  the  effective  integration  of  IK  (also  referred  to  as  contextualised content) could pose the following benefits for instruction:

- · making Chemistry concepts less foreign and more familiar to holders of IK
- · promoting positive attitudes towards Chemistry in the classroom
- · improved instructional praxis, as the new knowledge can be assimilated better if the teacher is aware of prior learner beliefs
- · real-life relevance  of  Chemistry  concepts  would  promote  a  more profound understanding.

Many countries - including Australia, India and the United States - have realised the need to include IK to contextualise content in the teaching and learning of science concepts in their science curricula (Kanika et al. 2019;

Pangemanan 2020; Tytler &amp; Hobbs 2011). This approach - also referred to as  the  incorporationist  approach  by  Naidoo  (2010)  -  views  IK  as  an instructional  tool  that  provides  a  pathway  for  learners  from  diverse backgrounds  to  access  (Western)  science  and  more  effectively  engage with science concepts. Naidoo (2010, p. 219) concluded that contextualised content 'ensured that learners were not robbed of the necessary concepts and skills to survive in an increasingly global world'. Contextualised content allows  learners  to become  scientifically  literate citizens and  critical consumers instead  of  individuals  only  memorising  facts.  Despite  all  the instructional benefits listed, the status quo remains that IK is not effectively integrated with Chemistry education and is still perceived as a 'junk science' (Widdowson &amp; Howard 2008, p. 242). It is also the view of Jacobs (2015) that there is resistance among practising teachers towards the integration of IK into their teaching practices. This resistance stems from the perception that IK is not evaluated in the exit-level examinations and is rooted in the belief that their teacher training is primarily focused on (Western) scientific knowledge. Therefore, it is of the utmost importance that teacher training facilities, such as HEIs, incorporate tools and model good practices for preservice teachers to effectively accommodate IK in the Chemistry classroom. One tool that may prove to be effective is RIPU developed by De Beer (2020).

## Rationality Index of Plant Use

Studies of ethnobotany by De Beer (2020) resulted in the culmination of RIPU - a user-friendly tool to rationalise and validate the medicinal use of certain herbs and plants. The Rationality Index of Plant Use is a heuristic tool  comprising  questions  that  result  in  the  overall  statistic  measure validating or debunking plants' reasonable and logical use for medicinal purposes. To exemplify the value and use of RIPU, we provide the example of the African potato ( Hypoxis hemerocallidea ),  also called inkomfe (isiXulu) or lotsane (Sesotho), which is commonly used as a tonic in IK to treat a malnourished person (Van Wyk &amp; Gericke 2018).

After selecting the medicinal plant from any IK system, the user must engage with scientific literature and scholarly databases such as Google Scholar, SciFinder or Scopus. According to De Beer (2020), an initial search of the plant's botanical name, Hypoxis hemerocallidea , serves as a starting point for RIPU. The overall number of hits based on the initial search just using the botanical name can be recorded (2,140 results on Google Scholar), and subsequent searches can carried out by adding more specific keywords to  the  botanical  name  such  as  'medicinal  use'  (1,890  results  on  Google Scholar),  'in  vivo'  (907  results  on  Google  Scholar)  and  'in  vitro'  (1,260 results on Google Scholar). The search results can then be used to answer

five questions with subsections, as indicated in Table 10.1. Furthermore, the user would then briefly read through some scholarly articles to identify confirmed hypotheses in high-quality journals and discover how in vitro and in vivo experiments were conducted (De Beer 2020).

De Beer (2020) continued to develop an easily quantifiable scale, which can be totalled to 30 marks on the tool interface. The total is divided by 30, resulting in a RIPU scale value ranging from 0.0 to 1.0. Low values (e.g. 0.2) correlate with a lack of scientific evidence to support the medicinal use of

the plant, whereas high values (e.g. 0.9) would indicate sufficient scientific evidence to support the medicinal uses of the plant. De Beer and Van Wyk (2022) stated that an intermediate score of 0.4 to 0.6 would require more research on the medicinal plant's chemistry.

As  is  clear  from  Table  10.1,  the  total  RIPU  index  was  0.7,  which  is considered  an  intermediate  to  a  high  score.  This  score  indicated  the limited  efficacy  of Hypoxis  hemerocallidea and  more  research  may  be needed on the medicinal use thereof. A more comprehensive use of the tool  (as  was  required  of  the  pre-service  teachers  in  the  intervention) would  require  the  user  to  summarise  and  record  findings  and  proof from  the  scholarly  articles  in  the  discussion  section  of  the  table  (we omitted this in Table 10.1 for brevity). We concur with De Beer and Van Wyk (2022)  that  this  tool  is  not  limited  to  ethnobotany  but  can  be  a powerful  instructional  tool  in  the  educational  setting  to  engage  preservice  teachers  and  learners.  Also,  using  this  tool  would  impose  a substantial cognitive burden  on  learners and  pre-service teachers. Consequently, we affirm that active involvement with the RIPU tool in the classroom  environment  is sine  qua  non for  SDL.  Pre-service  teachers would  be  encouraged  to  assess  learning  requirements  and  develop

learning  objectives  before  utilising  the  RIPU  tool.  Utilising  suitable scholarly databases would facilitate the acquisition of knowledge by preservice  teachers  regarding  the  selected  medicinal  plant  by  improving understanding of in vitro and in vivo experimentation in scholarly texts, as well  as  the  chemistry  about  the  plant's  active  ingredient  and  drawing conclusions  based  on  evidence  (De  Beer  &amp;  Van  Wyk  2022).  Such  an approach not only reflects the authentic realm of scientific enquiry but also has the potential to foster an engaging SDL experience in Chemistry.

De Beer's (2020) RIPU tool was only recently introduced in education and teacher training; thus, empirical evidence related to its efficacy and the  challenges  related  to  its  implementation  are  sparse.  Early  research efforts reported by De Beer and Van Wyk (2022) show possible teachinglearning gains for pre-service teachers. Preliminary findings from focus group interviews conducted after a RIPU workshop with practising science teachers concurred with the task's complexity and its potential to promote SDL, as expressed earlier. Furthermore, the focus group data reiterated that  the  RIPU  tool  might  promote  active  learning  involvement  and enhanced creativity while promoting cultural diversity and respect for IK (in a cooperative learning environment). De Beer and Van Wyk advocate that  engaging  with  IK  through  the  RIPU  tool  provides  a  vehicle  for exploring important science concepts such as the tenets (characteristics) of  science,  the  tenets  of  IK  and  how  both  science  and  IK  differ  from pseudoscience.

## The science concepts: The nature of science, indigenous knowledge and pseudoscience

Vhurumuku (2010) contends that international trends in science education focus on the process of science approach, which recognises that science encompasses  more  than  just  facts,  laws  and  theories.  This  approach acknowledges the importance of human activities when engaging with the process of science and so positively contributes to the development of scientific literacy of learners (Cronje, De Beer &amp; Ankiewicz 2015). Scholars agree  that  by  frequently  engaging  with  the  process  of  science,  certain common characteristics of science emerge. These so-called characteristics are  called  the  NOS  (Cronje  et  al.  2015;  Vhurumuku  2010).  Interestingly, many of these characteristics of science overlap with the nature of IK but differ from the attributes of pseudoscience (De Beer &amp; Van Wyk 2022). In the  following  subsections,  the  NOS,  the  nature  of  IK  and  the  nature  of pseudoscience are discussed to better define and differentiate between them.

## The nature of science

The  NOS  is  a  dynamic  and  multifaceted  construct  influenced  by  the philosophy, history and sociology of science (Chanetsa &amp; Ramnarian 2023). Cronje et al. (2015) contend that no single definition exists to define the construct  NOS,  but  because  of  frequent  engagement  with  science  and scientific enquiries, certain characteristics of science emerge consistently. These characteristics of science constitute the NOS. According to Chanetsa and Ramnarain, there are two schools of thought regarding the NOS: the consensus  view  (CV)  and  the  reconceptualised  family resemblance approach (RFN). Below, we provide a brief overview of the evolution of the CV from the 1990s to the RFN in 2016.

According to the CV, the NOS was expressed only in epistemological and  sociological  dimensions.  This  view  explored  science  as  a  mode  of thought and a means of understanding the natural world. Additionally, it examined how the values and beliefs of the scientific community influenced the  advancement  of  scientific  knowledge  (Lederman  1992  as  cited  in Chanetsa &amp; Ramnarain 2023). This understanding led to the NOS being summarised  by  seven  characteristics  of  science  (tenets  of  science), represented in Figure 10.2.

According to Chanetsa and Ramnarain (2023), scholars have identified several limitations in conceptualising the NOS, specifically concerning its historical  and  philosophical dimensions, as expressed by the CV. To this effect,  scholars  such  as  Irzik  and  Nola  (2014)  proposed  a  conceptual framework to address these limitations (i.e. the FRA). The FRA offered a comprehensive perspective on NOS by incorporating diverse philosophical perspectives and organising scientific knowledge  into four distinct categories,  as  Irzik  and  Nola  suggested.  The  categories  included  the following: science as a systematic process of enquiry; the objectives and principles underlying scientific endeavours; the methodologies and rules employed in scientific investigations; and the body of knowledge generated through  scientific  enquiry.  These  categories  were  enhanced  to  accommodate the  specific  needs  of  various  branches  of  science,  allowing  for  greater subject specificity. Chanetsa and Ramnarain (2023) exemplified the more holistic nature of the FRA by explaining that all sciences 'will make use of science  process  skills  such  as  collecting  data  and  making  inferences', but  some  sciences  will  have  to  exclude  non-subject  specific  science processes - such as experimenting - which does not apply to Astrophysics. The CV did not provide for such differentiation and subject specificity. In subsequent  years,  the  FRA  continued  to  evolve  through  the  work  of scholars Dagher and Eduran in 2016. Chanetsa and Ramnarain explained that the work of Dagher and Eduran expanded the four categories of Izirk

and Nola to include social organisations and interactions, political power struggles and financial systems. The newly expanded FRA was coined by the RFN, providing a more  nuanced  and inclusive framework for understanding the NOS, as shown in Table 10.2.

As is clear from Table 10.2, the RFN acknowledges the multifaceted and ever-evolving  nature  of  scientific  knowledge  and  methodologies  and carries  significant  ramifications  for  science  education,  interdisciplinary cooperation and ethical deliberations among scientific community members (Chanetsa &amp; Ramnarain 2023).

We  acknowledge  and  appreciate  the  RFN  approach  for  its  holistic nature; however, for this chapter, the RFN framework would add too much complexity concerning the constructs already mentioned. Therefore, for this  chapter,  the  CV  of  the  NOS  was  utilised.

approach  and  social  and  cultural  embeddedness.  Cronje  et  al.  (2015) explain that the reductionist approach refers to complex problems broken down into  smaller  parts  for  analysis;  social  and  cultural  embeddedness refers to the universally applicable scientific laws and theories; and science can be generated at a specific place. This CV of NOS enabled us to compare the tenets of science with those of IK more effectively, as recommended by scholars (Cronje et al. 2015).

## The nature of indigenous knowledge

Earlier, IK as a knowledge system was discussed in detail. Like science, IK also  has  distinguishing  tenets  (characteristics).  However,  many  of  the tenets of IK overlap with the tenets of science. Figure 10.3 offers an overview of the shared and opposing tenets of the nature of indigenous knowledge (NOIK) and the NOS.

As Figure 10.3 shows, the tenets that comprise the NOIK include both empirical and metaphysical contexts, which implies that nature is real, can be  fully  or  partly  tested  and  'the  universe  is  orderly,  metaphysical  and partly predictable' (Cronje et al. 2015, p. 323). Contrary to the NOS, the NOIK relies on wisdom in action, implying that IK is generated by hands-on, trial-and-error engagement with daily life rather than laboratory testing by

engaging with the scientific method, as in the NOS (Cronje et al. 2015). Indigenous knowledge solves problems holistically, ignoring the boundaries of  the  metaphysical  world  (Cronje  et  al.  2015).  Per  implication,  IK  is  an amalgamation  of  knowledge  systems,  which  includes  science,  religion, psychology and other fields. Therefore, this holistic problem-solving nature of IK is difficult to reconcile with the parts-of-the-whole problem-solving method in  the  NOS.  The  NOS  tends  to  rely  on  a  reductionist  problemsolving approach where complex problems are broken down into smaller, manageable parts  for  analysis  (De  Beer  2023).  Similar  to  the  NOS,  the NOIK is tentative, which implies that IK withstood the test of time but is subject to change as traditions are changeable, transformative and ever evolving (De Beer 2023).

As  argued  by  Cronje  et  al.  (2015),  it  is  important  to  realise  how  the characteristics of the NOIK correspond to the characteristics of the NOS, not  to  determine  which  knowledge  system  is  superior,  but  rather  to effectively integrate IK in the Chemistry classroom. Table 10.3 represents all the  main  characteristics  of  the  NOIK  and  how  they  relate  to  the  characteristics of the NOS for ease of reference.

The shared tenets of science and IK pose a conundrum - the shared tenets  validate  the  inclusion  of  IK  in  curricula,  yet  the  fundamental differences  between  the  two  constructs  pose  challenges  for  inclusion. Hodson (2009) warns that care should be taken to 'include anything and everything in the curriculum under the banner of science'. Consequently, the RIPU scale does not accommodate the metaphysical (i.e. immeasurable)

## The nature of pseudoscience

As the prefix 'pseudo' suggests not genuine or fake, pseudoscience can be succinctly defined as an imitation of science; it mimics scientific activity without  conforming  to  the  rigour,  norms  and  standards  fundamental  to

science (De Beer &amp; Van Wyk 2022). At initial observation, it may seem that IK  and  pseudoscience  share  few  similarities,  given  their  distinct  origins regarding  worldviews  and  methodologies.  However,  several  intriguing parallels  emerge  when  examining  the  underlying  tenets  of  these  two frameworks. Both IK and pseudoscience frequently challenge the established norms of mainstream scientific paradigms. Indigenous knowledge is firmly grounded in traditional wisdom, local customs and oral traditions, challenging the dominant authority of Western scientific dogma (Cronje  et  al.  2015).  Similarly,  pseudoscience  often  presents  itself  as  a dissenting  voice,  questioning  the  consensus  of  established  scientific principles, as shown by Pavić's (2013) study. In addition, it is worth noting that both IK and pseudoscience share a common tendency to prioritise experiential and anecdotal evidence as legitimate sources of information (De Beer &amp; Van Wyk 2022). This inclination starkly contrasts the rigorous empirical tenets of science (De Beer 2023). The correlation between IK and pseudoscience frameworks underscores the significance of cultural context in influencing beliefs and the intricate interaction between tradition, belief systems  and  empirical  evidence  in  human  understanding  of  the  natural world.  Pavić  lists  the  following  as  the  most  prevalent  tenets  of  pseudoscience:

- · vague and unfalsifiable claims
- · selective  presentation  of  empirical  evidence  (confirming  evidence selected while contradicting or falsifying evidence is ignored)
- · selection of unreliable data by being over-reliant on anecdotal evidence.

De Beer and Van Wyk  (2022) underscore that less rigorous or pseudoscientific practices are often disguised as science using scientific terminology. They also contend that it is of the utmost importance for preservice science (including Chemistry) teachers and learners to be able to discriminate between science, IK and pseudoscience. The RIPU tool is best used as a heuristic to develop a more nuanced understanding between the tenets of science, IK and pseudoscience, respectively, and should ideally be presented to learners (also pre-service teachers) in a PBL activity (De Beer &amp; Van Wyk 2022).

## Problem-based learning

To Loyens et al. (2015), PBL is succinctly seen as a teaching and learning strategy that facilitates critical argument  analysis, promoting  deep understanding of the content and activating prior knowledge. This chapter adopted the definition of PBL suggested by Sameuls, Sebatana and Dudu (2023, p. 93), who defined PBL as 'inquiry-based teaching and learning pedagogy  that  develops  the  learners'  conceptual  understanding  of  the content and SDL through the exploration of an authentic content-based problem'. Thus, by engaging pre-service teachers' PBL through the RIPU

tool, SDL is sine qua non. During PBL implementation, pre-service teachers work  together  to  plan  and  discuss  the  solutions  through  a  seven-step method listed by Bilbao et al. (2018):

- · Step 1: Exploring the PBL problem and defining concepts in the problem
- · Step 2: Delineating and defining the problem by identifying facts
- · Step 3: Analysing the problem to generate hypotheses
- · Step 4: Looking for explanations and identifying gaps
- · Step 5: Engaging in SDL by formulating learning objectives or issues
- · Step 6: Searching and applying new information
- · Step 7:  Evaluation  and  preparing  a  report  that  addresses  the  stated problem.

In  this  chapter,  PBL  was  operationalised  as  an  enquiry  that  develops learners'  conceptual  understanding  of  the  content  and  SDL  through exploring an authentic content-based problem.

## Self-directed learning

Introducing  open-ended,  real-life  situations,  for  example,  makes  it  an important teaching and learning method in a Chemistry classroom because it permits  learners'  engagement  and  participation  rather  than  simply acquiring information through direct instruction. In a study performed by Golightly  (2019),  the  author  maintains  that  the  problems  during  PBL activities  can  develop  critical  thinking  skills  and  learning  autonomy  and several SDL skills, including selecting and applying resources required for learning and pre-service teachers taking ownership of the learning process (Sameuls  et  al.  2023).  As  argued  by  several  scholars  (Ali  et  al.  2023; Golightly  2019;  Senocak  et  al.  2007),  this  study  acknowledged  the enhancement  of  SDL  because  of  PBL  implementation  in  a  classroom setting.  As  seen  in  Chapters  1,  2  and  9,  SDL  is  a  process  of  showing independence, motivation and confidence such that an individual is aware of what is required to be successful in learning or working. This chapter also sees the relationship between SDL and PBL in the following aspects:

- · Autonomy and ownership : Both approaches emphasise learner autonomy. In SDL, pre-service teachers can set their learning goals and take  control  of  their  learning  journey;  similarly,  in  PBL,  pre-service teachers  take  ownership  of  solving  complex  problems  driving  their learning process (Loyens, Magda &amp; Rikers 2008).
- · Engagement and motivation :  Both  SDL  and  PBL  can  increase  engagement and motivation, according to Loyens et al. (2008). When pre-service teachers have agency in their learning (SDL) and work on real-world problems (PBL), they often find the learning experience more meaningful and relevant.

- · Problem-solving and critical thinking : Problem-solving skills are developed by using PBL in pre-service teacher education (Sameuls et al. 2023).  This  approach  allows  individuals  to  engage  with  and  solve complex problems. Similarly, SDL serves as a valuable complement by allowing pre-service teachers to delve deeply into solutions and select pathways congruent with their strengths and interests.
- · Collaboration  and  communication : PBL  involves  collaborative  group work,  enhancing  communication  and  teamwork  skills  (Sameuls  et  al. 2023). Similarly, SDL also involves peer interactions, allowing pre-service teachers to share insights and collaborate more informally.
- · Research skills : PBL requires pre-service teachers to research and gather information to address the problem (Loyens et al. 2008). This relates well to SDL which requires pre-service teachers to explore additional resources and delve deeper into related subjects.
- · Lifelong learning : Both approaches foster the development of skills that can  be  applied  in  contexts  beyond  the  traditional  classroom  setting. Self-directed learning fosters a sense of accountability for continuous learning,  whereas  PBL  equips  learners  with  problem-solving  abilities applicable to diverse real-life situations (Sameuls et al. 2023).

We conclude that these approaches (SDL and PBL) can be combined to create  a  comprehensive  learning  environment.  For  example,  in  a  PBL scenario, learners can engage in SDL to research background information before addressing the problem. Conversely, an SDL project can culminate in a PBL activity where learners collaboratively tackle a real-world issue related to their chosen topic. Ultimately, the relationship between SDL and PBL highlights the importance of active engagement, student autonomy, critical thinking and the application of knowledge to real-life situations. Integrating  these  approaches  can  result  in  a  well-rounded  educational experience  that  prepares  learners  for  the  complexities  of  the  modern world.

In this chapter, the PBL intervention using the RIPU tool was presented to pre-service teachers by linking the problem to IK as a vehicle to explore the  tenets  of  science  and  pseudoscience.  The  methodology  section discusses the activity (or intervention) in more detail. Our literature found that no similar studies were performed in Chemistry teaching, but several related  studies  investigated  the  interrelated  notions  of  PBL,  SDL  and science concepts (IK, NOS and pseudoscience) as described above.

## Review of related studies

A study titled 'Teachers' affective development during an IK professional teacher  intervention  with  in-service  Life  Sciences  and  Natural  Sciences teachers'  was  conducted  by  Jackson,  De  Beer  and  White  (2016)  in  the

North-West Province, South Africa. In their research, Jackson et al. (2016) used Engeström's third-generation cultural-historical activity theory (CHAT) as a theoretical framework to examine the factors that facilitate or impede affective development in the pedagogy of IK. The results of their study  revealed  a  notable  enhancement  of  the  participants'  favourable disposition  towards  IK  after  the  intervention.  The  findings  suggest  that following  intervention,  teachers  show  a  greater  level  of  motivation  and interest  in  instructing  IK.  Nevertheless,  the  data  also  revealed  that  the provision of ongoing professional development, specifically within communities of practice, is imperative to support teachers' development of pedagogical content knowledge.

Valdez  and  Bungihan  (2019)  conducted  a  study  in  the  Philippines  to examine the efficacy of the PBL approach in improving the problem-solving abilities of Grade 9 learners in Chemistry within a public high school setting. The data obtained from a sample of 96 learners were analysed using a descriptive-comparative  and  pretest-posttest  experimental  design.  This analysis yielded the following findings: there was an inadequate level of problem-solving skills observed both before and after the implementation of the non-PBL approach. However, there was a noticeable improvement in problem-solving  abilities  after  the  learners  were  exposed  to  the  PBL approach. The utilisation of PBL in the instruction of Chemistry concepts to Grade 9 learners demonstrated a higher level of effectiveness compared to the non-PBL approach.

Baynes (2016) conducted a study in the field  of  participatory  action research (PAR) to investigate the perspectives of teachers on the integration of IK into the Science Curriculum of Australia. In this chapter, Baynes (p. 80) considered the 'attitudes and beliefs of a group of secondary school science teachers  to  the  current  imperative  to  include  IK  and  perspectives  in classroom  practice'.  Similar  to  PBL  discussed  in  this  chapter,  the  PAR process  described  by  Baynes  facilitated  the  participants'  cultivation  of personal and intellectual involvement before their implementation of IK in education settings. According to the research conducted by Baynes, the acknowledgement  of  various  perspectives  and  aspirations  in  science education, such as IK, necessitated a commitment of teachers' time and a readiness to engage with epistemological challenges. The teachers in the study encountered significant obstacles in the past because of their limited cultural knowledge and apprehension about potentially offending cultural norms. Although the individuals expressed empathy towards the integration of IK and had reservations about promoting social justice through education, understanding their teaching environments and perspectives on science necessitated  grappling  with  epistemological  obstacles.  The  preceding studies' results informed the formulation of themes aimed at identifying conflicts within activity systems with CHAT.

## Theoretical framework

Cultural Historical Activity Theory was considered a valuable theoretical framework for comprehensively understanding the intricate dynamics of teaching and learning chemistry within a classroom, mainly when including IK. According to Gewurtz et al. (2016), the utilisation of a single theoretical framework in a PBL study may not adequately address the multifaceted nature of the subject matter. To pre-empt this challenge, the present study was informed by Vygotsky's (1978) zone of proximal development (ZPD) as an additional theoretical framework. The theoretical framework of CHAT can be traced back to the early contributions of Vygotsky (1978) and has been further developed by influential scholars such as Engeström (1987) and Leont'ev (1978). The ZPD is a prominent concept formulated by Lev Vygotsky  within  the  framework  of  social  constructivism  (Taber  2020). According  to  Morris  (2020),  the  concept  of  SDL  is  grounded  in  the theoretical  framework  of  constructivism.  The  concept  of  SDL  holds significant importance within the context of PBL, as highlighted by Silen and Uhlin (2008). According to Vygotsky (1978, p. 86), the ZPD can be defined  as  the  discrepancy  between  an  individual's  current  level  of development, as assessed through independent problem-solving, and their potential level of development, as determined by problem-solving with the guidance of an adult or in collaboration with peers who possess greater capabilities. The concept of the ZPD encompasses two key elements. The first  element pertains to a genetic explanation rooted in the origins and progression of learning. The second element focuses on the significance of social interaction  in  the  development  of  knowledge,  with  particular emphasis  on  the  influential  role  of  a  more  knowledgeable  individual (Wertsch 1979).

According  to  Podolefsky,  Moore  and  Perkins  (2013),  the  ZPD  places greater emphasis on an individual's competence when engaged in small group settings compared to working alone. This is supported by Yu and Hu (2016), who suggest that learners' cognitive abilities are expanded through participation  in  novel,  engaging  and  challenging  learning  activities.  In addition, Vygotsky (1978) posited that the ZPD involves the potential of a learner to eventually attain independent mastery of a given task. Vygotsky underscores the significance of engaging in interactions with individuals such  as  friends,  family  members,  teachers  and  peers  in  constructing knowledge and fostering cognitive development. According to Vygotsky's seminal work in 1978, individuals from whom we acquire knowledge are referred to as 'most knowledgeable others'. Furthermore, Vygotsky posited that learning through social interaction takes place within the ZPD of an individual.  McPherson-Bester  (2019)  postulated  that  a  ZPD  professional development programme facilitates the establishment of linkages between

theoretical concepts and practical applications for teachers. This chapter focuses on the examination of Vygotsky's concept of the ZPD in relation to Chemistry  pre-service  teachers.  These  individuals  participated  in  an intervention where they were provided guidance by more proficient peers (who were also researchers) to assist them in effectively utilising the RIPU tool  for  their  SDL.  The  aim  was  to  facilitate  the  connection  between chemistry principles and their IK. Figure 10.4 illustrates the utilisation of CHAT  as  the  theoretical  framework  that  formed  the  foundation  of  this study.

The utilisation of CHAT in research endeavours that aim to understand the intricacies of real-world scenarios involves the application of a specific language  and  a  collection  of  frameworks.  These  tools  facilitate  the interpretation  and  analysis  of  observations,  interviews  and  other  data collection methods,  including  open-ended  questionnaires  (Gedera  &amp; Williams 2013). The utilisation of the activity theory framework in research involves the examination of activity as the fundamental unit of analysis. Activity, in this context, is characterised by the dynamic interplay between the subject and object, encapsulating the question of 'who is engaged in what  action  and  for  what  purpose'  (Vygotsky  1978).  Cultural-historical activity  theory  is  a  comprehensive  theoretical  framework  that  has  been widely employed, particularly in heterogeneous societies like South Africa, to provide valuable perspectives on the systemic elements and conflicts that impact the achievement of particular educational goals. This framework has been recognised for its strength and versatility (De Beer 2019; Igira &amp;

FIGURE 10.4: Activity theory framework.

Gregory 2009). The CHAT framework examines the dynamics of teaching and learning in the classroom through a comprehensive lens, encompassing various aspects such as the social construction of knowledge by learners and the utilisation of tools to support learning, as discussed by De Beer (2019) and Mentz and De Beer (2021). The third-generation CHAT model, as utilised in this study, is illustrated in Figure 10.5.

As depicted in Figure 10.5, each abbreviation is linked to an important concept:

- · R = Rules are described in detail under the methodology section
- · C = Community refers to lecturer(s), peers (other Chemistry pre-service teachers) and learners' communities
- · D  =  Division  of  labour  refers  to  the  roles  of  pre-service  teachers  to provide  their  known  cultural  practices,  engage  in  scholarly  searches related to IK, complete the RIPU tool and the lecturer(s) as facilitators and assessors of learning

- · S = Subject refers to the pre-service teachers exposed to 'Tools' and 'Rules' at the focal point between the two
- · O = Objective of this study is for the learners to learn Chemistry concepts (the tenets of science, IK, pseudoscience) using IK as a vehicle in a PBL environment (using the RIPU tool), thus because of 'Tools' and 'Division of labour'.

The theoretical framework employed in this chapter is CHAT, which utilises an SDL environment. Within such an environment, learners can establish connections between IK and Chemistry concepts, thereby engaging in an activity system. According  to Collier (2022), SDL  is posited as a transformative educational approach accessible to learners of all backgrounds. One distinguishing characteristic of SDL in comparison to other  pedagogical  approaches  is  its  emphasis  on  placing  the  'self'  (the learner or pre-service teacher) at the forefront of the learning process. The learner  assumes  agency  in  their  own  learning  process.  Batiibwe  (2019) posits  that  CHAT  offers  insights  into  the  ways  in  which  technology  can facilitate  instructional  practices  that  promote  transformative  learning. Based on an analysis of the aforementioned sources, it can be deduced that  the  intersection  of  CHAT  and  SDL  is  evident  when  considering  the impact of social and cultural factors on the development of autonomous learning. In this instance, learner autonomy can be conceptualised as the capacity of a learner to exhibit self-motivation and assume responsibility for their own educational pursuits. In such an SDL environment as envisaged by Knowles (1975), pre-service teachers must scrutinise their own learning needs, set their learning goals, identify the resources required to complete the tasks at hand and evaluate the outcomes of the set task. A contradiction of control exists between the traditional way of direct teaching and an SDL environment.  In  the  former,  learners  are  provided  with  answers  to  their questions; in the latter, learners are equipped with skills that allow them to answer  questions  surrounding  the  activity  or  concepts.  This  theoretical framework  is  observed  clearly  in  this  chapter's  research  methodology, where learners are provided with tools and rules to work within their small communities in class on various roles (see Figure 10.2), thus showing how theory informs practice.

As is shown in this chapter, CHAT makes clear how cultural tools and societal norms shape this zone, elucidating the impact of social interactions and  cultural  contexts  on  the  developmental  trajectory  within  the  ZPD. Cultural-historical activity theory enhances ZPD by emphasising the social, historical  and  cultural  dimensions  that  intricately  shape  the  learning process. Furthermore, CHAT and SDL intersect through the lens of social and  cultural  influences  on  learning  autonomy.  Cultural-historical  activity theory  highlights  the  role  of  social  interactions  and  cultural  context in shaping  cognition  and  learning.  Self-directed  learning,  conversely,

emphasises the individual's ability to guide their learning. The connection lies in how cultural and societal factors mould an individual's capacity for self-direction, setting the parameters of what is considered 'self-directed' within a given cultural framework. Cultural-historical activity theory offers a critical perspective on how cultural norms, tools and social environments influence  the  extent  and  nature  of  SDL,  enriching  the  understanding  of autonomous  learning  processes  described  in  this  chapter's  research methods.

## Methodology

According to McMillan and Schumacher (2010), the concept of research methodology is characterised by its systematic and purposeful nature, as it is  carefully  designed  to  generate  data  pertaining  to  a  specific  research problem. The specific procedures or techniques used to identify, select, process and analyse information about how utilising RIPU enhances preservice teachers' SDL of IK in the Chemistry classroom are elucidated in this section. The methodology section of this study addresses two primary questions: What methods were employed to collect or generate the data? What methods were employed for the analysis? In answering these two main questions, this methodology section allows the reader to evaluate this  chapter's  overall  validity  and  reliability  critically.  This  methodology section describes the research design, site selection and sampling, the data generation  tools  and  analysis,  and  the  intervention  that  pertains  to  this chapter.

## Research design

To  comprehensively address the broad research question posed by this chapter, it was deemed advantageous to use a qualitative single-case study methodology grounded in exploratory principles and guided by a pragmatic perspective.  According  to  Yin  (2009),  there  are  several  advantages  of using this design; among them is that as researchers, we could observe one case directly and relate it to the theoretical part (as described above); we got the data directly  from  the  case  and  analysed  it.  Similarly,  we  could provide a rich and detailed description of the case as we explored this new or  complex  issue  by  testing  our  assumptions  when  conceptualising  the study,  as  reported  earlier.  As  researchers,  we  were  aware  of  some disadvantages of a single case study, such as that it may not be generalisable to other cases, may be influenced by researcher bias and may be difficult to  replicate.  However,  as  Gustafsson  (2017)  states,  using  a  case  study provides illustrative possibilities that enhance the validity and reliability of

the findings, and this outweighs the stated disadvantages. The aim was not to generalise to other cases and to reduce bias by applying trustworthiness strategies to address the posed research question in more detail.

## Site selection, sampling technique and sample

Convenience sampling was utilised in this study, as it was conducted in one  HEI  in  South  Africa  because  of  its  geographical  proximity  and accessibility to the researchers. It is important to note that this study is part of a bigger project. For the sake of convenience, this HEI is referred to as African University (AU). African University is diverse, with pre-service teachers  from  11  cultural  practices  and  has  three  campuses  offering Chemistry  education.  Each  campus  has  an  average  of  40  Chemistry Education  first-year  students  enrolled  in  the  Bachelor  of  Education programme. Only two of the three campuses consented to participate in the research. Only two out of the three campuses participated because the  colleague  teaching  the  Chemistry  module  on  one  of  the  campuses declined participation in the study. The colleague is also not part of the research group. For ethical reasons pertaining to consent, this excluded the  third  campus.  Approximately  80  student-teachers  consented  to participate in the bigger project. One campus, Campus East, utilised the RIPU  tool  to  look  at  over-the-counter  colloidal  silver  as  an  alternative medication. The other campus, referred to as Campus West, utilised the RIPU tool to look at the use of indigenous plants in their communities. Campus East is in a suburban area, while Campus West is in a rural village. For the results and findings reported in this chapter, Campus West was chosen because this chapter focuses more on IK. Furthermore, only one group of five participants from Campus West was purposively selected for further  in-depth  discussions  for  the  purpose  of  the  chapter.  Thus,  the sample of this study consisted of five participants. This group was chosen because it scored a RIPU index of 0.7.

## Data collection instruments

Data were collected using the following three instruments:

- · an open-ended questionnaire (pre- and post-intervention)
- · the  Views  of  the  Nature  of  Science  (VNOS)  questionnaire  (Abd-ElKhalick, Bell &amp; Lederman 1998) pre- and post-intervention
- · Views of the Nature of Indigenous Knowledge (VNOIK) questionnaire (Cronje et al. 2015) pre- and post-intervention.

The three mentioned data collection methods have been piloted several times and used in various studies (e.g. Cronje et al. 2015; De Beer &amp; Van Wyk 2011; Gravett et al. 2017; Sebotsa, De Beer &amp; Kriek 2019). These studies included  participants  from  the  same  context  and  environment,  and the  instruments  were  deemed  valid  in  this  study,  as  they  were  used previously in similar contexts with participants from the same background. In  addition,  the  analysis  artefacts  (the  pre-service  teachers'  completed tasks, namely, the RIPU tool) provided insight into the pre-service teachers' process and experience of the PBL task. The open-ended questionnaire had about 14 open-ended questions. Those questions included 'How can indigenous knowledge best be incorporated in the science classroom?' and 'What are the tenets (characteristics) of indigenous knowledge?' The VNOS questionnaire had seven open-ended questions related to the tenets of the science (see Figure 10.2). An example of those questions is:

Scientists perform experiments/investigations when trying to solve problems. Besides planning and designing these experiments/investigations, do scientists use  their  creativity  and  imagination  during  and  after  data  collection?  Please explain your answer and provide examples if appropriate. (Abd-El-Khalick et al. 1998, p. 434)

The VNOIK questionnaire consisted of 10 open-ended questions related to the tenets of IK. An example of those questions is:

Hoodia gordinii is a plant used by Khoi-San hunters to suppress their hunger and thirst when they went on hunting expeditions. How do you think the Khoi-San people know this plant has these properties? (Cronje et al. 2015, p. 326)

## Intervention

An  'effective learner instructional intervention should include early detection  of  problems  in  academic  performance,  strategies  to  help learners develop better approaches for academic success and facilitation of self-directed learning' (Othman et al  2016, p. 1). Instructional interventions . focus  on  giving  students  an  active  role  in  problem-solving  (Niu,  BeharHorenstein  &amp;  Garvan  2013).  In  this  chapter,  an  instructional  intervention using  the  RIPU  tool  was  conducted  in  four  workshops;  each  workshop lasted approximately 1.5 hours. During the instructional intervention, PBL was  implemented.  Pre-service  teacher  participants  were  grouped  into eight groups of five members each. This PBL scenario was related to one study unit of the Chemistry module titled Science as Human Endeavour . In this study unit, pre-service teachers are expected to analyse the nature of Chemistry by referring to the points of contact of Chemistry with the other natural sciences; list and discuss the tenets of NOS, IK and pseudoscience; define  concepts  such  as  quantitative,  qualitative,  hypothesis,  law  and theory; criticise their worldview based on ethical issue; discuss the reasons

why  natural  sciences  are  practised  and  the  moral  dilemmas  (e.g.  risk analysis) that go along with this; and use and apply the scientific method. Thus, the PBL activity depicted in Table 10.4 was used as an instructional method to achieve the above-listed outcomes.

During  the  first  workshop,  the  pre-service  teachers  were  presented with the problem, as depicted in Table 10.4. In addition, one of the authors provided the participants with a brief overview and instructions on using the  RIPU  tool  and  scholarly  (Google  Scholar,  Scopus  and  SciFinder) databases.  In  their  collaborative  PBL  groups,  the  participants  had  to select one medicinal plant from IK to study using the RIPU tool. In the remaining  three  workshops,  the  pre-service  teachers  worked  in  their collaborative PBL groups to complete the scholarly searches, read the introduction, do the data analysis and draw conclusions from the articles/ anecdotes they found, and summarise their findings before completing the RIPU tool. During the fourth and final workshop, the PBL groups gave feedback on the overall RIPU index for their chosen plant, commented on the  in  vitro  and  in  vivo  evidence  and  gave  general  feedback  on  their experience. It is important to note that the one PBL group of pre-service teachers selected to study the Moringa oleifera (horseradish or drumstick tree), which is widely used for treating malnutrition in sick people. While using  the  RIPU  tool  for Moringa oleifera as  a  group,  the  pre-service teachers  scored  21  out  of  30,  resulting  in  the  RIPU  index  of  0.7.  It  is noteworthy to highlight that the in vivo evidence for the use of Moringa oleifera was  the  highest.  This  chapter  focuses  on  disseminating  the findings of this group.

In South Africa, the Black African population is in the majority and constitutes 81% of the total population (Statistics South Africa 2021). Most Black Africans rely heavily on African traditional IK for their health conditions for various reasons; it might be because of the economy or cost of living (as most people are unemployed and do not have income), being too traditional (trusting African medicine over Western or scientific medicine), etc. This has both positive and negative impacts on the livelihood of Black Africans. The problem that might come with IK is misconceptions surrounding the uses of various plants. In Chemistry 1, you discussed some of the misconceptions about science. Some of the beliefs and uses of some plants may be the result of misconceptions. In your PBL groups, you are required to discuss, research and report whether you support or are against the following plants and their uses: Pumpkin seeds (dried) eaten by African men for increasing fertility; Tshuku-ya-poo ( Hypoxis hemerocallidea ) - treatment of diabetes, pain reliever for abdominal pains in older women, and burning body fat; Moringa oleifera (horseradish or drumstick tree) - treatment of malnutrition on a sickly person and used as organic manure for crops; Phate ya ngaka ( Helichrysum caespititium ) - treatment of skin conditions such as rash or eczema and candidiasis; Tlhonya ( Elephantorrhiza burkei Benth) Albinism treatment; Lemon fruits for alkalising the body - reduces acid caused by fizzy drinks in the body; Moselesele shrub ( Dichrostachys cinerealor or sickle bush) - cures cancer; and Mokgalo tree ( Ziziphus mucronata or Buffalo thorn) - cures boils.

Therefore, you are required to choose one plant and use a Rationality Index of Plant Use (RIPU) heuristic to support your argument in your PBL groups.

## Data analysis

The VNOIK and VNOS questionnaire data were analysed by means of the method explained by Abd-El-Khalick et al. (1998) and Cronje et al. (2015), respectively, and grading rubrics were used to characterise the pre-service teachers' views on the tenets of science and IK as naïve, partially informed, or informed views. Each pre-service teacher was allocated a weighting for their  responses  for  the  VNOIK  and  VNOS  items  in  the  questionnaire, respectively, as one of the following:

- · an uninformed or naïve view (UI/N), scored 0 points
- · a partially informed or transitional view (PI/T), scored 1 point
- · an informed view (I), scored 2 points.

Saldaña's  (2009)  coding  technique  distorts  emerging  findings  from  the artefacts  (student  tasks)  and  open-ended  questionnaires.  Finally,  thirdgeneration CHAT was utilised to interpret the data and determine what factors  promote or impede the conceptual development process of the NOS, IK and pseudoscience. Mentz and De Beer (2019) described CHAT as a  'flexible  meta-theoretical  framework  that  can  assist  the  researcher  in interpreting data from complex settings or activity systems and to distil the finer nuances from the data'. Cultural-historical activity theory analysis further  focused  on  how  the  learning  task  promoted  SDL  and  what  the student teachers' experiences were in this regard.

## Ethical considerations

Ethics  is  an  important  aspect  and  process  in  any  social  sciences  and humanities  research.  The  relevant  Research  Ethics  Committee  of  the  AU granted ethical clearance for this study in line with the ethical guidelines, thus allowing us to conduct the study. The participants were asked to complete an informed consent form. They were assured that they would remain anonymous throughout  the  study  and  that  the  findings  would  be  handled  with confidentiality. The participants were informed that their participation was voluntary and that early withdrawal from the study would not be penalised. All  written  responses,  such  as  questionnaires,  will  be  kept  safe,  ensuring confidentially, in a locked cupboard at the AU for a minimum of five years as per ethical requirements of the University and shall then be disposed of.

## Positionality

Positionality is the practice of a researcher delineating his or her position concerning the study, with the implication that this position may influence aspects of the study, such as the data collected or how it is interpreted. (Qin 2016, p. 1)

In  adherence  to  Holmes'  (2020)  principles  of  positionality,  this  chapter adhered to the commonly recognised practice of situating the researcher(s) within three key domains: the subject of enquiry; the participants involved in  the  research;  and  the  broader  context  and  procedural  aspects  of  the research. Regarding the subject under investigation, there is a dearth of studies that have utilised RIPU as a practical guide for the teaching and learning of tenets of science in the Chemistry classroom while following the principles of PBL, and this study intended to address the gap. Massoud (2022) views positionality as a statement in a research article that may enhance the validity of its empirical data and its theoretical contribution. Our social-historical-political location in this study was that we were the lecturers teaching pre-service teachers in the referred module, which could have influenced our orientations, potentially impacting researcher bias or subjectivity in the study's outcomes. To ameliorate this threat, independent individuals were requested to administer the data generation instruments to  avoid  power  relations  because  we  had  a  direct  relationship  with  the participants. After data generation, we met again to discuss a data analysis process. To eliminate bias during data analysis, each researcher analysed the data set from each pre-service teacher using the grading rubric scores for the VNOS and VNOIK instruments. We then met, compared their scoring and discussed until  a  consensus  was  reached  on  the  rubric  scores.  The same procedure was also followed in the interpretation of the results and the drawing of conclusions as to what the data might mean. In this way, bias  and  subjectivity,  which  could  have  negatively  impacted  the  study's outcome, were eliminated.

## Findings and discussion

This  section  presents  and  discusses  the  findings  from  the  research  and addresses the research question. The discussion on each data collection instrument is presented separately.

## Views on the nature of indigenous knowledge

The preand post-intervention VNOIK  questionnaire results are summarised  in  Table  10.5  using  the  coding  guidelines  developed  by Cronje et al. (2015).

The  results  summarised  in  Table  10.6  indicate  that  none  of  the  preservice teachers had an initial uninformed view of IK; all the pre-service teachers  had  a  partially  informed  view  overall.  After  the  PBL  RIPU  tool activity,  80%  of  the  pre-service  teachers  had  a  partially  informed  view, while 20% had an overall informed view of IK.

## Some attractive tenets of IK to report on include:

Only 40% of the participants had an uninformed view of IK before intervention, but after intervention, all the participants had partially informed or informed views  on  what  IK  is  (Q1).  Before  the  intervention,  none  of  the  participants realised that IK was empirically based (Q2); 20% realised the empirical tenet connected to IK after the intervention. Only 20% of participants did not recognise that IK practitioners make inferences (Q3). However, all pre-service teachers at least  partially/fully  recognised the holistic nature of IK (Q7). It is noteworthy to  comment  on  the  solid  metaphysical  connection  made  or  experienced  by the pre-service teachers, as all the pre-service teachers recognised the role of myths in IK. (Cronje et al. 2015, p. 326) (The questions [Q1, Q2, Q3 and Q7] are found in the VNOIK questionnaire.)

## Views of the nature of science

The  results  of  the  pre-  and  post-intervention  VNOS  questionnaire  are summarised in Table 10.7 using the coding proposed by Abd-El-Khalick et al. (1998) and the same coding rating grid proposed for VNOIK to ease the interpretation of results.

Table 10.8 shows that 40% of the pre-service teachers had an overall naïve view and 60% had a transitional view of the NOS pre-intervention, whereas all the pre-service teachers had a transitional view after intervention. Quite concerning  is  that  all  the  pre-service  teachers  had  the  naïve  view  that atomic structure was observed with microscopes; after intervention, 60% of  participants  had  a  transitional  view,  noting  that  scientists  'performed experiments to know about the nature of the atom' (Pre-service teacher 1, undisclosed as non-applicable information, 16 April 2022). It is noteworthy to report the common misconception related to scientific law and scientific theory where 40% of the pre-service teachers had naïve views and 60% transitional  views  before  intervention.  Conceptions  like  'evolution  is  just theory is a scientific belief without proof' (Pre-service teacher 2, undisclosed as  non-applicable  information,  16  April  2022)  indicate  the  erroneous concepts regarding nature and the relationship between a scientific theory and scientific law.

A comparison between VNOIK (Table 10.6) and VNOS (Table 10.8) seems to indicate a better general understanding of the nature and tenets of IK than the nature and tenets of science. This might be because of cultural factors  and  possible  tensions  that  could  arise  between  activity  systems after the analysis of the open-ended questionnaires and RIPU tool artefacts. The following exciting tensions between activity systems were reported: VNOS - VNOIK - Open-Ended Questionnaire - Artefacts. Third-generation CHAT  was  utilised  to  interpret  the  data  and  determine  promoting  or impeding factors. The following tensions between activity systems were identified during the analysis:

## Tension 1: Tools (views of the nature of indigenous knowledge &amp; views of the nature of science) - Community (cultural) - Rules (knowledge of chemistry concepts)

Most pre-service teachers viewed IK and science taught in a classroom as two discrete entities. As a result, in their responses on whether IK should be included in the school science curricula, most believed it was not a good idea. For pre-service teacher 2, this tension seems to be an impeding factor. The participant seemed torn between his/her embedded culture and the scientific facts taught to him/her. On the one hand, the participant strongly believed in the metaphysical and mystical tenets of IK as 'spiritual realm', 'witchcraft' and 'rituals' featured in many answers. On the other hand, the participant stated that IK could not be tested or experimented on, as it was solely 'obtained (knowledge) in the spiritual realm', but 'science is based on  tested  facts'  (Pre-service  teacher  2,  undisclosed  as  non-applicable information, 16 April 2022). The participant seemed to view IK and science as two inconsolable worlds; he/she had to choose between IK and Chemistry (science) as knowledge systems. The participant could not see the overlap in the tenets of IK and NOS and seemed trapped between an old world (IK) and a new world (science). The participant motivated the world is in the 21st  century,  therefore,  practices,  including  IK,  are  becoming  irrelevant. These situations remind the researchers of the epistemological crisis that could result from insufficient integration of IK in the classroom (De Beer &amp; Van Wyk 2022; Kibirige &amp; Van Rooyen 2010; Srikantaiah 2005). Figure 10.6 shows  pre-service  teacher  2's  response,  which  may  justify  why  this participant did not see IK as science.

The  response  in  Figure  10.6  shows  that  some  pre-service  teachers associated science with laboratories, thus ignoring the empirical tenet of IK. Interestingly, for some pre-service teachers, the same activity system had a positive effect. Responses before the instructional intervention show that  they  saw  IK  and  science  as  more  similar  than  different  entities,  as suggested  by  pre-service  teacher  4.  Figure  10.7  shows  pre-service  4's verbatim responses.

FIGURE 10.7: Pre-service teacher 4's verbatim responses (Pre-service teacher 4, undisclosed as nonapplicable information, 16 April 2022).

Figure 10.7 shows that pre-service teacher 4 saw IK and science as two related entities focused on observing the natural world. Thus, the shared tenets between IK and science (empirical, inferential, creative, social and cultural) were  more  apparent  to  this  pre-service teacher. Such  an understanding  of  these  related  concepts  (science  and  IK)  warrants  this pre-service teacher to include IK in the science curriculum, which could improve Chemistry teaching and learning praxis, as described by various scholars (De Beer &amp; Van Wyk 2022; Kibirige &amp; Van Rooyen 2010; Srikantaiah 2005):

- · making Chemistry concepts less alien and more familiar to holders of IK
- · promoting positive attitudes towards Chemistry in the classroom
- · better assimilation of knowledge as a prior knowledge system (IK) is recognised.

Pre-service teacher 4 believed that including IK in the science curriculum would  give  learners  more  knowledge  of  IK  and  science  outside  the classroom. This links to the notion of contextualised content of curricula

Systems

that  allows  learners  to  become  scientifically  literate  citizens  and  critical consumers instead of individuals only memorising facts (DBE 2011; Kanika et al. 2019; Pangemanan 2020; Tytler &amp; Hobbs 2011).

Another pre-service teacher's response correlated well with that of preservice teacher 4. This participant stated that he would include IK in the school classroom 'because it gives you a better understanding of science' (Pre-service teacher 3, undisclosed as non-applicable information, 16 April 2022)  However, the participant added that IK may also include metaphysical . aspects that cannot be tested, indicating that the pre-service teacher has a more nuanced understanding of the similarities and differences between the tenets of NOIK and NOS (see Figure 10.3).

## Tension 2: Tools (Rationality Index of Plant Use) Rules (knowledge of problem-based learning) Object (connect indigenous knowledge with chemistry concepts)

During the analysis of the PBL rules and using the RIPU tool, a promotive tension  was  noticed  regarding  the  object/outcome.  When  asked  about their  understanding of PBL and the use of RIPU, pre-service teacher 1's response was (Figure 10.8):

The  data  shown  in  Figure  10.8  reveals  that  the  pre-service  teacher comprehensively  understood  PBL  as  a  practical  pedagogical  approach. Pre-service teacher 1 used 'reduce' instead of 'solving' (Pre-service teacher 1,  undisclosed as non-applicable information, 16 April 2022). This participant might have used the word 'reduce' in recognising that PBL problems are open-ended;  therefore,  one  solution  to  the  problem  might  not  solve  it

entirely. Furthermore,  Figure  10.8  also  shows  pre-service  teacher  1's response  that  using  the  RIPU  tool  during  PBL  may  address  some misconceptions  about  science.  The  analysis  of  the  VNOS  questionnaire (pre-  and  post-intervention)  affirmed  that  most  pre-service  teachers themselves still hold misconceptions regarding the difference between a scientific theory and a scientific law. It can be inferred that the RIPU tool came in handy in identifying student misconceptions within the Chemistry classroom when PBL was used as a teaching strategy.

In addition, using the RIPU tool in PBL learning activities provided preservice  teacher  3  with  insight  into  the  real  world  of  scientists  (see  Figure  10.9), as affirmed by De Beer and Van Wyk (2022).

## Tension 3: Rules (principles of self-directed learning) - Tools (Rationality Index of Plant Use) - Object (self-directed learning environment)

The  analysis  of  the  RIPU  tool  and  the  object  of  connecting  Chemistry concepts  in  an  SDL  environment  highlighted  the  following  promotive interactions. Although the intervention was not poised to investigate SDL per se , several SDL competencies were implied in the pre-service teachers' responses. Q3's word choice, for example, 'I came to realise…' (Pre-service teacher 3, undisclosed as non-applicable information, 16 April 2022) relates to the pre-service teacher taking ownership of learning. Q1 indicated that the most valuable aspect of RIPU was the activity 'I was able to collect and gather knowledge' (Pre-service teacher 3, undisclosed as non-applicable information,  16  April  2022)   This  pre-service  teacher  could  diagnose  his . learning  needs,  formulate  intermediate  goals  and  use  the  appropriate resources to gather the required knowledge.

In  addition,  the  same  pre-service  teacher  indicated  that  the  RIPU activity could be improved by 'find[ing] ways to increase activity'. Thus, relating to the reflection on and evaluation of the outcomes. These implied

skills -related  to  the  most  basic  definition  of  SDL  (Knowles  1975)  sensitised the pre-service teachers to SDL, as De Beer and Van Wyk (2022) anticipated.

Pre-service teacher 3's response in Figure 10.10 corroborates that the preservice teachers were sensitised to SDL by referring to engagement and motivational affordances of both PBL and SDL, according to Loyens et al. (2008). In addition, the mention of research skills relates to the ability of pre-service  teachers  to  'identify  human  or  material  resources'  (Knowles 1975, p. 18).

## Recommendations from the study

The study found that pre-service teachers had difficulties with a nuanced understanding of both IK and the tenets of science, and they struggled to identify the common tenets of both constructs. In the problem-based and SDL  environment,  pre-service  teachers  (first-year  university  students) could benefit from more scaffolding of the learning tasks. As recommended by De Beer and Van Wyk (2022), possible scaffolds could include guidance in the use of scholarly and scientific databases; assisting the pre-service teachers to differentiate between the so-called grey and white literature; and providing clear examples to better distinguish between in vitro and in vivo experimentation. Furthermore, the PBL task could rather be integrated as project-based learning. Project-based learning, as defined by Sameuls et al. (2023), assumes better scaffolding than in PBL and affords more time for meaningful presentation of and reflection on findings. Such a process could therefore sensitise pre-service teachers better to the notion of SDL. A  further  recommendation  is  that  the  constructs  of  RIPU,  IK  and  NOS should be included in all science modules to prepare future science teachers holistically so that they would be able to teach science with a clear idea of how science is generated and the link of science with learners' everyday experiences.

## Recommendations for further research

Only one plant, the Moringa oleifera plant, was used in this study where pre-service  Chemistry  teachers  made  connections  to  science  concepts. The recommendation emanating from this study is that more plants could be investigated and used for future studies. This study also had a sample of only five pre-service Chemistry teachers and the recommendation is that a larger  sample  of  pre-service  teachers  can  be  used  in  future  studies specialising  in  Chemistry  and  Natural  Sciences,  as  IK  does  not  relate  to the subject Chemistry only. All teachers teaching most sciences face the dilemma of integrating IK into their classrooms. It is recommended that the interconnections of NOS and NOIK be explored in various contexts, different disciplines and school grade levels using the RIPU tool as illustrated in  this  chapter.  A  mixed-methods  approach  using  the  qualitative  tools described in this chapter and quantitative SDL tools are recommended for future  research  efforts.  A  mixed-methods  approach  may  ensure  a  more rigorous  understanding  of  how  the  SDL  competencies  of  pre-service teachers are influenced by using the RIPU tool in a PBL task to explore the tenets of science and IK. In such a study, it is recommended that the specific model  proposed  by  Mentz  and  De  Beer  (2021)  be  used  for  CHAT  as  a research lens to provide a more nuanced understanding of the intervention and the effect thereof on pre-service teachers.

## Conclusion

This study sought to answer the research question: How does utilising the RIPU enhance pre-service teachers' SDL of IK in the Chemistry classroom? This question was answered by showing how five Chemistry pre-service teachers  utilised  the  RIPU  rubric  in  a  PBL  classroom  concerning  IK  of using  the Moringa  oleifera plant  and  making  connections  to  science concepts. The analysis of the VNOIK and VNOS questionnaires showed a somewhat  more  nuanced  understanding  of  both  IK  and  the  tenets  of science. However, the pre-service teachers still struggled to identify the common tenets of these two constructs.

Third-generation CHAT, as used in this chapter, provided insight into possible impeding or promotive interactions during this PBL activity using the RIPU tool. Failure to acknowledge the IK of pre-service teachers may result  in  an  epistemological  crisis,  as  one  might  feel  bound  to  choose either  IK or science  as  a  knowledge  system.  Conversely,  adequate acknowledgement of IK makes Chemistry concepts less alien, promotes motivation and engagement of pre-service teachers and helps with better

assimilation of new knowledge to prior knowledge structures. In addition, PBL  learning  activities  using  the  RIPU  tool  seem  to  assist  pre-service teachers to identify scientific misconceptions, help understand the reallife relevance of Chemistry by reading about laboratory procedures and promote understanding of PBL as a teaching and learning strategy to use in their classrooms.

Finally,  the  RIPU  tool  used  in  a  PBL  learning  environment  seemed to sensitise the pre-service teachers to the notion of SDL by requiring them to diagnose  learning  needs,  formulate  intermediate  goals  and  use  the appropriate resources to gather the required knowledge while promoting ownership of and engaging in learning.

This scholarly book provides an in-depth analysis of self-directed learning (SDL) within contexts of curriculum, praxis, and scholarship. The book presents original research from multiple authors, which provides diverse perspectives and methodologies for enhancing understanding of SDL.

The book primarily focuses on incorporating SDL into curriculum development and emphasises the significance of scholarly research in designing effective curricula. It explores the integration of technology in learning and adapts instructional strategies to meet the evolving demands of higher education and school environments. Inspired by constructivism, socio-constructivism, and contextbased learning theories, the book presents practical strategies for educators.

Key topics include the implications of artificial intelligence, strategies for reducing procrastination, fostering SDL in homeschooling, enhancing SDL attributes, preparing teachers for self-direction, facilitating  curriculum  transformation,  and  incorporating  indigenous  knowledge.  The  book  also covers teaching climate change education and integrating educational robotics.

Self-Directed Learning: Curriculum implementation, praxis and scholarship in context is invaluable for scholars and researchers in education, providing empirical findings and practical insights  to  inspire  further  research.  It  aims  to  equip  learners  with  21st-century  skills,  preparing them for the challenges of the Fourth Industrial Revolution.

Self-directed learning takes centre stage in this insightful scholarly book, significantly adding to the available knowledge in the field of self-directed learning (SDL) by successfully linking theory and practice across ten chapters. It provides a variety of practical examples of SDL implementation in both  higher  and  primary/secondary  school  education,  making  it  invaluable  for  scholars  and practising academics, such as lecturers.

The chapters cover a wide range of areas that link to SDL, starting with the theories underpinning this approach to learning and teaching and ending in a Physics classroom at a higher education institution.

Some of the chapters are especially valuable to institutions that conduct teacher training and in-service  training  of  teachers,  where  SDL  could  improve  learners'  and  teachers'  agency.  The publication is a must-read for scholars and academics committed to achieving learning success through innovative and self-directed approaches.
