## Peer-review declaration

The  publisher  (AOSIS)  endorses  the  South  African  'National  Scholarly  Book Publishers Forum Best Practice for Peer-Review of Scholarly Books'. The scholarly book proposal form was evaluated by our Social Sciences, Humanities, Education and Business Management  editorial board. The manuscript underwent an evaluation to compare the level of originality with other published works and was subjected to rigorous two-step peer-review before publication by two technical expert reviewers who did not include the volume editors and were independent of the volume editors, with the identities of the reviewers not revealed to the editors or authors. The reviewers were independent of the publisher, editors and authors. The publisher shared feedback on the similarity report and the reviewers' inputs with  the  manuscript's  editors  to  improve  the  manuscript.  Where  the  reviewers recommended  revisions  and  improvements,  the  editors  responded  adequately to such recommendations. The reviewers commented positively on the scholarly merits of the manuscript and recommended that the book be published.

## Research justification

The focus of this book is original research regarding the implementation of problembased learning (PBL) and pedagogies of play (PoPs) as active approaches to foster self-directed learning (SDL).

With  the  Fourth  Industrial  Revolution  (4IR)  in  mind,  educational  institutions need to rethink teaching and learning for the future. As such, active engagement can be encouraged, as evident in this book, where PBL drives learning through realworld problems, while PoP focuses on innovative environments where the action of play and learning are integrated with the aim of developing SDL.

The  following  are  addressed  in  the  chapters:  an  overview  of  PBL  and  PoP, metaliteracy, playful PBL tasks, computational thinking in game-based tasks and geometry,  solving  puzzles, applying  LEGO®,  using  drama  as  the  PoP  and implementing educational robotics (ER). The empirical research findings disseminated in this book aim to inspire academics in the research focus area of SDL with active learning approaches in the school and tertiary classroom that hold affordances to enhance 21st-century skills. Active learning is an umbrella term for pedagogies  that  mainstream  student  engagement,  such  as  PBL,  cooperative learning, gamification, role-play and drama. This scholarly book highlights various engaging pedagogies.

Initially  submitted  abstracts  were  screened  by  a  scientific  committee.  All chapters were submitted, and put through Turnitin for plagiarism detection, and the editors screened them before being submitted to AOSIS Scholarly Books, which performed similarities, overlaps and plagiarism checks via iThenticate, following a rigorous peer-review process. The editors are confident that the book comprises a valuable scholarly discourse that will consequently contribute to the scholarship on PBL,  PoP  and  SDL.  In  addition,  we  confirm  that  no  part  of  the  book  has  been plagiarised.

Her  research  focuses  on  applying  DBPs  in  language  teaching  to

promote critical  learner  engagement  and  SDL.  Furthermore,  besides  its ability to provide learners and students with the necessary skills to navigate their respective academic phases, drama-based pedagogy (DBP) can also reveal the beauty of language, which most teacher-centred practices might not. While the perception might be that the pedagogy's 'fun factor' may cause learners and teachers to lose focus, it provides a different avenue for both  parties  to  explore  their  subject  content  and  uniquely  express themselves if researched and applied accurately.

## Foreword

Josef de Beer

Science Learning Centre for Africa, University of the Western Cape, South Africa

This scholarly book explores the nexus of engaging pedagogies and selfdirected learning (SDL). When I was asked to write the foreword for this much-needed book, I was reminded of the insights of two authors. The first was the wisdom of John Slaughter, quoted in Chmielewski and Stapleton (2009,  p.  53),  who  stated  that  'research  is  to  teaching  what  sin  is  to confession; if you don't participate in the former you have very little to say in the latter'.

The empirical research findings disseminated in this book will hopefully inspire practitioners to experiment with more active learning approaches in  the  school  and  tertiary  classroom  that  hold  affordances  to  enhance 21st-century skills. The second author that came to mind was Tytler (2007), who - fifteen years ago already - stated that there is a genuine mood for change to re-imagine education to suit today's world. The world is rapidly changing, and education should change with it. We live in a world where artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming more important. One example is the social humanoid robot Sophia, developed by Hong Kong-based company Hanson Robotics, which became the first robot to attain citizenship in a country (Saudi Arabia).

Research tells us that transmission-mode approaches still plague many South  African  classrooms.  This  often  leads  to  student  disengagement, highlighting the need for active learning approaches. Active learning is an umbrella term for pedagogies that mainstream student engagement, such as problem-based learning (PBL), cooperative learning, gamification, roleplay  and  drama.  The  chapters  in  this  book  highlight  various  engaging pedagogies  where  the  learners,  as Homo  ludens [the  playing  human] (Huizinga 1955), engage with the learning content. The role of play in the learning  process  was  very  central  in  the  work  of  Lev  Vygotsky  (1978). Veresov (2004) refers to the 'hidden dimension' of Vygotsky's work that escaped social-constructivist scholars for decades. Although most Vygotskyan  scholars  explain  scaffolding  of  learning  across  the  zone  of proximal development (ZPD) by referring to the 'inter-psychological' and 'intra-psychological' categories, a fundamental aspect of Vygotsky's work was missing in the discourse. Veresov traces the construct of 'categories' back to pre-revolutionary Russian theatre. Learners first construct

knowledge  together  (the  'inter-psychological  category'),  after  which internalisation occurs (the 'intra-psychological level'). However, as Veresov (2004, p. 14) shows, the word 'category' in the Russian-theatre context actually meant 'a dramatic event, a collision of the characters on stage'. Firstly,  the  roots  of  Vygotsky's  work  can  be  found  in  play  and  drama. Secondly, the conflicts - or what Veresov (2004) refers to as 'dramatical collisions' - are scaffolds that could lead to powerful and deep learning. I was delighted to see that role-play and drama are also receiving attention in this book, and this gives further momentum to the new drive of speaking of STEAMIE (science, technology, engineering, arts, mathematics, innovation  and  entrepreneurship)  education,  in  contrast  to  the  previous STEM  (science,  technology,  engineering  and  mathematics)  approaches. Research shows that role-play holds affordances to assist critical reflection and facilitate conceptual (deep) understanding (Sogunro 2004).

A  corpus  of  research  shows  that  problem-based  and  cooperative learning approaches could enhance SDL. In the complex 21st century in which we live, SDL should be enhanced to ensure that people develop the skills to adjust to an ever-changing world. The chapters in this book provide a holistic perspective on SDL by focusing on the different dimensions in the person-process-context (PPC) model of Hiemstra and Brockett (2012). Light is shed on the personal attributes that should be underpinning the self-directed  learner  ('person'  dimension),  the  affordances  of  engaging pedagogies during teaching and learning ('process'), as well as the context that  best  facilitates  SDL,  for  example,  confronting  the  learner  with  an authentic, real-life problem that should be investigated.

The research contribution of this book to the transformed knowledge project is significant, as it alerts the reader to consider the affordances of engaging pedagogies for developing SDL in the era of the Fourth Industrial Revolution  (4IR).  This  complex  era,  characterised  by  rapid  changes  in molecular biology and gene editing, AI, advanced robotics and changes in societal patterns, asks for creative and critical thinking. This book's leitmotif is that young learners, used to social media and gamification, would gain much from engaging pedagogies. It poses a challenge to the schooling sector and higher education institutions (HEIs) to rethink their pedagogies. The  chapters  -  both  through  empirical  data  and  systematic  literature reviews - provide a 'thick description' (Geertz 1973) that illuminates the complexity of teaching and learning in a complex 21st century.

This academic book focuses on scholarly research contextualising innovative learning and  knowledge  construction  by  applying  active teaching-learning  practices  such  as  problem-based  learning  (PBL)  and pedagogy of play (PoP) to enhance self-directed learning (SDL). In support of  the  rationale  of  this  book,  PBL  and  pedagogies  of  play  (PoPs)  are discussed in terms of SDL in some theoretical chapters, followed by several chapters reporting on authentic learning practices in various disciplines. This book focuses on practices where students develop SDL abilities to thrive in the 21st century by utilising the abovementioned strategies and contributing  to  essential  skills  for  future  demands.  Moreover,  this  focus supports the aim of this book: Exploring the convergence of PBL, PoP and SDL within the school classroom and higher education (HE) contexts.

The rationale for this book relates to the increasing need for effective ways  to  support  the  development  of  self-directedness  within  different educational contexts. Despite SDL being regarded as an intuitive activity, it is evident that not all learners act effectively in this way (Lapidow &amp; Walker 2022).  As  the  broader  discourse  on  PBL  has  shown,  PBL  can  improve critical thinking  skills,  problem-solving  and  the  development  of  SDL (Manuaba, No &amp; Wu 2022). Consequently, the proposed approach in this book relating to PBL is essential for the 21st-century classroom and the skills required in this dynamic and evolving context. Similarly, employing SDL shows a mediating effect as a critical requirement for PBL (Song, Lee &amp; Lee 2022).

As PoPs are also considered explicitly in this book, it is important to note that increased use and availability of technology allow for opportunities around the role of play in the learning process. In this book, this aspect of play is explicitly approached in terms of PoP. From the literature, overtly supporting PoP through the integration of authentic play experiences may support student-teacher advocacy and the support of PoP in their own

classrooms in the future (Galbraith 2022). It is also clear that play and, by implication  also,  PoP  are  essential  in  different  areas  of  development  of learners (Galbraith 2022). The rapid rise in interest and use of digital gaming also  supports  the  increased  relevance  of  PoP  in  the  educational  sphere while considering the relevant critical game literacies required (Coopilton 2022).  As  evident  from  empirical  research,  such  gamification  strategies also support learners' SDL (Palaniappan &amp; Noor 2022). In order to explore the  intersections  between  PBL,  PoP  and  SDL  further,  this  book  brings together ten unique chapters approaching these topics conceptually and empirically from different angles.

A short overview of the relevant chapters is presented to unpack this book's focus further. In Chapter 1, PBL is outlined as an innovative teaching and learning strategy that enables students to develop 21st-century skills and SDL abilities. According to this chapter, strategies such as PoP can be integrated to foster critical and creative thinking and problem-solving. In playing  certain  types  of  games,  the  players  need  to  solve  ill-structured problems with similar learning conditions and outcomes as PBL.

In the second chapter, the notion of 'Pedagogy of play' emphasises the educational benefits of play by arguing that play describes the two essential principles  at  the  foundation  of  education:  Spontaneous  and  natural direction, on the one hand, and intention, on the other hand. This chapter outlines the theoretical foundation of PoP and the links to developing SDL. Furthermore, the chapter delineates the various PoP strategies, such as puppetry, drama and storytelling, game-based  learning (GBL) and gamification, as well as LEGO® and robotics.

The third chapter focuses on metaliteracy and emphasises the reflective and self-directed individual through domains of learning, learner roles and characteristics, as well as goals and learning objectives. These components offer  opportunities  to  highlight  problem-based  PoP  as  mechanisms  of learning  and  engagement.  Following  the  conceptual  exploration  of  the relationships  amongst  PoPs,  SDL,  PBL  and  metaliteracy,  the  authors examined  multimodal  pedagogies  of  play  where  these  connections  are evident.

With the focus on playful problem-based learning (PPBL), Chapter 4 emphasises that educators in such environments must cultivate a positive attitude towards fostering SDL skills within each student's capacity so that learning  can  be  experienced  as  meaningful.  Furthermore,  within  these PPBL environments, educators must create fun, authentic and meaningful learning opportunities that will enable students to thrive.

Chapter 5 relates to PPBL  and highlights the development of computational thinking (CT) as an essential skill for the Fourth Industrial

Revolution  (4IR).  The  notion  of  CT  involves  various  thought  processes associated  with  solving  real-world  problems  based  on  the  attributes  of computer  science.  This  chapter  investigates  the  active  engagement  of mathematics education students in Scratch game-based tasks to develop their  CT  skills.  In  addition,  some  affordances  related  to  CT  were  the development of several SDL skills.

Geometry remains a challenge for the majority of learners from primary school  onwards.  In  Chapter  6,  learners  are  motivated  to  develop  their abstractions and concretise their knowledge of geometry for SDL. Problembased  pedagogical  sequences  were  developed  in  coding  based  on  the LOGO pedagogical environment. Moreover, fostering SDL via coding can be  optimised  through  learner  involvement,  leading  to  improvements  in their abstractions, which finally develop their mathematical skills.

In Chapter 7, the authors present a design approach to address the issue of moving from and to verbal representations by using learner-generated puzzles with the help of interactive simulations for learning linear equations. Puzzles can be a great source of learning mathematics. The learners created puzzles independently and posted them on the interactive platforms for their peers to solve. The ability to create and solve puzzles independently has strong elements of self-directedness.

Chapter  8  relates  to  the  application  of  LEGO®  to  promote  SDL.  In realising the need to align teacher-training with the development of critical 21st-century  skills,  the  authors  provided  for  the  inclusion  of  the  LEGO® Foundation's Six BRICKS initiative activities as part of our teaching practice curriculum  for  first-year  students.  Through  various  engaging  LEGO® activities, students were guided in PBL, PoP and SDL as they dealt with the real-world challenge of professional identity formation.

Chapter 9 focuses specifically on drama-based pedagogy (DBP) as a form  of  PoP  as  a  vehicle  to  promote  student  learning  of  concepts  and principles,  as  opposed  to  direct  instruction  of  facts  and  concepts.  This chapter focuses on implementing DBP as an intervention for poetry studies in  a  multicultural  Grade  12  classroom  and  promoting  SDL  and  learners' motivation in learning.

Finally, Chapter 10 aims to provide insight into the study of educational robotics  (ER)  for  PPBL  using  third-generation  cultural-historical  activity theory  (CHAT)  as  a  research  lens.  Educational  robotics  is  essential  for developing digital skills, critical thinking and collaborative problem-solving, initiative, autonomy and CT. Teacher-training programmes should expose pre-service teachers to ER to support and prepare them to acquire content and pedagogical knowledge  and  provide professional development opportunities.

With the 4IR in mind, education institutions must rethink teaching and learning  for  active,  innovative  involvement  in  this  field.  As  such,  as  is evident  in  these  chapters,  active  engagement  can  be  encouraged  by implementing  PBL  and  PoPs,  as  evidenced  in  this  book.  This  book contributes to the scholarship of SDL with the integration of PBL and PoP and recommendations on how these strategies can enhance SDL for future challenges that may arise.

## Abstract

Active  learning  embedded  in  constructivism  has  been  associated  with developing  higher-order  thinking  skills  (HoTS).  In  the  literature,  special mention is made of problem-based learning (PBL) that can cultivate, foster and develop HoTS in higher education institutions (HEIs) and schools, as learning  is  focused  on  real-world  problems.  However,  educators  and teachers must ensure they know what PBL entails before implementing it in their subjects. This conceptual chapter aims to provide an overview of PBL to foster meaningful learning.

## Introduction

Problem-based learning enables university students and school learners to  develop  21st-century  skills,  such  as  self-directed  learning  (SDL), problem-solving, critical thinking, collaboration and  communication (Hussin, Harun &amp; Shukor 2019, p. 20; Koh et al. 2019, p. 18). Problem-based learning follows a social-constructivist approach where students construct their  knowledge  through  finding  solutions  to  real-world,  ill-structured problems  in  a  collaborative  learning  environment  (Scheer,  Noweski  &amp; Meinel 2012, p. 8). As PBL focuses on problem-solving skills, other teaching and learning strategies, such as pedagogies of play (PoPs), can integrate a PBL approach to help foster meaningful learning (Kek &amp; Huizer 2017, p. 31). In PoPs, the learners who acted as players need to find solutions to problems with similar learning conditions and objectives as PBL (Pyle &amp; Danniels 2017, p. 277).

In a PBL environment, student learning centres on a 'real-world problem with more than one solution' (Savin-Baden 2008, p. 8). The teacher in a PBL environment acts as a facilitator or guide to assist the PBL process, using  appropriate  methods  and  scaffolds.  However,  with  time,  the facilitator should use fewer scaffolds and challenge the students to learn independently (Schmidt, Rotgans &amp; Yew 2011, p. 797). In this conceptual chapter, PBL  will be  discussed  in  detail concerning  the  historical development of PBL, definitions of PBL, the PBL process, PBL formats, PBL and SDL, roles of the facilitator and students in PBL tutorials, scaffolds in  PBL,  assessment  in  PBL,  different  types  of  PBL  problems,  PBL  and PoPs, as well as the advantages and challenges of PBL. It is necessary to point out that a literature review involving researching, reading, analysing and  summarising  scholarly  literature  about  PBL  was  done  through computer-accessible databases.

## Historical development of problem-based learning

Problem-based learning originated nearly six decades ago as an alternative to direct lecture-centred instruction in medical education (Loyens, Magda &amp; Rikers 2008, p. 412). To overcome the perceived challenges and failings of  the  traditional  direct  instruction  approach,  McMaster  University  in Hamilton,  Ontario,  Canada,  implemented  PBL  as  an  innovative  active teaching  and  learning  approach  to  medical  education  (Tan  2005).  As highlighted by Barrows (2000), the reason for this was that a traditional, direct lecture-centred instructional approach  did not contribute to developing  students' HoTS  (Albanese  &amp;  Mitchell 1993, p. 52). The implementation of PBL emphasises a shift from passive to active learning.

Therefore,  the  student  takes  responsibility  for  their  learning,  while  the lecturer  or  teacher  would  fulfil  a  facilitation  role.  Moreover,  with  the implementation of PBL, students would have to search for information in problem-based scenarios, whereafter lecturers could assess their abilities to use theoretical knowledge to formulate solutions to a problem. It was necessary to develop PBL activities to optimise student learning experiences (Barrows  2000).  It  was  clear  that  PBL  would  promote  learner-centred multidisciplinary  education  (Barrows &amp; Tamblyn 1980), helping to foster lifelong learning and SDL (Hussin et al. 2019, p. 20).

Problem-based  learning  has  expanded  to  subject  areas  such  as pharmacy, engineering, nursing, law, business education, mathematics and science in higher education (HE) (Kong et al. 2014, p. 459; Walker &amp; Leary 2009,  p.  12),  as  well  as  physical  therapy,  advertising  and  architecture (Zakaria, Maat &amp; Khalid 2019, p. 2672). However, the implementation of PBL in  teacher  education  and  school  education  has  only  gained  momentum over  the  last  few  decades  (Borhan  2014,  p.  76;  De  Simone  2014,  p.  17; Golightly 2018, p. 460; Golightly &amp; Muniz 2013, p. 432; Morgado &amp; Leite 2013, p. 2343). In a South African context, PBL was introduced to HEIs and colleges from European and American tertiary institutions (Dolmans et al. 2005, p. 734).

## Definition of problem-based learning

In literature, various definitions of PBL are reported. Torp and Sage (2002) state  that  PBL  focuses  on  research,  discussions  and  solving  real-world problems. Similarly, MacDonald and Savin-Baden (2004, p. 13) state that in PBL the emphasis is on organising the module content, focusing on case studies or scenarios, while Savery (2006, p. 9) defines PBL as a method that requires formulating sound or practical solutions to some real-world issues through doing self-directed research for information. More recent definitions  of  PBL  describe  it  as  an  approach  that  uses  problems  to encourage  students  to  acquire  knowledge  of  a  discipline  or  subject (Lapuz &amp; Fulgencio 2020) or as a learner-centred teaching and learning approach that challenges students to do a self-directed search of sources, and then apply their acquired knowledge to formulate possible solutions to a real-world problem (Corrêa &amp; Martins 2016, p. 159). This chapter will refer to the definition of Torp and Sage (2002).

## Key features of problem-based learning

Problem-based learning promotes active learning in a social-constructivist setting  where  students  construct  their  own  knowledge  by  working collaboratively in PBL groups (Allen, Donham &amp; Bernhardt 2011, p. 22).

Salinitri,  Wilhelm  and  Crabtree  (2015,  p.  74)  as  well  as  De  Graaff  and Kolmos (2003, p. 658) highlight some of the key features of PBL, including that  students  must  solve  real-world  problems  to  foster  meaningful learning, collaborate in small groups, are supported by facilitators, and participate  in  self-directed  research  and  self-study  to  find  solutions  to real-world problems.

In PBL, the problems should be ill-structured, meaning that the problem must have multiple solutions or answers (Hmelo-Silver &amp; Barrows 2006, p.  24;  Sockalingam  2015).  The  problems  must  be  authentic,  challenging and complex (Hmelo-Silver, Duncan &amp; Chinn 2007, p. 100) and mainly in the form  of  real-world  PBL  scenarios  or  case  studies  (Selçuk  2015,  p.  4). Through  the  solving  of  problems,  the  students  acquire  the  necessary knowledge and understanding of the content (Savin-Baden 2008, p. 8). Tan  (2005)  and  Ellingsen  et  al.  (2021)  point  out  that  the  use  of  crossdisciplinary  knowledge  to  provide  solutions  to  the  problem  is  also  a prominent  characteristic of PBL  and  that  students  must  take  into consideration knowledge from various disciplines, subjects and topics.

As mentioned earlier, in PBL environments, learning is student-centred (Selçuk 2015, p. 3). Another PBL feature is that students have to collaborate in  their  PBL  groups,  where  they  engage  as  problem-solvers  and  work together  towards  addressing  the  formulated  learning  issues  to  provide solutions to the stated problems (Torp &amp; Sage 2002). In their respective PBL groups, the group members must determine what the problem is, then formulate learning issues, get involved in self-directed research, use the self-researched information to provide solutions to the problem and then do  self-assessment  as  to  whether  they  achieved  the  learning  issues (De  Simone  2014,  p.  18). The  importance  of  collaborative  learning environments is that they can give rise to the multiple perspectives, views and  ideas  of  group  members  that  can  contribute  to  the  formulation  of more realistic and meaningful solutions (Hmelo-Silver et al. 2007, p. 101).

## The problem-based learning process

In the literature, researchers state that there are various approaches to the PBL process. In this section, reference will be made to the 'Seven Jump' approach that was developed by Schmidt and Moust (2000):

- · Step 1: Identify the concepts and ensure learners understand the stated problem.
- · Step 2: Ask questions about the problem so that the learners understand the problem better.
- · Step 3: In their PBL groups, learners discuss what they know and do not know about the problem.

- · Step 4: Analyse and organise the group discussion findings in Step 3.
- · Step 5: Formulate the learning objectives for further self-directed research.
- · Step 6: All group members collect information through an independent search for resources.
- · Step 7: Discuss the findings of the group members and provide possible solutions to the stated PBL.

Kek and Huijser (2011, p. 336) distinguish between three stages in the PBL process aligned with Schmidt and Moust's (2000) PBL process steps. The first  stage  includes  the  analysis  of  the  problem  and  then  formulating the  learning  objectives  to  assist  students  in  solving  the  problem.  The second research stage allows group members to do self-directed research for  independent  learning,  whereafter  they  apply  their  knowledge  in  the PBL tutorial sessions. During these sessions, group members must assess and reflect on their knowledge in solving the problem. During the third stage,  group  members  share  their  information  with  the  other  group members.  Group  members  must  assess  their  learning  performance  and contribution to the PBL activity.

## Problem-based learning formats

In  literature,  different  PBL  formats  or  models  are  reported  in  tertiary institutions. However, in this chapter, reference will be made to pure, hybrid and integrated PBL formats. In the pure PBL format, PBL is implemented throughout the entire curriculum. In this format, a skillful facilitator guides and supports students collaborating in PBL groups. The group members are  expected  to  apply  SDL  in  solving  the  stated  problem  (Savin-Baden 2008, p. 10).

In a hybrid PBL format, traditional teacher-centred 'instructional methods,  such  as  mini-lectures  and  demonstrations'  are  used  to  guide group  members  in  solving  the  problem  (Carrió  et  al.  2016,  p.  2).  The inclusion  of  the  mini-lectures  and  demonstrations  by  the  facilitator  can be seen as scaffolds to provide support to the group members during the PBL process (Fukuzawa, Boyd &amp; Cahn 2017, p. 182).

In  an integrated PBL format,  PBL  is  embedded  in  a  teacher-centred instructional curriculum for a few days or weeks and can be either a pure or a hybrid format (Golightly 2018, p. 464; Kivela &amp; Kivela 2005, p. 437).

## Problem-based learning and self-directed learning

In PBL, SDL is often seen as a core element (Schmidt et al. 2011, p. 38). However, it is necessary first to define the concept of SDL. In literature, one

of the most well-known definitions for SDL is that of Knowles (1975), who defines SDL as:

A process in which individuals take the initiative, with or without the help of others, in diagnosing their learning needs, formulating learning goals, identifying human  and  material  resources  for  learning,  choosing  and  implementing appropriate learning strategies, and evaluating learning outcomes. (p. 18)

In this regard, Francom (2010, p. 30) points out that SDL students must be able  to  formulate  their  learning  intentions  by  implementing  learning strategies and self-directed research of resources to assess and reflect on their learning. Unsurprisingly, Savery (2015, p. 8) points out the fostering of students' SDL skills when implementing PBL, as they are challenged to take ownership of their own learning (Bidokht &amp; Assareh 2011, p. 1446). Some of the PBL features that promote the enhancement of students' skills to learn on their own are highlighted by Hmelo and Lin (2000) and Loyens et al. (2008, p. 413), namely that PBL environments are characterised by their learner-centredness, problem-solving, formulation of learning issues, selfdirected search for knowledge, self-study, self-assessment and monitoring and collaboration between group members.

From the literature, it is also clear that the PBL formats can influence students' SDL skills differently. A pure PBL format is more likely to improve students' development of SDL skills compared to other PBL formats, where the facilitator provides the group members with more support and guidance (Lee,  Mann  &amp;  Frank  2010,  p.  426).  In  literature,  most  studies  have  been reported with pure PBL curricula to foster students' SDL skills (Gadicherla et al. 2022, p. 975; Koh et al. 2019). However, the evidence regarding the influence of the integrated PBL format on students' SDL skills is inconclusive. In this regard, Walker and Lofton (2003, p. 71) report a decrease in PBL students' SDL scores, Golightly and Guglielmino (2015, p. 73) found no real influence of PBL on students' SDL scores, while Aziz et al. (2014, p. 135) found an increase in students' SDL scores.

Regarding the impact of hybrid PBL on students' SDL skills, Lee et al. (2010, p. 434)  found  no  influence  on  students' SDL  skills after implementing  a  hybrid  PBL  intervention.  At  the  same  time,  Benadé (2020) and Mulaudzi (2021) report that hybrid PBL positively influenced some students' SDL skills.

## The role of facilitators and students in problem-based learning tutorials

In a PBL environment, the lecturer fulfils the role of a facilitator and should plan and design real-world ill-structured problems that can help achieve the set lesson objectives (Woods 2006). The facilitator supports, facilitates

and inspires group members to embrace the PBL process (Savery 2019) and effectively assists students in collaborating in their groups (Goh 2014, p. 163). To achieve this, the facilitator must develop procedural guidelines that  promote  group  interactions  and  collaboration  within  PBL  tutorial sessions (Chuan et al. 2011, p. 397). The facilitator, through questioning and didactic conversations  in  the  various  PBL  groups,  fosters  students' metacognitive thinking skills (Goh 2014, p. 163; Savery 2019, p. 88). They can, if necessary, provide group members with relevant resources that can assist them in solving the stated problem (De Simone 2014, p. 19). With time,  the  facilitator  should  provide  less  guidance  and  assistance  until members can learn on their own (Hmelo-Silver &amp; Barrows 2006, p. 24). In this regard it is essential that the facilitator must be able to guide and assist members and know when to withhold feedback and guidance to develop members' SDL skills (Ertmer &amp; Glazewski 2019).

It is expected of the facilitator to evaluate the members' progress and to assess their PBL reports and presentations (De Simone 2014, p. 19). In PBL environments,  the  facilitator  must  assist  members  in  managing  their learning time so that they submit the PBL tasks by the deadline (Grant 2011, p. 52) and create a good learning community between the facilitator and students.  Against  this  background,  Lockspeiser  et  al.  (2008,  p.  368) highlight three characteristics of the facilitator that can improve students' learning in  a  PBL  environment: being an expert in their field, as well as social and  cognitive  congruence.  Facilitators with sufficient subject knowledge can provide effective support and guidance and ask relevant questions  during  the  tutorial  sessions.  Regarding  social  and  cognitive congruence, it is essential that the facilitator shows interest in their students' well-being and a desire for them to succeed. The facilitator should have the skills to communicate on a level the students will understand.

In PBL environments, the students are actively involved in the learning process and become 'active constructors of their knowledge' (Dahms &amp; Zakaria  2015).  The  focus  is  on  collaboration  and  good  communication between group members in tutorial sessions (Grant 2011, p. 63). Students collaborate in groups of four-six (Kolmos 2008). After the members receive the  problem,  they  must  formulate  the  learning  issues.  Afterwards,  each group member must do individual self-directed research to find relevant resources  online  or  in  the  library.  Group  members  must  then  share  and discuss  their  researched  findings  with  fellow  members.  This  interaction between  members  is  vital  as  it  can  contribute  to  the  development  of problem-solving, critical thinking, collaboration and communication skills (Koh et al. 2019, p. 18). It is also necessary for members to be involved in self-  and  peer-assessment  to  monitor  what  they  have  learnt  and  each group member's contribution to solving the problem (Savery 2015).

## Scaffolds in problem-based learning environments

In PBL environments, students must learn on their own to enhance their SDL skills. However, the facilitator still plays an essential role in designing a PBL  environment  to  support  and  guide  students  during  the  learning process  (English  &amp;  Kitsantas  2013,  p.  130;  Varadarajan  &amp;  Ladage  2022, p. 159). Therefore, the facilitator must use various scaffolds that support students in their groups to successfully achieve the learning issues (Ertmer &amp; Glazewski 2015; Yeung 2010, p. 196).

Different  scaffolds  will  be  used  in  the  students'  different  learning contexts  and  can  take  various  forms  (Simons  &amp;  Klein  2007,  p.  44).  In literature, a distinction is made between hard and soft scaffolds (Ertmer &amp; Glazewski 2019). Hard scaffolds provide assistance, support and guidance with  possible  challenges  that  members  may  experience  in  solving  the problem (Choo 2012; Moallem &amp; Igoe 2020). These scaffolds may include student  guides,  training  PBL  videos,  prescribed  learning  materials  or resources, guiding templates, worksheets and assessment rubrics (Choo 2012; Yeung 2010, p. 192). Interestingly, students usually consult most of the intricate scaffolds before beginning the PBL activity (Choo 2012). In contrast,  soft  scaffolds  in  PBL  environments  provide  in-the-moment support and guidance during the tutorial sessions, such as discussions and debates between the different role-players (Moallem &amp; Igoe 2020; Schmidt et  al.  2011,  p.  797).  During  the  PBL  tutorial  sessions,  the  soft  scaffolds include  the  facilitator's  comments  on  the  group's  performance,  asking pertinent questions, offering suggestions, hints and clues to assist them in solving  the  problem  (Preus  2012,  p.  59),  and  promoting  collaboration among  members  (Caesar  et  al.  2016,  p.  56).  Interestingly,  in  his  study, Golightly (2021b, p. 12) reports that 'pre-service geography teachers in a South African context rated soft scaffolds as having a greater impact on their learning compared to hard scaffolds'.

## Assessment in problem-based learning

Assessment should be planned as an integrated part of all  activities  to ensure  that  it  is  embedded  throughout  the  PBL  process.  Savery  (2019) states that assessment in PBL should be both knowledge- and processbased. Therefore, the integration and development of various assessments of, for and as learning strategies are important in providing feedback on students' and learners' subject knowledge and skills, as well as mastery of higher-order cognitive skills (Lu, Bridges &amp; Hmelo-Silver 2014, p. 299).

In the assessment of learning, the facilitator mostly uses an assessment rubric to identify students' 'core competencies and essential skills', including

'attitude  and  punctuality,  preparedness,  participation,  knowledge,  group skills, problem-solving skills, critical thinking and the relevance of resources' (Ibrahim &amp; Al-Shahrani 2018, p. 84). Assessment of learning tasks used by a facilitator can take the form of assessing group members' contribution and performance in solving the problem (Sim et al. 2006, p. 636), the PBL report compiled by the group, the PBL portfolio of a group member or a presentation  of the stated solutions that generally occur  following submission  of  the  report.  The  assessor  must  collect  evidence  to  either compare or numerically rate the group members (Albanese &amp; Hinman 2019, pp. 398-404).

Assessment  for  learning  is  the  assessment  process  that  is  being integrated  with  the  PBL  process  and  supporting  and  guiding  each member's  learning  (Schuwirth  &amp;  Van  der  Vleuten  2011,  p.  478).  The formative assessment informs group members on how to adjust learning strategies to improve the future acquisition of knowledge through solving the  stated  problem  (Li  &amp;  De  Luca  2014,  p.  378).  The  facilitator  gives feedback on the groups' performances, explicitly referring to members' preparation  for  a  tutorial  session,  formulating  and  clarifying  learning issues, knowledge about the problem, communication, attitude, working in groups, leadership and self-assessment skills (Mubuuke, Louw &amp; Van Schalkwyk 2016; Siarova, Sternadel &amp; Mašidlauskaitė 2017, p. 37). Feedback can help to develop a member's ability and skills to learn on their own (Clark 2012, p. 217). Albanese and Hinman (2019, p. 393) point out that assessment rubrics are important tools in providing feedback to students in PBL environments.

As  students  are  responsible  for  their  learning  in  PBL  contexts,  it  is important to involve them in the assessing process (MacDonald &amp; SavinBaden  2004,  p.  8).  Therefore,  in  assessment  as  learning,  the  members are  responsible  for  assessing  their  and  their  peers'  performances  and contributions in solving the problem (Siarova et al. 2017, p. 40), to challenge group  members  to  develop  their  monitoring  and  self-assessment  skills (Koh et al. 2019, p. 19) and improve their metacognitive skills. Therefore, facilitators  must  equip  members  with  critical  assessment  skills  to  give feedback  on  their  learning  and  contributions  to  PBL  using  assessment rubrics or checklists (Sridharan &amp; Boud 2019, p. 900).

## Different types of problem-based learning problems

Solving problems in real-world contexts is significant in PBL (Sebatana &amp; Dudu 2022). As a problem initiates the learning process, the quality of problems is crucial for meaningful learning (Sockalingam &amp; Schmidt 2011).

According to Van den Hurk et al. (1999), the quality of the problems has an influence on the formulation of relevant learning objectives as well as students' self-directed activities. A problem must be situated in real-life contexts, which allows students to construct their own  meaning, consequently  linking  the  prescribed  curriculum  content  within  their contexts. A PBL problem must be inherently interdisciplinary (Brassler &amp; Dettmers 2017; Gallagher et al. 1995) so that learners can apply some of the content pieces of knowledge from various subjects and disciplines. According to Jonassen (2011), when designing a PBL problem, aspects to consider  include  structure,  difficulty  and  context  based  on  the characteristics  of  students.  In  this  regard,  the  author  identified  the following problems as ill-structured, namely 'decision-making problems, troubleshooting problems, diagnosis-solution problems, situated cases/ policy problems, design problems and dilemmas' (Jonassen 2000, p. 76). Interestingly, Jonassen and Hung (2008) concluded that 'decision-making problems should be used as the problem focus of PBL' (Jonassen &amp; Hung 2008, p. 21). An example of a PBL decision-making problem is presented by Golightly (2018):

South Africa is a water-scarce country and we need to manage water properly. To  encourage  the  different  municipalities  to  improve  the  quality  of  drinking water  and  water  sources,  the  Department  of  Water  Affairs  annually  awards Blue  and  Green  Drop  status  to  municipalities  for  the  effective  treatment and monitoring of drinking water, as well as the management of responsible water  consumption  and  maintenance  of  services.  The  Tlokwe  municipality (Potchefstroom) has for the past few years received the Blue as well as the Green Drop award. However, the question remains as to the quality of the water in the Mooi River in Potchefstroom. The local newspaper asks you, as geography student, to determine the water quality of the river by using miniSASS [ sic .] and, if necessary, to make recommendations to the local government on how to improve the river's water quality. (p. 465)

## The design of problems

One of the important knowledge areas to possess about PBL is designing such problems (Sockalingam 2015). In this regard, Dolmans et al. (1997) list several principles to plan and design problems, these being that PBL problems should relate to the real world, promote collaboration between group  members,  promote  knowledge  integration,  foster  SDL,  deal  with students' prior knowledge,  evoke  students'  interest  and  reflect  the educational  institution's  objectives.  Hung  (2019)  also  points  out  that ineffective PBL problem designs can lead to insufficient content knowledge coverage by the students when solving the problem.

The Stanford University Newsletter on Teaching (2001, p. 4) outlines four steps or phases in formalising the PBL problem: Step 1: Exploration

or  experimentation ,  where  the  problem  is  presented  to  the  students. Step  2: Sustainability , where  the  problem  is  revised  after  learners' feedback.  Step  3: Institutionalisation , which  refers  to  whether  the problem  is  meaningful  for  the  industry  or  the  subject  area.  Step  4: Reinvention , where changes are made to the problem so that it keeps up with new information, topics and developments in the domain.

The  findings  of  Sockalingam  and  Schmidt  (2011)  show  that  students believed that the problem's title must be aligned with the learning objectives and  that  the  students  must  be  familiar  with  the  problem  context.  They further state that the problem can have keywords and pictures to provide further support and guidance to the students in solving the stated problem. Sockalingam  and  Schmidt  (2011,  pp.  18-19)  conceptualised  their  study findings into two groups: 'feature', which refers to the problem's design elements, and 'function', which refers to desired learning objectives when solving the problem.

According to Sockalingam  and Schmidt  (2011, p. 20), the PBL characteristics refer to 'characteristics that are the design elements of the problems.  Characteristics  such  as  problem  format,  clarity,  familiarity, difficulty, and relevance (application and use) are the design elements of problems'.  The  problem  format  states  how  the  facilitator  presents  the problem to the group members because problems may use known phrases (in  science,  which  might  be  principles,  theories  or  laws),  scenario  texts, pictures or cartoons, and interactive simulations. Problem clarity concerns whether the problem highlights hints and clues of the intended content for teaching and learning, while familiarity pertains to whether the problem is aligned with students' prior knowledge and interests (Dos Santos 2017). Another  feature  characteristic  concerns  the  level  of  difficulty  of  a  PBL problem - which must be suitable for the students' level and the depth to  which intended content must be taught and learnt (Hung 2019). The PBL problem must also be of relevance for students' application, either in the classroom for a better conceptualisation of the content or in their day-to-day activities (Dos Santos 2017).

Concerning the functional features of a good problem, it is necessary for the problem to stimulate and promote students' critical reasoning, SDL, elaboration and teamwork, and it must assist in achieving the identified learning objectives (Dos Santos 2017; Sockalingam &amp; Schmidt 2011, p. 20). In other words, a PBL problem must help promote the 4C's - critical thinking (for  reasoning),  collaboration  (teamwork),  communication  (elaboration) and creativity (achieving learning objectives) - to provide good solutions to the stated problem. The other functional characteristic is SDL, where students take responsibility for their learning, aligning with Knowles's SDL definition (Robinson &amp; Persky 2020).

Hung (2006) proposes a conceptual framework for problem design as a theoretical 3C3R model. More recently, Hung (2019) refined his 2006 model and  called  it  'The  second  generation  of  the  3C3R  PBL  problem  design model' (see Figure 1.1).

The second generation 3C3R model represents three core components: 'core, processing and enhancing' (Hung 2019, p. 252). Regarding Figure 1.1, the core components refer to 'content, context, and connection', which refer to  'the  students'  content  and  conceptual  learning',  while  the  process components, namely 'researching, reasoning, and reflecting' (see Figure 1.1), refer  to  the  students'  thinking  processes  and  skills  in  solving  real-world problems  (Hung  2019,  p.  252).  Enhancing  components  comprise  affect, difficulty and teamwork. According to Hung (2019), enhancing components may influence individual motivation, engagement, SDL and shared learning. Regarding  core  components,  the  PBL  problem  must  show  the  intended content and its connection with the context in which students are exposed. The process components suggest that the PBL problem must encourage students to research additional information and use their reasoning skills and critical reflection to solve it.

## Advantages and challenges of the implementation of problem-based learning

In  literature,  various  studies  highlight  the  advantages  of  PBL.  Some  of the most important advantages of PBL will be discussed in this section.

In  this  regard,  Koh  and  Chapman  (2019)  point  out  that  PBL  promotes real-world  learning  of  disciplinary  content  knowledge  and  professional competence. Ali (2019) and Baran (2016) report that PBL facilitates the acquisition of content knowledge and the fostering of 21st-century skills (Hussin  et  al.  2019,  p.  20;  Kek  &amp;  Huijser  2017,  p.  31).  In  other  studies, González (2019) states that PBL increases students' motivation to learn, while  Gilbert  and  Afonso  (2015),  Lee  et  al.  (2010,  p.  425)  as  well  as Golightly  (2021a)  state  that  effective  implementation  of  PBL  activities enhances students' SDL skills.

However, with the implementation of PBL, it can be expected that there will  be  challenges  for  the  facilitator  and  students.  In  this  regard,  Wood (2008)  mentions  that  the  effective  implementation  of  PBL  may  be  a challenge, as well as the design and planning of good PBL problems and activities.  In  addition,  the  Stanford  University  Newsletter  on  Teaching (2001)  states  that  planning  and  designing  PBL  problems  can  be  timeconsuming  but  can  also  assist  and  support  students  in  achieving  their learning goals. According to Aker and Pentón-Herrera (2020), Ceker and Ozdamli (2016) and Dillon et al. (2018), the implementation of PBL can be time-consuming, while Wijnen et al. (2017, p. 4) point out that the new learning environment can be challenging for lecturers and students. Poor implementation of PBL can affect the students' learning in PBL environments and counter the positive advantages of PBL to foster students' HoTS.

Other  challenges  can  include  teachers'  resistance  to  implementing PBL in their classrooms as it increases their workload (Li 2013; Yarnall &amp; Ostrander 2011). Another challenge that may hinder the implementation of PBL is teachers' lack of knowledge and understanding of PBL and how to implement  it  effectively  in  the  curriculum  (Li  2013;  Naji  et  al.  2020). Practically, PBL requires teachers to have the necessary facilitation skills and access to venues and rooms where students can work in their PBL groups (Bestetti et al. 2014).

Some studies also report that collaborative learning in PBL groups can hinder meaningful learning for some group members. Some members may not contribute to some tasks, as it is difficult to assess each group member's contribution to the PBL activity (Golightly 2021a; Golightly &amp; Muniz 2013). It  is  necessary  to  highlight  that  some  students  may  struggle  to  work  in groups with others, while others struggle to decide what is essential to learn  in  a  PBL  environment  (Mansor  et  al.  2015).  In  this  regard,  the effective use of self- and peer-assessment of learners' contributions in PBL environments can help to solve some of the challenges members experience in PBL activities (Golightly 2021a). For some students, it will be challenging to do self-directed research and find and investigate rich learning materials and resources (Tandoğan &amp; Akinoğlu 2007, p. 74). However, it is essential

to mention that it will take time for lecturers, teachers and students to get used to the new role they must fulfil in PBL.

## Problem-based learning and pedagogies of play

As  PBL  focuses  on  problem-solving  skills,  other  teaching  and  learning strategies,  such  as  PoPs,  including  game-based  learning  (GBL),  digital games, drama-based pedagogy (DBP), puzzle-based learning and robotics, can integrate a PBL approach to help foster meaningful learning (Pyle &amp; Danniels 2017, p. 277). In PoPs, the learners, who act as players, can be expected to solve problems with similar learning conditions and outcomes as PBL. Therefore, PoPs mostly consist of a learner-centred exploration of phenomena through playing a game, building a robot or performing (Pyle &amp; Danniels 2017, p. 274). In these learning environments, the teacher can act as the facilitator (Walker &amp; Shelton 2008). In some PoPs, the players can set goals to overcome an obstacle or solve a problem by interacting with fellow players. In playing a physical or digital game, building a robot, solving a puzzle or performing a drama play, the learners will be actively involved in the learning process (Pyle &amp; Danniels 2017). In this regard, Kiili (2007, p. 394) identifies some of the important PBL features that must be included in these PoPs, namely, solving a problem or a challenge, active learning, collaboration and engaging with fellow students, learners setting learning  goals,  doing  self-directed  research,  the  facilitator  providing scaffolding and feedback, content knowledge integrated around problems, students  reflecting  on  their  learning  and  the  facilitator  providing  a debriefing at the end of the learning process (see Figure 1.2).

Some studies in educational, digital and entertainment games reported that  learners  develop  more  effective  problem-solving  skills  in  learnercentred PoP environments than in more formal, teacher-directed settings (Arnott 2016, p. 285). Therefore, it is no surprise that Huang, Hew and Lo (2019,  p.  1106)  believe  that  PoPs,  with  specific  reference  to  educational games, digital  games  and  entertainment  games,  should  be  designed  to include various activities to create an interesting experience and ultimately lead to meaningful learning. In a study by Shahbodin et al. (2013, p. 8), the researchers used a combination of PBL and GBL in mathematics education to assist students in mastering mathematics knowledge. Chang, Chung and Chang (2020, p. 2615) and Darling-Hammond et al. (2020) report that the PBL  approach  to  game-based  and  play-based  learning  can  develop meaningful, active, engaging and socially interactive learning, enhancing satisfaction and enjoyment of the learning process. They further state that PBL  games  provide  facilitators  with  an  effective  teaching  and  learning strategy to foster students' learning satisfaction in computer programming.

Key: PBL, problem-based learning; PoPs, pedagogies of play.

Flood, Heath and Lapp (2015) also highlight that in video- and computerbased games, students must find multiple solutions to a problem.

In literature, educational robotics (ER) can provide an authentic learning context  for  real-life  applications,  and  problems  can  encourage  active learning in various educational environments (Barker et al. 2012). Unsurprisingly,  Ortiz  (2011)  states  that  using  robotics  can  positively influence learners' problem-solving skills, while Witherspoon et al. (2016) also  state  that  using  robotics  can  improve  social  interactions  between learners and the application of knowledge.

In two other PoPs strategies, namely drama-based learning and puzzlebased learning, the integration of a PBL approach can foster meaningful learning. For example, Duman and Özçelik (2018) pointed out that a PBL approach  can  be  used  in  creative  drama  play  to  help  achieve  the  set learning outcomes. The authors reported that the PBL approach followed in  performing a creative drama play which positively affected learners' self-efficacy  abilities.  While  puzzle-based  learning  inherently  solves  a problem,  the  aim  is  to  get  learners  to  find  solutions  to  unstructured problems (Michalewicz, Falkner &amp; Sooriamurthi 2011) and, in the process of  learning,  help  develop  learners'  thinking  skills  and  problem-solving skills (Costa 2017).

It  is  necessary  to  point  out  that  this  chapter  provided  an  overview of  PBL  and  referred  to  some  of  the  important  PBL  features  in  PoPs.

However, in Chapter 2, the theoretical foundation of PoPs (such as puppetry, drama and storytelling, GBL and gamification) and its integration with PBL and SDL will be discussed in detail.

## Conclusion

This chapter's main purpose was to give an overview of PBL. Implementing PBL in HEIs and schools can contribute to students' and learners' abilities to apply their understanding to real-world situations and where they will be able to solve 21st-century problems. However, to effectively implement PBL in programmes, curricula or modules, lecturers and teachers must be certain of what PBL is all about before implementing it in their classrooms. It  is  vital  to  inform  the  students  and  learners  what  PBL  entails  before lecturers  and  teachers  introduce  them  to  PBL.  The  importance  of  the design  and  planning  of  good  problems,  the  role  of  the  teacher  and learners  in  PBL  environments,  the  self-directed  research  for  resources and  materials,  and  the  integration  of  various  assessment  methods  are some  of  the  most  important  features  of  PBL.  Although  students  are actively  involved  in  the  PBL  process,  it  is  of  utmost  necessity  that facilitators can provide the necessary scaffolds to guide the students in the  PBL  process.  The  implementation  of  various  assessment  methods that  are  aligned  with  the  PBL  principles  is  of  importance.  In  a  PBL environment,  the  facilitators  must  take  note  of  the  advantages  and challenges of PBL before they implement PBL activities in their modules. Interestingly,  because  of  the  problem-solving  nature  of  PBL,  it  is  no surprise that PoPs can implement a PBL approach during the learning process to help foster meaningful learning.

## Pedagogy of play: A framework for self-directed learning

## Abstract

The pedagogy of play (PoP) places a focus on the learning advantages of play by asserting that play exemplifies the two fundamental principles at the  heart  of  education:  unintentional,  unstructured  exploration  and intentional, purposeful action. The role of play in children's learning and development  is  one  of  the  cornerstones  of  early  childhood  education (ECE).  Theory  and  ideology  may  be  traced  back  to  early  childhood development (ECD) programmes in a wide range of nations, including the United States of America (USA). Despite the many studies that have been conducted  on  learning  via  play, there has been  surprisingly little investigation into the efficacy of using play in the classroom. Free play and  individual  preference  have  always  complicated  efforts  to  draw parallels between play and learning. Notwithstanding recent theoretical and legal developments, it is now increasingly vital to comprehend the

diverse goals and nature of play in educational settings, as well as the role of  instructors  in  preparing  for  and  being  playful  in  child-initiated  or teacher-directed activity. In this chapter, the focus is on the theory behind PoPs and how it may be used to pave the way for self-directed learning (SDL), puppetry, drama, storytelling, game-based learning (GBL), gamification, LEGO® and robotics are just some of the strategies that will be  outlined  in  this  chapter.  In  conclusion,  a  novel  framework  will  be explained that links SDL with PoPs.

## Introduction

The concept of PoP, as per Lindqvist (1996), became more 'segregated' into specified locations and time slots in many Western countries as the 20th  century  came  to  an  end.  It  was  not  until  after  school  and  on  the playgrounds that learners could have fun and study (Baumer 2013). For teachers (and parents), the division of children's play should be organic and  safeguarded  by  these  designated  'spaces',  as  per  Nilsson  (2009). Wood  (2014)  argues  that  play  may  be  started  by  children,  adults  or policymakers, depending on the context. Instead of encouraging creativity and imaginative play, commercial toys, objects and material culture have taken the role of teachers' (and parents') participation in learners' (and their children's) play (Arnott &amp; Yelland 2020).

Pedagogy  of  play  promotes  collaborative  play  between  adults (teachers or parents) and children in the 21st century, which contrasts with the general tendency (Baumer 2013). When learners begin to play in the classroom, teachers deliver diverse resources, including emotional, cognitive, social and linguistic ones. In the classroom, learners' knowledge,  imagination,  playfulness  and  improvisational  skills  are  all put to the test, resulting in a distinctive teaching-learning interaction (Miyazaki 2010). Most crucially, a number of studies have shown that an increasing number of scholars are dedicated to creating PoP to aid in teaching  crucial  21st-century  skills  (e.g.  Boyle  et  al.  2014;  Dondlinger 2007).  Scholars  are  paying  increasing  attention  to  the  concept  of 21st-century skills, which encompasses a wide range of abilities, including those  related  to  learning  and  innovation,  namely,  critical  thinking, creativity,  collaboration  and  communication,  as  well  as  information, electronic media and technology (Binkley et al. 2014) (e.g. Chan &amp; Yuen 2014;  Gee  2007).  The  primary  goal  of  this  chapter  is  to  explain  the conceptualisation  of  PoP  and  the  various  strategies  that  constitute playful learning. The chapter further seeks to link SDL and PoP, as they have  natural  connections.  This  chapter  is  conceptual  in  nature.  The following  section  pays  specific  attention  to  PoP  and  its  theoretical foundations, the most significant of which is SDL.

## Pedagogy of play

## Theoretical foundations and development

There are two key aspects in the teaching of play, which are both natural and deliberate: (1) spontaneous and natural and (2) intentional (Danniels &amp; Pyle 2018; Farné 2005). The deliberate part of any PoP is generally  focused  on  creating  and  administering  playful  activities  and resources for learners with specific objectives in mind by a teacher (Farné 2005).  To  be  sure,  it  is  not  just  about  playing  games:  PoP  looks  at everything that goes into a play experience from the perspective of its potential and material circumstances, as well as how meaning is formed in settings particular to the game (Farné 2005).

Gunilla Lindqvist invented the term 'pedagogy of play' in the 1980s (Baumer 2013; Lindqvist 1996). Based on Vygotsky's cultural perspective on learners' play,  Lindqvist  stressed  the  necessity  of  play  teaching  in  the  classroom (Baumer 2013). Learners who practice self-control during play will be better able to focus on their studies, according to Vygotsky (1978). He thought play was important because it provided different learning experiences that allowed learners  to  acquire  new  knowledge  (Vygotsky  1967).  Vygotsky's  zone  of proximal development (ZPD) theory states that learners can move beyond their ZPD because PoP helps them experiment with features and behaviours prevalent in their real-world experiences but rarely tested in the classroom.

There are many inventive ways to educate and study in the classroom, and PoP is one of them (Vogt et al. 2018). Various games, such as board and card games, indigenous games (like 'Morabaraba'), puppetry or even video-gaming may be used to teach learners (Bendixen-Noe 2010; Brits, De Beer &amp; Mabotja 2016; Nkopodi &amp; Mosimege 2009; Vogt et al. 2018). Learning in PoP is easy for learners and students because they do not fear any impediments (willing to accept the challenge), and the information is kept and absorbed over time, as per Remer and Tzuriel (2015). Any play pedagogy that hopes to be effective must enable students and learners to participate in the learning process  by  having  fun.  Considering  the characteristics  of  playful  learning,  one  can  tell  whether  the  learner  is engaged by noting the subsequent sub-sections.

## Characteristics of playful learning

A clear picture of what PBL looks like is a critical first step in developing a play-based pedagogy. Both own experiences and those of others, such as theories and perspectives from relevant literature, have helped shape the design of the playful learning indicators that have been developed (Plass et al. 2020).

The definition of these criteria is a work in progress; nonetheless, what is developing is a paradigm of playful learning that incorporates criteria that are divided into three classifications: delight, wonder and choice (Plass et al. 2020). They are intended to characterise the quality of learners' experiences as  they  go  through  comprehension,  knowledge  and  skill  development stages. In order to account for the fact that fun learning has both subjective and  objective  aspects,  the  indicators  indicate  both  psychological  states and  behavioural  manifestations  (Whitton  2018).  Playful  learning  is  most likely occurring when all three categories are 'in play', as depicted by the confluence of the circles in the diagram in Figure 2.1.

The  sensation  of  freedom,  independence,  control,  spontaneity  and intrinsic drive that the playful learner experiences are all part of the choice process.  Depending  on  their  circumstances,  learners  may  have  these sentiments on their own or in a group (Whitton 2018). Collectively making decisions and the associated sensation of belonging to something greater than oneself may help people feel more empowered and in control of their lives. Learners displaying choice, in the eyes of an observer, are choosing objectives, creating and exchanging ideas, creating and altering rules, and managing obstacles (Plass et al. 2020). They are also expected to select collaborators and responsibilities, determine how long they will work or play, and determine when they will move about (Shelley et al. 2019). These are closely linked to SDL, which will be expanded upon further in this chapter.

The realities for children (and, in many cases, adults) is that they seldom have total control over their lives. In schools, there might be conflicts between learner's interests and the aims of adult learning that can occur (Shelley et al. 2019). Most importantly, the perception of choice allows learners to have a sense of autonomy and ownership; they believe they have options to do what they want when they are allowed to do so (Whitton 2018).

Intrigue,  originality,  amazement  and  difficulty  are  all  elements  of  the wonder experience,  and  they  may  engage  and  captivate  the  learner  in various settings (Shelley et al. 2019). If you are an observer, a feeling of wonder entails experimenting and investigating, producing and inventing, pretending and envisioning, and pushing boundaries or learning via trial and error. The ordinary may be transformed into the exceptional via the power of wonder. It is possible to feel a sense of amazement by exploring objects, ideas, viewpoints, music, symbols, words, languages, tales, dance or other ways of expression (Plass et al. 2020).

Excitement, pleasure, contentment, motivation, expectation, confidence and a sense of belonging are all feelings associated with delight. Happy learners may show it by smiling, laughing, making jokes or being foolish (Plass et al. 2020). They could sing, hum or dance, and have a sensation of hygge ,  a  Danish concept that refers to spending quality time with close companions in a comfortable setting. It is possible that they have narrowed their emphasis. Playful rivalry, celebration or participating in an unselfish deed may all provide opportunities to feel delighted.

Researchers are not saying that we do not take our teaching seriously by saying that learning can be fun. Taking education seriously does not mean, however, that learning should be devoid of enjoyment, happiness and pleasure (Shelley et al. 2019). It is indeed regrettable that schools lack a feeling of joy (Whitton 2018). Related to these characteristics of playful learning is the broader learner-centred theories that directly link to any PoP, the core of which is SDL.

## Methodology

This  chapter  is  fundamentally  conceptual  (Hirschheim  2008;  Jaakkola 2020) rather than experimental in nature (Gilson &amp; Goldberg 2015), thus offering a novel conceptual contribution to the application of PoP as an SDL approach.

In  choosing  between  the  different  avenues  conceptual  research  can take,  namely  theory  synthesis,  adaptation  theory,  typology  and  model papers (Jaakkola 2020), the researchers considered this study as a model paper.  Conforming  to  the  guidelines  of  a  model  paper,  the  researchers attempted  to  establish  a  theoretical  framework  for  connecting  ideas

(concepts or constructs) (Jaakkola 2020). The  authors included a representation of the concepts (constructs) of interest in the study (PoP and  SDL),  their  observable  manifestations  and  the  interrelationships between  these  (Delbridge  &amp;  Fiss  2013;  Jaakkola  2020;  MacInnis  2011; Meredith 1993). Additionally, the author unravelled and discovered a novel link (Cornelissen 2017; Fulmer 2012; MacInnis 2011) that advances existing knowledge concerning  the  use  of  a  teaching  approach,  namely  PoP,  to assist teachers in applying SDL in their classrooms.

In order to answer the research question, namely, how can PoP assist in  the  development  of  SDL,  the  author  employed  a  scoping  review (Arksey &amp; O'Malley 2005). According to Arksey and O'Malley (2005), scoping reviews summarise current literature and findings from completed research and are used when a research topic is not yet well understood or to identify knowledge gaps (Munn et al. 2018), as in the case of the present study.

As reporting the results of the scoping review was not the primary goal of  the  current  study  (Peters  et  al.  2015),  only  three  of  the  six  stages proposed by Arksey and O'Malley (2005) were used to guide the scoping review: (1) In defining the research question, (2) locating relevant studies and (3) selecting the best studies.

## Theories linked to pedagogies of play

In light of the increased popularity of learner-centred teaching and learning, existing  education  pedagogies  that  concentrate  on  promoting  learner autonomy, primarily via play, have resurfaced. Self-determination, socialconstructivist  theory,  self-directed  and  self-regulated  learning  (SRL), problem-based learning (PBL) and cooperative learning (CL) are some of the approaches that constitute these pedagogies. Self-directed learning relies  heavily  on  these  pedagogies  because  of  how  they  foster  learner agency via the medium of play. In what follows, we will examine different pedagogies  from  the  student's  perspective  and  how  they  relate  to  the concept of independent study.

## Self-determination

Defined  by  Ryan  and  Deci  (2002),  the  concept  of  self-determination refers  to  the  fact  that  humans  have  a  drive  for  continuous  self-improvement, both  independently  by  regulating  their  own  actions  and  in  respect towards other individuals within social contexts. It is hypothesised that the  human  urge  for  self-improvement  stems  from  three  basic  needs: 'Competence, relatedness, and autonomy' (2002, p. 6).

Motivation, self-regulation, learner autonomy, goal-setting and self-efficacy are  all  important  aspects  of  Ryan  and  Deci's  (2002)  theory.  However, heutagogy incorporates additional principles, such as self-reflection and metacognition,  double-loop  learning  (i.e.  adapting  one's  objectives  or criteria for making  decisions based  on past performance), learner competency and capability, and neuroscientific proof - is the prefrontal cortex's (PFC) control mechanisms that choose and manage goal-relevant information in the learning process - in conjunction with working memory (WM)  and  long-term  memory  (LTM)  of  how  we  learn  (Blaschke  2012; Blaschke &amp; Hase 2016, 2019; Guy &amp; Byrne 2013; Hase &amp; Kenyon 2013).

## Social constructivism

According to social constructivism, knowledge is gained through moving from the familiar to the unfamiliar (Olson &amp; Hergenhahn 2009; Omodan 2022). Dron and Anderson (2014, p. 43) pose that 'the learning process is distinct and dynamic, as well as personal and contextual', 'depending upon their  (the  learner's)  individual  and  communal  understandings,  histories, and tendencies'. Learners are at the heart of the constructivist approach, which is defined by characteristics such as active and genuine learning, scaffolded learning and collaborative learning (Harasim 2017). Incorporating contextual factors into learning activities, encouraging knowledge production,  including  diverse  views,  and  encouraging  interdependence, conversation, engaging interaction, exploration and problem-solving are all important to fulfil the main purpose of learning (Dron &amp; Anderson 2014; Jonassen et al. 1995). Pedagogy of play, where the instructor plays more of a facilitator  role,  scaffolds  the  learning  process  and  leads the learner or student from the familiar to the unfamiliar, has many  traits with constructivism's emphasis on learner discovery, curiosity and open-ended learning. A fluid instead of a passive connection between instructor and learner occurs when learners are participating in their own learning (Hase &amp; Kenyon 2013).

## Self-regulated learning

Self-directed learning is a wider term that incorporates and comprises SRL, where the self-directed learner is expected to self-regulate; however, SRL does not encompass SDL completely (Loyens 2008; Saks 2014). According to Zimmerman and Schunk (2001):

- […]  Learners  are  self-regulated  to  the  extent  that  they  are  meta-cognitively, motivationally,  and  behaviourally  active  participants  in  their  own  learning process […] Learners check the success of their learning techniques or tactics and react to this 'feedback' in self-regulation learning. (p. 5)

When learning is self-regulated, the primary emphasis is on the learner's capacity to evaluate and adjust their learning strategy in response to their own personal learning needs.

Regarding education, Bandura et al. (2001) found that most of it is learnt via  observation  and  comparing  one's  behaviour  to  established  norms. A positive evaluation occurs if a person's behaviour meets or exceeds one's performance requirements; on the other hand, a negative evaluation occurs if it  misses  the  mark  of  one's  expectations.  Perceived  self-efficacy  is similarly  shaped  by  one's  own  successes  and  failures,  both  real  and imagined,  as  cited  in  Hergenhan  and  Olson  (2009).  There  are  many similarities  between  an  SRL  and  SDL  programme.  Self-directed  learning contains  aspects  of  a  self-actualised  learning  programme.  Unlike  SRL, where teachers adopt a more active role, SDL does not rely heavily on modelling and external reinforcement, such as the teacher or other learners (Zimmerman &amp; Schunk 2001).

## Self-directed learning

The theory of SDL was made famous by Knowles (1975) and originated from  the  assumption  that  educational  techniques  for  educating  adults should be completely separate from that for adolescents. However, new research has shown that adolescents can become self-directed (Karatas &amp; Arpaci 2021). Knowles' views are based on the idea that a person's level of maturity as a learner predicts how much they will take charge of their own education. Knowles (1975) characterises SDL as:

[ A ] process in which individuals take the initiative, with or without the help of others, in diagnosing their learning needs, formulating learning goals, identifying human and material resources for learning, choosing and implementing learning strategies, and evaluating learning outcomes. (p. 18)

As a way to individualise and personalise what would otherwise be a standard educational system, Knowles  (1975) promoted  flexibility, choice and independence for learners and fostered various forms of learner assistance (tutoring, counselling and advice). For SDL to work, it must be assumed that intrinsic  factors  drive  learners,  for  example,  the  drive  for  self-esteem (particularly in terms of self-worth), the desire to succeed, a sense of growth and fulfilment  in  one's  own  abilities,  and  a  general  curiosity  in  the  world around them (Knowles 1975). In PoP, SDL is taken a step further, shifting learners from more controlled and less autonomous educational situations to more free and unstructured playful learning environments (Blaschke 2012; Garnett &amp; O'Beirne 2013; Karatas &amp; Arpaci 2021; Luckin 2010):

- 1. Therefore, firstly,  in  order  to  improve  SDL, learning might be done in groups.  Social,  methodological,  cognitive  and  practical  components

are among the four definitions of SDL posed by Long and Associates (2000). The psychological component of SDL focuses on the internal processes  that  contribute  to  SDL,  including  the  four  supplemental elements  of  competence,  choice,  control,  confidence,  metacognition, motivation  and  self-regulation.  The  three  defining  features  of  a  selfdirected  learner  are  'independence',  'the  capacity  to  make  choices' and 'the skill to convey the norms and constraints of a learning activity' (Muongmee 2007). When defining SDL, Williamson (2007) agrees with Knowles and identifies the same five broad categories - the ability to recognise the conditions that foster initiative.

- 2.  Secondly,  methods  of  learning  that  may  help  one  become  more independent.
- 3.  Thirdly, the learning tasks in which learners should participate actively to develop their own sense of autonomy in their studies.
- 4.  Fourthly,  using  assessment  to  keep  tabs  on  how  much  learners  are learning.
- 5.  Lastly, considering learners' social abilities.

All of the following, according to Williamson, are necessary before one may become self-directed in their pursuit of knowledge. According to Warburton and Volet (2012), self-directed learners can ask the right questions to steer their learning, as well as learners who can effectively communicate with their  colleagues (Bary &amp; Rees 2006; Williamson 2007). As Merriam and Caffarella (1991) note, self-directed learners commonly seek out individuals with  similar  learning  requirements  to  explain  and  simplify  issues  and exchange ideas, information and resources. Okoro (2011) and Karatas and Arpaci (2021) emphasise the importance of progressive learner ownership of learning in SDL, which is accomplished via discourse and discussions that  challenge  learners  to  think  critically  and  develop  their  capacity  for greater levels of comprehension.

Contextual control, cognitive responsibility and motivation (entry and task) elements all play a role in learning, according to Garrison's SDL model (1997) (see Figure 2.2). Learning is a collaborative progression in which learners adopt accountability for and control over their own cognitive (selfmonitoring) and environmental (self-management) processes in producing and  verifying  meaningful  learning  results.  Taking  a  cognitive  approach, Garrison sees SDL as a collaborative effort in which the learner assumes accountability  for  generating  meaning  while  also  involving  the  input  of others in validating important information (social perspective).

As per Garrison (1997), an important part of effective self-management is managing learning objectives, resources and support. It is in the research on self-regulatory motivation that we find the term's essence (Pintrich &amp; DeGroot 1990). The elements of competence, resources and dependency

are used to establish task management (Garrison 1993). The facilitator's and  the  learner's  talents  and  capabilities  are  measured  by  proficiency. Various supporting and assistance services are accessible to learners in an educational environment. A learner's integrity and freedom of choice are reflected in their interdependence on their institution or subject's standards and norms. The instructor and the learner work together to help the learner manage  their  own  learning  activities.  In  order  to  achieve  excellent educational  results,  the  teacher  must  maintain  an  adequate  dynamic equilibrium of external control (Prawat 1992; Resnick 1991).

Self-monitoring is another SDL component proposed by Garrison (1997). Cognitive  and  metacognitive  functions  such  as  self-awareness  and  the capability of looking within and analysing one's own cognitive processes are  all  addressed  in  this  chapter.  In  this  process,  the  learner  assumes responsibility  for  constructing  their  own  meaning  by  integrating  new concepts and ideas with their prior knowledge (Parkes 2021). Metacognitive perspectives on learning and the capacity to learn reflectively are supported by this method. Reflective learning may be helpful to 'create learners who can  gauge  themselves  in  a  range  of  contexts'  (Candy,  Harri-Augstein  &amp; Thomas 1985). There is a lack of clarity and specificity in internal feedback; therefore,  teachers  can  give  useful  feedback  to  assist  learners  in  selfmonitoring the quality of the learning output. The learner's competency (abilities and methods) and the contexts and epistemological expectations all have a role in how much self-monitoring they do throughout the learning process (Butler &amp; Winne 1995; Garrison 1991).

Finally,  motivation  catalyses  a  person's  desire  to  learn  and  attain  their cognitive  objectives.  Entering  and  task  motivation  are  two  types  of motivating factors (Zheng &amp; Tan 2019). The act of expressing motivation signals a person's willingness to commit to a certain goal and take action. 'Commitment - the joining together of attitudes, sentiments and aims' is one possible interpretation (Halverson &amp; Graham 2019; Thomson 1992). Task motivation refers to a person's ability to concentrate and persevere on a certain task or goal. According to Corno, 'motivational elements […] affect intentions and drive task engagement' (1989, pp. 114-115). Valence and anticipation are thought to have a role in determining entry motivation. Valence is a measure of how much a person values a given educational objective.  People's  wants  (or  values)  and  emotional  states  shape  the valence  of  a  message  (preferences).  Expectancy  is  the  notion  that  a desired  goal  may  be  accomplished  in  a  learning  situation  (Pintrich  &amp; DeGroot 1990). Volition and task control are intertwined in the concept of task motivation. What we call 'volition' in a learning environment is 'the ability to align one's emotional and behavioural preferences to a certain objective' (Kanfer &amp; Ackermann  1989).  Volition is concerned  with maintaining an intentionally high level of effort or diligent performance to influence perseverance and task performance (Pintrich &amp; DeGroot 1990). Garrison's model of SDL is essential to any pedagogically playful activity. Towards the end of the chapter, this model will be incorporated into a new self-directed PoP framework.

## Problem-based learning

Problem-based learning is a teaching method that focuses on developing learners' problem-solving abilities by allowing them to take control of their own education via an SDL approach, which also involves teamwork skills (Moust, Bouhuijs &amp; Schmidt 2021). Learners are given inelegant, disorganised and ill-structured circumstances in which they assume the position of the situation's owner (see ch. 1). Problem-based learning has numerous benefits over conventional lecture-based instruction, including the fact that learners get to see the issue and the solution first-hand. Making learning relevant to reality, encouraging and pushing learners to study, and engaging learners in a way analogous to the real world are only a few benefits (Ali 2019). In addition to problem-solving, PBL promotes the growth of various other abilities  and  qualities.  It  has  been  argued  by  Larsson  (2001),  as  well  as Seibert  (2021),  that  learners  in  PBL  classes  develop  better  social  skills because they have more opportunities to practice using their preferred (or mother-tongue) language in real-world situations. Problem-based learning might  be  difficult  to  implement  in  a  regular  classroom  environment  if learners and teachers cannot grasp the concept of active or meaningful

participation (Ali 2019). Learners who participate in PBL must have an SDL disposition  and  engage  in  active  learning  practices.  It  was  a  radical departure from standard methods of instruction and educational thinking (Seibert 2021).

## Cooperative learning

Small groups of learners collaborating with each other in teams to solve issues,  complete  specific  activities  and  assignments,  or  attain  shared learning objectives are referred to as CL by Johnson, Johnson and Holubec (2013). Using non-competitive interactions among small groups of learners, CL is a learner-centred method of active learning (Bores-García et al. 2021; Sandi-Urena, Cooper &amp; Stevens 2012). As a result, CL gives learners back command of their own education. Johnson et al. (2013) identified any CL environment's five essential features:

- 1. Positive interdependence: Interdependence between group members is said to be positive if it fosters an awareness that no one can achieve personal success until the collective as a whole does (Turgut &amp; Gülşen Turgut 2018).
- 2. Individual accountability: As a result of individual accountability, each group member must be actively engaged in achieving the group's goals and  understand  his  or  her  role  in  the  group's  success  (Mentz,  Van der Walt &amp; Goosen 2008).
- 3. Collaborative skills: When it comes to social and small-group abilities, everyone in the group must be able to utilise their communication and decision-making abilities and their capacity to develop trust, deal with conflict and lead the group to success (Tran 2019).
- 4. Face-to-face  promotive  interaction: If  team  members  work  carefully with each other, they can assist one another and exchange resources (Kövecses-Gősi 2018).
- 5. Group processing: The team would continually examine how they work as a group to enhance their collaboration (Johnson et al. 2013).

Not all PoPs will necessarily allow for the inclusion of CL. However, any kind of playful activity involving groups could be enhanced by including the five elements of CL. This could also potentially include PBL and PoP activities.

## Pedagogy of play strategies

As  mentioned  in  this  chapter,  several  theories  exist  that  can  link  to  or encourage PoP. However, we now need to understand how PoP can be used in a practical sense. Therefore, this section will delineate the various strategies used within PoP. Several of these strategies are also used in the

proceeding chapters of this book. Figure 2.3 displays the various strategies that are linked to PoP.

## Puppetry

In Kröger and Nupponen's (2019) opinion, puppets may be more widely used  in  classrooms  as  teaching  aids.  Puppetry  is  an  early  type  of amusement  used  to  convey  concerns  and  opinions  in  diverse  human communities; puppetry has a long history as a kind of tradition and culture (Brits et al. 2016). When the Latin term 'pupa' was translated into English, it  referred  to  a  little  creature  (Ahlcrona  2012).  People  have  long  been attracted  by  the  concept  that  a  puppet  'lives'  and  has  inspired  their imaginations.  The  actions  that  puppets  participate  in  enable  their communication potential to develop, enabling viewers' (learners') ideas, feelings and connections to be predicated on these activities, according to Ahlcrona (2012).

Other  types  of  puppets,  also  including  hand  puppets,  rod  puppets  and finger puppets, are also available for performers. The educational setting dictates  the  kind  of  puppet  utilised,  such  as  remedial,  rehabilitative  or regular  teaching-learning  purposes.  Teachers  often  use  puppets  in  a puppet theatre to demonstrate attitudes or other possible subjects, such as disability (Kröger &amp; Nupponen 2019). This allows for additional depth to emerge. Composing a puppetry script, acting with the puppet and adding it to a topic may all be considered forms of creative instruction (Kröger &amp; Nupponen 2019; Tzuriel &amp; Remer 2018). Neurodiverse learners may also benefit from puppet-based instruction, as puppets promote concepts such as  self-worth,  emotional  release  and  other  difficulties  (Purcell-Gates  &amp; Smith 2020). It is possible to use puppetry for an extended period of time because  it  appeals  to  a  wide  range  of  applications  and  themes,  as  per Gobec (2012).

The teacher, fulfilling the role of the puppeteer, might give a goal, and the students can discuss it while performing the puppet show (Ahlcrona 2012; Gobec 2012). When a student takes on the role of puppeteer and uses the puppet to participate in a dialogue with a teacher or peer to show knowledge, this is another kind of mediation. Mediated learning experiences, as described by Feuerstein et al. (2006), may be thought of as the normal way students engage in learning and are then managed by an agent (either the teacher as puppeteer or student as puppeteer - using the puppet) to achieve educational objectives or aims. Using more than ten  studies,  Kröger  and  Nupponen  (2019)  analysed  the  literature  on puppets  as  an  instructional  tool  and  found  five  potential  benefits  of puppetry in the classroom, including:

- · increasing communication
- · improving classroom climate
- · fostering creativity
- · fostering an atmosphere that promotes teamwork and cohesiveness
- · shaping the perspectives and actions of students.

The potential benefits are discussed in this section in more detail.

## Improving communication output

Kröger and Nupponen (2019) state that two-way contact between students and  teachers  is  possible.  A  student's  ability  for  introspective  thinking influences both their degree of comprehension of a subject and their success in  fulfilling  a  set  of  learning  objectives;  therefore,  metacognition  and knowledge transfer go hand in hand. Puppets might act as a go-between for the teacher and student when it comes to teaching, talking and making human connections (Ahlcrona 2012; Keogh et al. 2008; Korošec 2012, 2013).

## Fostering a positive classroom environment

There are three aspects to classroom atmosphere, all of which have been identified  by  Evans  et  al.  (2009),  namely  academic,  managerial  and emotional. These three components may be improved by using puppets, increasing learner enthusiasm (Kröger &amp; Nupponen 2019).

## Creating a creative space

According to Brėdikytė (2002), puppetry may stimulate individual creativity because  puppets  challenge  and  allow  learners  to  express  themselves incorrectly. Because of this, learners are forced to come up with their own innovative solutions to problems they face when confronted with a puppet teacher (Ahlcrona 2012).

## Fostering cooperation and group integration

By releasing stress when students are in a position to support the puppet and,  while  doing  so,  relieve  themselves,  puppets  may  help  students integrate  and  participate  in  group  work  (Korošec  2012).  Kröger  and Nupponen  (2019)  and  Remer  and  Tzuriel  (2015)  both  find  that  using puppets in social settings has positive effects.

## Influencing learner attitudes

Puppets appeal to learners of all ages. Whiteland (2016) finds that the use of puppets helps learners to develop new meanings about a subject. As a result of gaining a better grasp of the issue, individuals may have a more favourable outlook on it. As a study of available literature demonstrates, there is little research on how puppetry is used in schools (Keogh &amp; Naylor 2009). In addition, teachers are wary about using puppetry as a means of teaching and learning, among other things (Brits et al. 2016). Figure 2.4 depicts how puppetry is used to mediate the learning process by teachers as puppeteers and, in certain situations, by learners as puppeteers.

In Figure 2.4, when teachers use puppets, learners sense comfort: They are freed of their anxiety around authority, connecting with their classroom context and what is actually explained (Korošec 2012). Learners frequently trust  in  the  puppet,  which  they  enjoy  feeling  and  rubbing  (sensory), resulting  in  comfortable  subject  dialogues  that  allow  teachers  to  fulfil curriculum objectives in a good classroom setting (Korošec 2012). When learners utilise a puppet, they are more likely to express themselves because any mistakes are the fault of the 'puppet as a person' rather than the learner (Ahlcrona  2012).  When  discussing  a  certain  subject  and  asking  these questions to the puppet, the instructor may also uncover mistakes in the

learners'  knowledge, enabling the learner to take notice of these inaccuracies and learn from them.

## Drama and role-play

There are three elements that, when combined, make play tutoring and drama  work  a  successful  teaching  and  learning  approach  (Sherratt  &amp; Peter  2002).  Learners'  pleasant  'feel  good'  component  from  engaging with people and their rising self-awareness as they learn about cultural customs and acceptable reactions to those traditions must be capitalised on as a first step. Neuroscientific studies demonstrating the link between emotional engagement  and improved cognitive performance lend credence to the effectiveness of theatre as a teaching method (Viirret 2018).  Similar  to  daydreaming  and  other  altered  mental  states,  playful behaviour in learners may cause the release of neurochemicals and the opening  of  previously  closed  neural  connections  (Pitruzzella  2022; Sherratt  &amp;  Peter  2002).  Therefore,  consistent  exposure  to  drama  may lead to the development of more flexible thought patterns in the brain. Mirror neurons, which are recognised to be asymmetrical in autism, will likewise be stimulated by dramatic involvement (Ramachandran &amp; Lindsey 2006). After experiencing something, our 'gut reaction' is aroused, which prompts  us  to  rationalise  our  emotional  response  and  put  it  into  an

acceptable narrative course (Zeng 2019). As a result, learners would have a more cohesive and relevant educational experience if the environment included components that were meaningful to them personally (such as a favourite toy or colour, which might be included in props or costumes).

Other significant dynamics, both of which are tied in particular to the instructor roles, were also highlighted by Kaiafa, Dima and Tsiaras (2020). For  starters,  creating  an  energising  and  enticing  shared  learning  environment is essential - the emotive involvement is seen to be genuine in a setting that is perceived to be authentic while being fictional. It is also important to create conflict between the protagonist's original point of view and a counter-position  (typically  offered  by  the  instructor  in  character)  that keeps the story moving. As with caregivers in early play interactions who inject melodrama, humour, suspense, warmth and excitement into activities, teachers have an emotional significance for attracting learners (Dimnjašević 2020).  Emotionally  enhanced  interactions  promote  direct  knowledge  of another's mental state and a 'theory of mind', which is the basis for invoking intuitive reactions (Peter 2021). Social imagination, the capacity to take on board a depiction of another person's mental processes without necessarily sharing  them,  has  profound  consequences  for  this  development  (Zeng 2019). These characteristics are presented in Figure 2.5.

## Interest

For learners to benefit from the drama sessions, they must be taught at a level suitable for their cognitive abilities, and the subject must be relevant. Real, meaningful things from their everyday lives must be adapted to their

ordinary usage (such as a mug, a fork or a toothbrush) (Pitruzzella 2022). Additionally,  a  drama  lesson  must  aid  the  learners'  growth  in  their representational knowledge by having them work diligently to modify the classroom  setting  to  generate  a  make-believe  world  and  imaginary characters (assisting teachers in character with items of clothing) (Kaiafa et al. 2020). Learners and learners may then be introduced to a different metaphorical  departure:  Familiar  items  (like  a  table)  can  be  utilised  as props and can gain new meanings (like beds) with the aid of blankets and pillows. An important aspect of the group experience is that new meanings may be generated. These nonlinear relationships can be expressed with others, leading to greater interest and motivation. This directly correlates with SDL, as motivation has previously been discussed as one of the pillars of SDL, as outlined by Garrison's (1997) model.

## Affect

Educators require emotional intensity and immediacy to stimulate awareness of an 'other in the meeting of minds' (Pitruzzella 2022), which is the basis for a feeling of 'relatedness' and an early theory of mind (Kaiafa et  al.  2020).  Educators  must give a sense of security by absorbing and reacting to various learners' emotions. Learners benefit from the attitude and dedication of their educators as it triggers their emotional mechanisms that  otherwise  would  be  impotent  or  dormant.  Caregivers  instinctively exaggerate their answers to increase the significance for newborn infants. Their  concentration  must  be  captivated  by  the  conversation  and  not diverted  by  the  surrounding  environment.  However,  the  employment  of aesthetically appealing costume  elements may  make  apparent  the 'another's' pretence and awareness, but they must not be so ornate as to detract from the role's main connotations (Dima &amp; Tsiaras 2021).

## Structure

Learners  may  learn  to  recognise  and  anticipate  in  a  theatre  lesson.  By altering the obstacles for individuals within the well-known storyline, the drama lesson may be an important tool for extending the learners' play (for instance, the variety of hygiene products available for selection and the level of supervision provided by adults). This might lead the group's story in an unexpected direction, or it could be 'tweaked' revealing a previously hidden plot twist (Peter 2021).

## Game-based learning and gamification

Firstly, learner self-efficacy, learner self-determination, motivation, curiosity,  intention,  ability,  goal  and  task  alignment,  self-awareness,

reflection and other conceptions of SRL are all discussed in-depth in Zap and Code's (2009) study of SDL in gaming settings. Features of gaming settings  that  facilitated  SDL  were  investigated,  such  as  an  authentic learning environment, allowing students to practise making choices in a safe, simulated setting. Secondly, students apply what they have learnt in a  realistic  yet  simulated  environment.  Thirdly,  GBL  allows  students  to learn via observation and imitation. Fourthly, students have taken on a wide range of roles in the process of discovering and creating new ideas. In the end, there are places where people may work together under the guidance of (virtual) mentors to acquire new skills and expand existing ones. Independent learning techniques from video games were the focus of another research that deviated from the theoretical paradigm utilised. Interviews and the think-aloud technique were also utilised to uncover what aspects of game design contribute most to the success of SDL in gaming contexts.

## Game-based learning factors promoting self-directed learning

This section provides some significant variables that game designers and educators might consider while building games to encourage SDL in video games in instructional settings based on the research of the user's context (Toh  2018)  (see  Figure  2.6).  These  factors  comprise  affording  'learning analytics as a metacognitive tool', 'gradual release of new information over time', 'a safe space', 'defamiliarisation mechanics' and 'scaffolded learning'.

Figure  2.6  outlines  a  self-directed  PoP  framework  developed  by  the author.

## Learning analytics as a metacognitive tool

Learning analytics may promote SDL and education for the 21st century by enabling learners to monitor their behaviour, decisions and performance  by  visualising  trends  and  offering  quick  feedback  via computer or mobile platforms (Aldowah, Al-Samarraie &amp; Fauzy 2019). However, this is not always the case when the learning analytics data are presented  to  users  and  mostly  operated  at  the  back  end.  Including learner analysis and data visualisation in a game or class environment can  help  learners  evaluate  their  gameplay  activities  or  the  learning procedure  and  enable  learners  to  evaluate  their  performances  and learning compared with other learners' baselines.

## Gradual release of new information over time

New knowledge may be developed in educational games and delivered progressively,  'just-in-time',  to  enhance  SDL  (Gee  2005)  as  a  learner progresses  throughout  the  game  or  classes.  Most  games  merely  offer players a lesson in fundamental movement and environmental interaction. Only after the prologue or introduction of the game was more sophisticated information provided, such as how to progress.

## A place where people may test out new ideas without fear of repercussions

Research on GBL suggests that students may be more willing to experiment with new methods of approaching a problem or a challenging topic without worrying about how their efforts will be evaluated. This is paramount for their future success in the real world (Toh 2018). Low-stakes assessments that  do  not  count  toward  the  final  grade,  prerequisites  grading  and assessment for learning are all examples of methods that may be used to do a formative evaluation of student progress (Heritage 2018). The data gathered  from  educational  video  games  might  be  used  as  a  type  of formative (formal) assessment by teachers.

## Defamiliarisation mechanics

Self-directed  learning  approaches,  for  example,  reflection  and  improvisation, may flourish when students see a situation as fresh and, therefore, more likely to  react  creatively  (Watkins  &amp;  Marsick  1992).  Defamiliarisation mechanics  are  a  kind  of  design  and  implementation  in  video  or  tactile games  that  are  used  for  instructional  reasons  by  making  some  game mechanisms  nonroutine  compared  to  those  employed  in  the  game's beginning (Mitchell 2018). Because of this, defamiliarisation mechanisms

may be employed to encourage learners to create metacognitive techniques for learning how to forget and relearn. Rather than teaching students model solutions that they are unlikely to utilise in the real world, research suggests that instructors might adopt different approaches to defamiliarise learners, such as having learners solve problems in multiple situations, to increase their learning. In GBL, tasks can be tailored to the learner's ZPD throughout gameplay (Verma et al. 2019), and stealth assessment can be used so that testing is practically undetectable (Verma et al. 2019).

## Scaffolded learning: An in-game companion

Scaffolded education is beneficial because it helps students progress and allows  for  material  mastery.  By  building  on  the  learner's  existing  understanding, scaffolding puts into reality Vygotsky's (1987) concept of performing tasks in the ZPD (Wells 1999). Educational scaffolding is based on three pillars. To begin, co-constructing information in a conversational setting is essential for understanding speech. Secondly, it is crucial to consider the nature of the behaviour  in  which  knowledge  (creation)  becomes  ingrained.  Finally, artefacts play a critical function in creating original knowledge (Wells 1999). Educational game designers may begin implementing and incorporating a companion  or  in-game  humanoid  character  to  motivate  the  learner's (scaffolded) SDL in digital, computer-media contexts in light of the foregoing assumptions and previous studies examining the role of a learning companion in  increasing  social  relationships  with  learners  and  motivating  learning (Michaelis &amp; Mutlu 2018). Users might gain experience making difficult moral decisions with the help of an in-game aide.

## LEGO®

The toy company LEGO® was started in 1932 by Ole Kirk Kristiansen as leg godt , who defined it as 'play well', and subsequently, the LEGO® Group has prospered  as  a  family-owned  business.  After  its  introduction  in  1958, LEGO®'s  brick-shaped  toy  blocks  went  on  to  inspire  a  broad  range  of themed sets and play options (Mortensen 2012).

By adhering to the highest levels of testing, the LEGO® Group ensures that its products meet the highest quality standards and demonstrate the greatest  level  of  responsibility  to  its  stakeholders  by  promoting  an environment that fosters creativity and innovation (Jensen, Seager &amp; CookDavis 2018). Random testing throughout the manufacturing process and customer  input  are  all  approaches  through  which  quality  assurance  is carried out in research and development (R&amp;D) (Zosh et al. 2017).

The  corporate  responsibility  standards  (CRS)  of  the  LEGO®  Group reflect  deeply  ingrained  ethical  beliefs  in  the  company's  corporate

structure (LEGO® Group Progress Report 2012). For instance, LEGO® Six BRICKS educational initiative may be used with sets from any period or set type, and they can be used to build anything, making them suitable for the company's concept of 'sustainable play' (LEGO® Group Progress Report 2012):

I  think that by putting our goods in the hands of youngsters, we may have a tremendous  effect  on  the  future  […]  The  physical  interaction  with  our  toys encourages  [ their ] imagination,  creativity,  and  learning,  and  aids  in  their development as tomorrow's builders. Our activities must be safe for our workers and partners, as well as as clean and gratifying for the local communities [ that we serve ]. (p. 23)

Avcı and Şahin (2019), Çankaya, Durak and Yünkül (2017), and Kalelioğlu (2017) all present strong evidence that educational gaming applications built  with  LEGO®  Duplo®  bricks  increase  students'  problem-solving  and reflective-thinking  abilities  (2015).  To  provide  one  example,  Kalelioğlu (2015) conducted an experiment with elementary school students using the Code.org coding platform and found that their ability to think critically and solve problems improved. An increase in efficiency and improvement in  creative  problem-solving abilities  were  discovered  by  Çankaya,  Durak and Yünkül (2017) in Grades 6 and 7 learners who received robotics-based coding instruction.

## Educational robotics

Robots' capacity to aid in children's education is now widely acknowledged, and  their  use  in  educational  settings  is  rising.  They  support  technical courses  like programming  and  non-technical  ones  such  as  science, technology,  engineering  and  mathematics  (STEM)  (Zhong  et  al.  2022). They may even be used to aid in telling stories (Stork 2020) and other creative endeavours.

In  recent  decades,  much  study  has  focused  on  the  importance  of experience  as  an  integral  component  of  learning  (Morris  2020).  This success with robots in education is a direct outcome of that work. According to Piaget (2003) and situated cognition academics, 'to know is to relate', and 'knowledge is not a commodity to be communicated'. Instead of being taught, children 'actively develop their own mental framework', which they do through gaining experience and interacting with objects. As a result, the learning process was transformed by the act of programming. Rather than imposing information on them, this exercise encourages learners to take a more active and self-directed role in learning.

As part of these research studies, play and artefacts were also pushed to the forefront of the discussion on education as a fundamental facet of human  learning.  Playing  is  an  excellent  way  for  youngsters  to  develop

habits that will help them grow intellectually. In the process of assimilation, which Piaget refers to as play's unique purpose, toddlers learn to interact with  new  objects  and  circumstances  by  remembering  previously  learnt schemas, or building blocks, of intelligent behaviour (Morris 2020). There are several ways in which the individual's ability to gain knowledge may be expanded, including toys, everyday items and the surrounding environment. A pendulum, for example, may become an 'object-to-think-with' via play, regardless of whether it is a computer or a robot (Morris 2020).

The  LEGO®  MINDSTORMS®  EV3  Home  application,  designed  by  the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's (MIT) Media Lab and licensed by the LEGO® Group, is the most widely used example of robotics used for educational  purposes  (Afari  &amp;  Khine  2017).  The  MINDSTORMS®  Robotic Invention  System  was  introduced  by  LEGO®  in  1998  and  consisted  of programmable bricks, sensors, actuators and LEGO® Technic parts. The MIT Media Lab projects and research in the 1990s led to this product, including the annual LEGO® Robot Design Competition and the Programmable Brick project in particular (Johal 2020). The LEGO® MINDSTORMS® EV3 Home application is now widely available and being utilised in various scenarios, with an increasing number of educators turning to it for hands-on learning activities. Thymio (Mondada et al. 2017) and Cubetto (Anzoategui, Pereira &amp; Jarrín 2017) are only two of the many computational thinking-teaching robots now on the market.

Playful learning using robots built to display social behaviours, rather than assembly kits, was investigated in less systematic and long-term experiments. It is common for educational programmes to use social robots in the form of teachers or caregivers (Papadopoulos, Sgorbissa &amp; Koulouglioti 2018). But some  studies  have  shown  that  children's  interest  and  learning  may  be improved by having a robot as a friend. When Tanaka and Matsuzoe (2012) introduced the notion of the care-receiving robot, they demonstrated how children  might  improve  their  learning  outcomes  by  instructing  the  robot. Short et al. (2014) also make the case for youngsters serving as teachers. Using DragonBot (also developed by MIT), the authors demonstrate how to use a practical toolbox for creating social robots. Rather, in other research, the robot was used as a mediator. Children with learning impediments can now play in a variety of ways thanks to a robot companion built by Marti and Iacono (2011). Rather, Kronreif et al. (2005) developed a Cartesian coordinate robot which allows learners with significant body limitations to engage with common toys, such as blocks or bricks.

According to Ortiz-Colon and Romo (2016) and McGill (2012), learners' attitudes are favourably influenced by robotic applications. LEGO® MINDSTORMS®  robotics  education  kit  garnered  learners'  attention  and boosted their enthusiasm for related reading (McGill 2012). Furthermore, according  to  Ortiz-Colon  and  Romo  (2016),  LEGO®-based  applications

boost  learner  interest  in  academics.  It  was  found  that  learners  actively engaged  in  robot-related  activities  and  that  these  activities  effectively encouraged them. According to research, learners were shown to be more engaged and motivated while participating in robotics activities (Alimisis 2013). Motivation for the session may positively impact learners' ability to learn  to  code.  Learners'  future  professional  growth  may  be  aided  by robotics-based apps, which pique their interest and keep them engaged. According to other findings, the academic motivation of kids in the Scratch group did not grow more than that of learners in the LEGO®   group. For research  applications  in  general,  the  attitude  and  desire  of  learners  to participate may significantly impact outcomes. Learners' academic motivations might also be affected by the length of the processes and the number of applications  (McGill  2012).  Conversely,  learners'  desire  to  do well in class may be diminished if they are not given credit for their efforts. Study  after  study  shows  a  correlation  between  academic  desire  and  a learner's success score (Broussard &amp; Garrison 2004; Pelch 2018).

Figure  2.7  outlines  a  self-directed  PoP  framework  developed  by  the author. In it, the outer circle has five different PoPs that encircle the rest of the  framework.  These  actual  pedagogies  comprise  puppetry  or  avatars, drama and role-playing, GBL, gamification, LEGO® and robotics. Each of these  pedagogies  must  incorporate  the  three  characteristics  of  playful learning: choice, wonder and delight. If either of these elements is missing, then the activity cannot be considered a PoP. Within the inner part of the framework lies the core SDL component, which is adapted from Garrison's (1997) model.

Instead of separating the three elements of motivation, selfmanagement and self-monitoring, the three SDL components overlap in a PoP framework, as seen in the Venn diagram at the framework's core. Where  these  intersections  occur,  certain  meta-characteristics  can  be observed  and  measured.  For  example,  between  motivation  and  selfmanagement, meta-behaviours such as trial  and  error , observation and modelling , and reinforcement  learning can  be  observed  (Williamson 2015). The motivation level, which closely links to the playful characteristics, will ensure that learners are motivated enough to want to take part in the activity  in  the  first  place.  Motivation  will  be  assured  if  the  learners  are given  autonomy  and  the  activity  allows  for  curiosity  and  enjoyment (Knittle et al. 2020).

In  terms  of  self-management,  the  PoP  will  need  to  allow  learners  to exhibit some form of behavioural management and self-control. Learners could be expected to compete with one another or work in groups, which could lead to clashing ideas or personalities (Hagger et al. 2019). The metabehaviours discussed prior could also assist in seeing how far learners are

regulating their control over their learning. Between self-management and self-monitoring,  certain  metacognitive  functions  can  be  observed  and measured. These include connected learning (Quigley et al. 2020), reflecting and  improvising (Chang  2019), logical  and  analytical  reasoning (Cullen et al. 2018), inquiry-based learning (Khalaf et al. 2018) and synthesis (Saido et al.  2018). These fall on a spectrum, similar to Bloom's taxonomy (see Ruhl, Hughes &amp; Schloss 1987). Some exemplify lower-order thinking skills (LoTS), while others are higher-order thinking skills (HoTS). Whether the PoP is structured in a self-directed manner will ultimately dictate at what level these metacognitive functions will emanate.

In terms of self-monitoring, the learners engaged in the PoP must monitor their active participation and behaviour. This could result in learners getting too excited, for instance, where they will need to regulate their behaviour. Another example would be when a learner loses in a competition and has to subsequently monitor their emotions and motivation level to not distance themselves in terms of participation (Rivera-Pérez et al. 2021). Between self-monitoring and motivation, several meta-emotions could be observed and  measured.  The  emotions  of  learners  will  ultimately  dictate  how motivated they are. It is incorrect to assume that a PoP will always lead to motivated learners (Kaimara &amp; Deliyannis 2019). Depending on how the activities are structured, certain instances can lead to negative emotional states  that  could  dampen  the  spirits  of  learners.  Some  of  these  metaemotions include dissatisfaction, anger, curiosity and satisfaction (Rao &amp; Gibson 2019).

## Conclusion

This chapter aimed to outline the theoretical foundation of PoP and several PoP strategies that could contribute to the development of SDL. Therefore, a newly proposed framework for self-directed PoP balances the requirement for playfulness and self-direction. Future research will either reinforce or refute the conceptual links made in this proposed model. Potential novel findings  may  emerge  that  could  change  this  model.  Each  is  equally important, and each could be measured. If one aspect, such as the playful element, is favoured, it may throw out the balance entirely, sacrificing the self-directed element or vice versa. Therefore, it is important to consider each aspect carefully to maintain the balance.

## Abstract

This  chapter  explores  interactive  pedagogies  of  play  (PoPs)  through  the theory and practice of metaliteracy. As a holistic pedagogical framework for developing  reflective  and  self-directed  learners  in  collaborative  social environments, metaliteracy supports individuals to become active knowledge producers.  The  structure  of  the  metaliteracy  model  includes  interrelated roles, domains and characteristics that reinforce the scaffolding of play- and

problem-based learning in multimodal contexts. The core components of metaliteracy are applied in practice through a set of flexible and adaptable goals and  learning objectives. Through  this analysis of metaliteracy concerning PoPs, we will describe interactive meaning-making in pedagogical situations  involving  collaborative  problem-based  learning  (PBL)  in  four courses at both foundational and advanced levels of the college experience.

## Introduction

This  chapter  explores  connections  between  PoPs  and  the  metaliteracy framework. Metaliteracy emphasises  the reflective and self-directed individual  through  four  learning  domains,  multiple  learner  roles  and characteristics  and  adaptable  goals  and  learning  objectives  (Mackey  &amp; Jacobson 2022). These core components of metaliteracy offer opportunities to highlight problem-based PoPs as mechanisms of self-directed learning (SDL)  and  the  impetus  for  collaborative  engagement  in  dynamic  and multimodal learning communities. For instance, this approach involves the affective learning domain and asks students to reflect upon their emotions to understand why cognitive learning occurred. As a holistic model, the interplay amongst the different components is ongoing and iterative.

Similarly,  play-based  learning  and  PBL  opportunities  emphasise  the interrelated metaliterate learner roles and characteristics. The teacher role supports multiple characteristics: being informed, open, collaborative and civic-minded. The importance of the learner as a producer in metaliteracy provides ample scope to integrate learning opportunities based on realworld  situations  and  play-based  scenarios  that  help  students  develop growth and SDL strategies.

Metaliteracy is reinforced in practice through four primary goals that include:

- 1. actively evaluating content while also evaluating one's own biases
- 2.  engaging with all intellectual property (IP) ethically and responsibly
- 3.  producing  and  sharing  information  in  collaborative  and  participatory environments
- 4.  developing learning strategies to meet lifelong personal and professional goals (Jacobson et al. 2018).

In addition, these primary goals are supported by a set of related learning objectives. This chapter will explore the last two goals related to creating and sharing information and developing individual strategies for lifelong learning  through  metaliteracy.  This  analysis  sets  the  stage  for  future research to examine the application of additional metaliteracy goals and learning  objectives  in  play-based  learning  environments.  For  instance,

the  process  of  meaning-making that emerges through PoP necessitates further study into the evaluation of content and ethical engagement with IP reinforced in the first two goals.

Following the conceptual exploration of the relationships among PoP, SDL,  PBL,  multimodality  and  metaliteracy,  we  examine multimodal PoP where these connections are evident: A locked-box challenge, collaborative digital  whiteboard  creation,  digital  storytelling  production  and  digital media creation in the digital arts. These examples are adaptable to multiple disciplinary  settings  and  varying  student  levels.  Metaliteracy  provides  a framework  for  situating  educational  play  through  PBL  activities  that enhance SDL and PoP.

## Creative pedagogy of play

Nilsson explores the concept of 'creative pedagogy of play' by analysing the work of Swedish scholar Gunilla Lindqvist who was influenced by Lev Vygotsky's theories of play (2009, pp. 14-22). According to Nilsson (2009, p.  14),  'creative  pedagogy  of  play  is  an  educational  approach,  which advocates the joint participation  of  children  and  adults  in  a  collectively created  and  shared  world  of  fiction  -  a  playworld'.  In  this  context,  the playworld is collaboratively designed among the adult and child participants as an imaginative and creative activity to make meaning (Nilsson 2009, p.  16).  Nilsson  (2009,  p.  17)  argues  that  Lindqvist  builds  on  Vygotsky's approach to play by exploring it as a 'comprehensive cultural theory of play'  through  the  arts  based  on  social  interactions  among  adults  and children to create meaning. Nilsson (2009, p. 16) emphasises the association between thought and action by suggesting that 'play creates a fictitious situation in which actions are carried out'. From Nilsson's perspective, play is an imaginative activity for meaning-making (Nilsson 2009).

Lindqvist's  analysis of play  through  dance  education  focuses  on developing meaning through dialogue and imagination (2001, pp. 41-52). She  argues  that  'play  is  imagination  in  action',  which  defines  a  critical relationship  between  one's  creative  thinking  and  behaviour  (Lindqvist 2001, p. 50). According to Lindqvist (2001):

Play creates meaning. The significance of play lies in its meaning, which reflects reality at a deeper level, and should not be interpreted as a realistic presentation of a certain action. Since the child has the capacity to create an imaginary or fictitious situation, this also favours abstract thinking. (p. 50)

From  Lindqvist's  point  of  view,  the  terms  'aesthetics  and  rationality, imagination  and  reality'  are  not  opposing  concepts  but  rather  linked together in meaning (Lindqvist 2001, p. 50). In addition, 'physical action and emotional reaction co-operate' because 'emotion and bodily expression

are connected' (Lindqvist 2001, p. 46). Play supports higher-level abstract thought  processes  through  the  interplay  of  imagination  and  creativity (Lindqvist  2001,  p.  50).  Lindqvist  (2001,  p.  50)  observes  that  in  dance, 'thought and imagination come into being through the expressive acts of the body in play', which she sees as a process of simultaneous activities that include thought, imagination and action. This holistic approach to play inspires  Nilsson's  assertion  that  Lindqvist  (2009,  p.  21)  is  seeking  'a connection  between  play  and  culture  where  artistic  forms  such  as movement,  sound,  and  drama  are  natural  and  original  components'. Considering  the  wide  range  of  elements  described,  the  pedagogical application  of  PoP  and  playworlds  offers  the  potential  for  developing higher-level abstract thinking through the arts, from dance and drama to fiction and digital media.

The foundation for Lindqvist 2001's interpretation of play as a form of meaning-making is grounded in the work of Vygotsky, who argues that play  is essential to learning  because  it  'contains  all developmental tendencies in a condensed form and is itself a major source of development' (Vygotsky &amp; Cole 1978, p. 102). Vygotsky relates this definition of play to one  of  his  pivotal  theories,  the  'zone  of  proximal  development' (ZPD), which he describes as (Vygotsky &amp; Cole 1978):

- […]  the  distance  between  the  actual  development  level  as  determined  by independent  problem-solving  and  the  level  of  potential  development  as determined through problem-solving under adult guidance or in collaboration with more capable peers. (p. 86)

This concept forms the basis of the scaffolding of learning through dialogue with  teachers  and  peers  who  support  self-directed  learners  in  meeting their learning goals and objectives. Wood, Bruner and Ross (1976, p. 90) argue for scaffolding as a social process 'that enables a child or novice to solve a problem, carry out a task or achieve a goal which would be beyond his unassisted efforts'. In the same way that Vygotsky's ZPD goes beyond individual experience, scaffolding reinforces the ability of learners to solve problems in partnership with peers and instructors (Vygotsky &amp; Cole 1978; Wood et al. 1976).

Vygotsky and Cole (1978, p. 103) connects play to higher-level thinking and learning 'from the point of view of development, creating an imaginary situation  can  be  regarded  as  a  means  of  developing  abstract  thought'. Vygotsky  describes  play  within  a  more  extensive  internal  and  external process because 'superficially, play bears little resemblance to the complex, mediated  form  of  thought  and  volition  it  leads  to'  and  'only  a  profound internal analysis makes it possible to determine its course of change and its role in development' (Vygotsky &amp; Cole 1978, p. 104). This assertion suggests that meaning-making through play is informed by more than constructing

imaginary scenarios or worlds because it also requires internalised reflection upon  thoughts  or  actions.  It  is  consistent  with  Nilsson's  (2009,  p.  42) interpretation that 'play is a dynamic meeting between the child's internal activity (emotions and thoughts) and its external activity'.

Malcolm Knowles (1975) defines the self-directed learner as someone responsible for all aspects of their learning, including:

[…]  diagnosing  their  learning  needs,  formulating  learning  goals,  identifying human  and  material  resources  for  learning,  choosing  and  implementing appropriate learning strategies, and evaluating learning outcomes. (p. 18)

Knowles (1975, p. 18) argues that this all-encompassing process takes place when 'individuals take the initiative, with or without the help of others', reinforcing  both  individualised  and  collaborative  learning  with  peers  or teachers. Similar to Vygotsky's ZPD and the related scaffolding process, SDL benefits from opportunities to engage with others in social settings (Vygotsky &amp; Cole 1978; Wood et al. 1976). Garrison (1997, p. 21) argues for a  comprehensive  model  for  SDL  that  involves  'self-management  (task control), self-monitoring (cognitive responsibility), and motivation (entering and task)'. While Garrison's (1997, p. 23) approach focuses on these interrelated components of the individual learner, he also argues for 'a collaborative constructivist view of learning' because 'the individual does not construct meaning in isolation from the shared world'. Garrison (1997) describes  the  relevance  of  this  insight  for  educators  when  designing learning opportunities:

Meaningful  learning  outcomes  would  be  very  difficult  to  achieve  if  students were  not  self-directed  in  their  learning.  Taking  responsibility  to  construct personal meaning is the essence of self-directed learning. At the same time, taking responsibility for one's own learning does not mean making decisions in isolation. The challenge for teachers is to create the educational conditions that will facilitate self-direction. (p. 30)

Through  this  approach,  educators  must  consider  ways  to  foster  selfdirection in collaborative environments for learners to engage with peers and instructors. As part of this process, PBL development reinforces active participation in social contexts.

## Problem-based learning

As  part  of  his  critique  of  the banking  model  of  education ,  Paulo  Freire (2000) argues for an active 'problem-posing education' that is facilitated in dialogue with students, as he states:

[ ]n problem-posing education people develop their power to perceive critically I the way they exist in the world with which and in which they find themselves; they come to see the world not as a static reality, but as a reality in process, in transformation. (p. 83)

Through this transformative approach to education, learners engage with the world and each other to make meaning and create knowledge together. Rather than a passive method of rote memorisation, for instance, individuals are liberated to be active and collaborative in dialogue with teachers and peers  because  'Liberating  education  consists  in  acts  of  cognition,  not transferrals of information' (Freire 2000, p. 79).

In her definition of PBL, Diana Stentoft (2017, p. 55) draws upon the work of Freire and asserts that 'central to PBL is a break from students as passive recipients of knowledge supplied by the expert teacher'. Similar to Freire's concept of problem-posing education ,  Stentoft  (2017,  p.  55) argues  that  'students  learn  through  their  active  engagement  with meaningful activities drawing on their own prior experiences, and thus, they  create  their  own  learning  processes'.  Stentoft  (2017,  pp.  54-55) summarises  several  key  components  that  define  PBL,  including active , student-centred and self-directed learning  that  applies constructivist principles in  support of critical thinking to  solve complex real-life problems . As  with  SDL  and  problem-posing  education,  PBL  is  an  individual  and collaborative process built on group work and communication competencies (Stentoft  2017,  p.  55).  Problem-based  learning  involves interrelated  dimensions  of  learning  because  it  'assists  learners  in  their development of cognitive as well as metacognitive skills through emphasis on  not  only  the  academic  product  but  also  the  academic  (learning) process' (Stentoft 2017, p. 55).

## Multimodality

Similar to how PoP is defined as a process of constructing meaning, the concept of multimodality is also linked to meaning-making. Kress (2010, p. 27) says that multimodality is 'a social semiotic theory of communication' that involves a process of production and participation in which 'knowledge is always produced rather than acquired'. The author (Kress 2011, p. 242) describes  an  interdisciplinary  approach  to  multimodality  that  combines ethnography  and  social  semiotics  because  it  'names  a  field  of  work,  a domain for enquiry, a description of the space and the resources which enter into meaning, in some way or another'. Kress (2011, p. 255) says that 'multimodality includes all modes as socially shaped resources for making meaning: Action, movement; three-dimensional objects, such as instruments, tools, sculptures; space, socially shaped'. Olivier (ed. 2020) introduces 'self-directed multimodal learning' as:

[ A ]n approach to education where individual modal preferences, communication through different modalities, as well as the blending of learning, teaching and delivery by means of different modes are employed with the aim of fostering self-directedness among students (p. xxxiv)

In support of this methodology, Olivier (ed. 2020, p. 4) argues that 'selfdirected multimodal learning is informed by social semiotic theory as the foundational  framework'  and  that,  ultimately,  'multimodal  learning  is about making meaning'. From Olivier's (ed. 2020, p. 9) perspective, selfdirected  multimodal  learning  is  transformative  and  facilitated  through open education while being an objective for learners to strive towards. He (ed. Olivier 2020, p. 9) says that 'SDL is regarded as both a process and a learning aim, and multimodality is the vehicle and environment'. Ultimately, Olivier (ed. 2020, p. 15) presents a visual model for the four main 'levels of multimodality within multimodal learning' that encompass individual , interactional  instructional , and institutional multimodality . He investigates each of these levels as separate components that are also interrelated within  this  comprehensive  model  of  multimodality  (ed.  Olivier  2020, pp. 15-31).

The concept of multimodality is relevant to exploring PoPs because it involves  meaning-making  and  SDL.  In  addition,  the  literature  about PoP identifies a wide range of meaning-making modes that impact the learning experience and support learners as knowledge producers. For instance,  as  we  have  seen,  Lindqvist  (2001,  p.  43)  emphasises  the importance of meaning in her analysis of play and dance by arguing that 'world, action and characters are interconnected in play, and the children create meaning, which provides a base both for abstract thinking and artistic, creative ability'. This relationship between  play and the construction  of  meaning  is  grounded  in  the  work  of  Vygotsky  (1978, p.  104),  who  says  that  'it  is  the  essence  of  play  that  a  new  relation is  created between the field of meaning and the visual field - that is, between situations in thought and real situations'. Lindqvist's work is focused primarily  on  the  application  of  play  in  the  world  of  the  arts, which offers the potential for many different modes. The development of meaning in these contexts involves the interplay of imagination and real-world scenarios in multiple modalities.

The  PoP  literature  includes  further  examples  of  research  related  to different modes of play that are wide-ranging and include such approaches as the use of play-based card and board games to  teach early mathematical concepts in kindergarten or pre-primary school (early childhood education [ECE]) (Vogt et al. 2018). In this study, the researchers conclude that 'the educators were more enthusiastic about a play-based approach' and that 'their  positive  attitude  might  have  been  a  contributing  factor  to  the learning success of the children found in this study' (Vogt et al. 2018, p. 599).  Another  example  of  PBL  includes  implementing  'a  Conceptual PlayWorld  where  children  and  educator  collectively  dramatised  the concept of growth and the butterflies' lifecycle' (Li 2022, p. 285). Li (2022,

p. 290) argues that through this interactive modality involving both verbal and nonverbal communication, 'the key to developing powerful collective play  environments  to  strengthen  children's  conceptual  thinking  is  the educators' affective engagement in this important process'.

The  literature  also  investigates  challenges  related  to  integrating digital technology into PoPs activities. Edwards (2013, p. 208) argues that while 'play might well be understood as how children make meaning and learn about their worlds', it is often separated from the PoP in early childhood  education  (ECE).  Edwards  (2013,  p.  208)  argues  for  a 'consumption-as-social-participation' approach 'to highlight the extent to which the evolving nature of the cultural context creates conditions that manifest the need for potentially different iterations of what might be considered 'play'. In this reimagined context, 'online virtual play with avatars becomes a necessary support to early digital literacy' (Edwards 2013, p. 208). In another example, Palaiologou (2016) conducted a study among teachers in five different countries to investigate why teachers are reluctant to incorporate digital technologies in play-based pedagogy. This finding indicates that while the teachers surveyed are comfortable using digital devices in their everyday lives, they do not apply it in their pedagogy  related  to  play-based  activities  (Palaiologou  2016).  The author  concluded  that  'three  key  dispositions  can  be  identified  functional, emotional and cognitive - that might hinder the integration of  digital  devices'  into  their  instructional  practices  (Palaiologou  2016, p. 316).

Through this exploration of PoPs, meaning-making emerges as a central theme (Lindqvist 2001; Nilsson 2009). These ideas are grounded in the work  of  Vygotsky  (Vygotsky  &amp;  Cole  1981)  and  encompass  pedagogical theories  related  to  SDL  (Garrison  1997;  Knowles  1975)  and  PBL  (Freire 2000; Stentoft 2017). Multimodality is another key consideration because PoP involves the extent to which a wide range of different modes, from the arts  to  games,  to  digital  technologies,  are  incorporated  into  play-based activities  (Edwards  2013;  Kress  2010,  2011;  Li  2022;  Lindqvist  2001;  ed. Olivier 2020; Palaiologou 2016; Vogt et al. 2018).

Several  of  these  theoretical  intersections  relate  to  metaliteracy  as  a comprehensive pedagogical framework and have been applied in practice (Mackey &amp; Jacobson 2022). While these associated concepts have been discussed concerning metaliteracy previously (Jacobson, Mackey &amp; Olivier 2021; Mackey &amp; Jacobson 2022), PoP as a theoretical and applied construct has  not  been  thoroughly  analysed  in  relation  to  this  model.  Given  the conceptual linkages among these core pedagogical principles, a deeper exploration of these ideas is needed to envision the practical design of interactive PoPs through the lens of metaliteracy.

## Metaliteracy

As  first introduced,  metaliteracy  was  proposed  as  a reframing and redefinition of  information  literacy  to  prepare  learners  for  social  media environments and online communities (Jacobson &amp; Mackey 2013; Mackey &amp; Jacobson 2011). Over time, metaliteracy evolved into a flexible and holistic framework  for  a  wide  range  of  disciplinary  settings  and  pedagogical situations (Mackey &amp; Jacobson 2022). Metaliteracy involves the effective and responsible production of information in multiple modes, from digital stories to diverse collaborative projects and digital presentations (Mackey &amp; Jacobson 2022, p. 1).

The development of metaliterate learners as producers in such disparate learning  situations  includes  a  central  focus  on  self-awareness  through metacognition (Mackey &amp; Jacobson 2014, 2022). According to Flavell (1979, p. 908), individuals are continuously placed in situations that will 'provide many opportunities for thoughts and feelings about your own thinking to arise  and,  in  many  cases,  call  for  the  kind  of  quality  control  that  metacognitive experiences  can  help  supply'.  Flavell  suggests  an  ongoing  process  of metacognitive reflection for individuals to gain insights about their thinking while also self-regulating or taking charge of their learning (Flavell 1979).

From  a  metaliteracy  perspective,  self-awareness  about  oneself  as  a metaliterate  learner  supports  individuals  in  gaining  more  than  discrete skills because they gain a better understanding of who they are as learners. As  part  of  this  process,  they  strive  toward  a metaliteracy  mindset that prepares  them  for  wide-ranging  learning  situations  and  environments (Mackey  &amp;  Jacobson  2022,  pp.  20-21).  Reflection  is  important  to  this approach because 'a metaliteracy mindset is realised through metacognition and the self-awareness of being an active learner who plays multiple roles to effectively participate in shared communities' (Mackey &amp; Jacobson 2022, p. 20). Individuals gain new insights about who they are as learners as they work  toward  being  fully  engaged  in  their  ongoing  development.  This process involves scaffolding learning through interactions with peers and teachers in social settings (Mackey &amp; Jacobson 2022, p. 43).

Metaliteracy is designed as a flexible, open and integrated model (see Figure 3.1) involving three interrelated spheres of learning - domains, roles and characteristics - that are reinforced through an adaptable set of goals and learning objectives. The centre sphere of this model shows the four learning  domains,  including  the affective , behavioural , cognitive and metacognitive (Mackey &amp; Jacobson 2022, pp. 23-30). The distinct aspect of each domain and the interrelated nature of these dimensions supports individuals in understanding their learning process better. The outer sphere of  the  model  identifies  specific  metaliterate  learner  roles,  including  the

producer , which inspired this approach, along with related responsibilities, such  as  the researcher , publisher , translator and teacher (Mackey  &amp; Jacobson 2022, pp. 32-34). The sphere between the domains and roles defines  the  metaliterate  learner  characteristics  they  strive  to  gain  in learning activities. These metaliterate learner qualities or attributes include being productive, collaborative, informative and participatory, emphasising the  social  dimension  of  producing  reliable  information  (Mackey  2019, pp. 16-23; Mackey &amp; Jacobson 2022, pp. 30-32). Additional characteristics involve  striving  to  be  reflective,  open,  adaptable  and  civic-minded, acknowledging  several  key  internal  qualities  and  the  responsibilities  to one's community.

Metaliteracy is discussed in relation to Malcolm Knowles's definition of SDL  and  Paulo  Freire's  concept  of  problem-posing  education  closely associated  with  PBL  (Freire  2000;  Jacobson  et  al.  2021;  Knowles  1975; Mackey &amp; Jacobson 2022; Stentoft 2017). The model is examined concerning SDL and assessment by analysing a digital badging activity in an Educational Planning  course  and  a  Wikipedia  editing  assignment  in  a  one-credit information  literacy  course  (Jacobson  et  al.  2021).  As  a  pedagogical framework, metaliteracy combines theories of SDL with metacognition and collaborative  learning  (Flavell  1979;  Knowles  1975).  Metaliterate  learner

roles  that  include  being  a  participant,  collaborator  and  producer  are embedded  in  this  approach  as  individuals  reflect  on  who  they  are  as learners  and  how  they  work  with  others  to  support  their  ongoing development. The metacognitive learning domain is pivotal to this process as  self-directed  learners  reflect  on  their  thinking  in  learning  situations. Additionally, they strive to gain such metaliterate learner characteristics as being reflective, collaborative, participatory and productive as well.

Although the relationship between metaliteracy and PoPs has not been fully investigated, this model is discussed as an impetus for designing a game-based digital badging system based on the metaliteracy goals and learning objectives (O'Brien 2018). The model is also discussed in relation to  multimodality  because  'the  multitude  of  modes  that  are  available  in today's ever-changing social information environment provides teachers and  learners  with  available  resources  to  produce  and  share  knowledge collaboratively' (Mackey &amp; Jacobson 2022, p. 58). Olivier (ed. 2020, p. 18) says  that  metaliteracy  supports  'individual  multimodality'  because  it 'proposes a student-centred aspect where students also act as producers'. The variety of different modes to support the construction of meaning in today's  connected  world  range  from  such  dynamic  forms  as  digital storytelling  to  virtual  worlds  and  maker-space  communities  (Mackey  &amp; Jacobson 2022, pp. 61-66).

Now that the concept of metaliteracy as a pedagogical framework is established,  we  will  explore  relationships  between  the  model's  main components  and  play  pedagogies.  The  intersection  of  theory  will  then inform  the  specific  application  of  this  approach  in  several  metaliteracy learning activities.

## Learning domains

As  noted  earlier,  metaliteracy  emphasises  four  interrelated  domains  of learning: metacognitive, affective, cognitive and behavioural. This comprehensive approach encourages individuals to recognise that it is not solely  the  cognitive  and  behavioural  domains  that  indicate  learning  has taken place. Skills- and recall-based understandings of learning focus on these two domains but omit critical aspects of the process contributed by the metacognitive and affective domains.

All four learning domains have a role in PoP, as will be evident in the examples presented later in this chapter. This section considers the domains and their roles in learning in light of PoPs, with its elements of PBL and implications for SDL. Interwoven are connections with selected metaliteracy goals and learning objectives (Jacobson et al. 2018). All references to the goals and learning objectives below refer to this source.

It is  important  to  recognise  that  experiential  learning  is  an  effective pedagogical approach encompassing all four learning domains. It can be incorporated as a core component of play-based learning and to encourage SDL. Experience can enhance motivation and engagement, provoking 'us with wonder and curiosity' (Gibbons 2002, p. 47).

Kolb's  experiential  learning  model  is  also  pertinent  to  play-based pedagogy.  This  model  moves  from  concrete  experience  to  reflective observation, abstract conceptualisation and active experimentation (Institute of Experiential Learning 2021). Several studies assess the value of integrating  Kolb's  experiential  learning  cycle  in  connection  with  gamebased learning (GBL) (Buur, Schmidt &amp; Barr 2013; Kebritchi, Hirumi &amp; Bai 2010; Thatcher 1990).

Pitt et al. (2015, p. 1013) address the potential impact of living through learning topics and making memories rather than memorisation: 'This type of  learning  is  attainable  in  structured  educational  encounters,  where unique  experiences  are  created  to  trump  traditional  didactics  in  their ability  to  produce  lasting  memories'.  They  argue  that  'well-designed games […] should increase student involvement, motivation, enthusiasm and interest in the material, which can lead to an ideal memory-making environment' (Pitt et al. 2015, p. 1014). The experiential aspects of playand  game-based  pedagogies  will  be  considered  within  the  section  for each domain.

## Affective

Immordino-Yang and Damasio refer to the need to go beyond 'the rational' domain of learning. They support a holistic approach and interplay among the domains, as does metaliteracy (Immordino-Yang &amp; Damasio 2016):

When educators fail to appreciate the importance of students' emotions, they fail to appreciate a critical force in students' learning. One could argue, in fact, that they fail to appreciate the very reason that students learn at all. (p. 40)

Learning is often focused on the cognitive and the behavioural, with these two  domains  at  times  closely  intertwined.  They  also  explore  recent advances  in  the  neuroscience  of  emotions  and  the  impact  that  new understandings that the relationship between learning and emotion may have on pedagogy (Immordino-Yang &amp; Damasio 2016, p. 28). One of the problems associated with 'logical reasoning skills and factual knowledge', they conclude, 'is that this type of knowledge is often not what is needed in actual life' (Immordino-Yang &amp; Damasio 2016, p. 39).

Learning through experience, whether real-life or play-based, encompasses much more than simply the rational (or cognitive) domain, allowing students

to develop multiple intelligences, such as emotional literacy and interpersonal skills  that  transfer  well  to  real-world  situations  (Wingert  &amp;  Molitor  2015). Kolb's experiential learning model addresses being open-minded and flexible in  the  concrete  experience  phase  (The  Training  Thinking  2015),  which connects to the affective learning domain.

This domain plays a key role in PoPs. It impacts motivation (Bawa 2019, p. 381), problem-solving and decision-making (Immordino-Yang &amp; Fischer 2016,  p.  86).  As  these  are  all  important  elements  in  the  design  of  playbased  pedagogy,  it  is  critical  to  recognise  the  importance  of  building affective elements into play-based units and activities.

The conscious inclusion of affective domain-related elements into the learning approaches aligns well with one particular metaliteracy learning objective - Goal 4 aimed at developing learning strategies to meet lifelong personal and professional goals - that highlights SDL. Within the goal are two  pertinent  objectives,  which  encompass  flexibility  and  adaptability, aligning with Kolb's model.

## Goal 4: Adapt to new learning situations while being flexible about varied learning approaches

In traditional formal educational models, students beyond elementary or primary school are not often confronted with play-based learning opportunities and may feel uncomfortable in such situations. Recognising the importance of flexibility and keeping an open mind about the value of such  a  novel  approach  helps  an  individual  recognise  the  potential  for learning in various situations. Closely connected to the flexibility objective is to adapt to and understand new learning situations while being flexible when using varied approaches to learning.

## Goal 4: Adapt to and understand new technologies and the impact they have on learning

The nature of technology is to change, and to be a metaliterate self-directed learner, individuals must recognise that they are capable of mastering new technologies through experience and application. Suppose a selected PoP introduces  learners  to  new  online  applications  and  technologies  and provides them with the tools to succeed. In that case, individuals will foster a stronger sense of confidence in their ability as self-directed learners to adapt to future technologies.

As  we  will  see  in  several  examples  of  courses  that  encourage  the production of information, this objective is both affective and metacognitive. It is central to the development of metaliterate learners.

## Goal 3: See oneself as a producer as well as a consumer of information

Metaliteracy  thus  challenges  individuals  to  engage  with  the  affective domain  in  learning,  as  is  evident  in  its goals and learning  objectives . Nevertheless, it also allows scaffolding student learning when metaliteracy is explicitly included in a course's content. Open pedagogy is discussed in regards to the scaffolding of learning through metaliteracy (Mackey &amp; Jacobson 2022, pp. 85-86), but it would also apply in play-based learning situations.  Both  open  pedagogy  and  PoPs  introduce  a  new  type  of learning  opportunity  for  students,  and  each  has  the  potential  to discomfort students who  understand learning primarily from the cognitive domain. When the educational system prioritises the transfer of information from the instructor to the student via lectures, it can be difficult  for  some  students  to  assume  a  more  proactive  role.  Learning based on familiar models' cognitive aspects trigger an affective impact when disrupted.

## Cognitive

In  adult  play-based  learning  activities,  it  is  vital  to  focus  on  learning objectives. These objectives should address 'specific themes and narrower topics', which will help teachers to develop their activities (Pitt et al. 2015, p. 1014). Ignacio and Chen (2020, p. 5) analysed the impact of web-based classroom gaming amongst nursing students and described game-based learning as 'a micro-level strategy that facilitates meaningful learning at the session level'. They note that gaming is student-centred and has the ability to 'promote the development of 21st-century skills such as critical thinking' (Ignacio &amp; Chen 2020, p. 5). A mixed-methods research study of business students  found  that  they  felt  that  digital  game-based  learning  (DGBL) helped learn course content and study for exams. Exam scores bore this out (Bawa 2019, pp. 379-380).

Pitt et al. (2015) suggest moving beyond student-centred to studentdirected  learning  opportunities.  They  argue  that  'if  student-directed teaching is used correctly, the leader can focus less on teaching facts, and more on facilitating discussion that triggers higher-order cognitive skills such as application and analysis' (Pitt et al. 2015, p. 1016). While not all PBL is student-directed, examples include students developing questions for a 'Jeopardy'-type game. In another example, 'Stump the Class',  groups  of  students  design  a  question  involving  high  levels  of critical  thinking,  which  they  then  pose  to  other  teams  in  the  class (Wingert &amp; Molitor 2015).

In Kolb's model (The Training Thinking 2015), the abstract conceptualisation phase connects to the cognitive domain:

[ L ]earning  involves  using  theories,  logic  and  ideas,  rather  than  feelings,  to understand problems or situations. Typically, the learner relies on systematic planning and develops theories and ideas to solve problems. (n.p.)

According to this model, the affective domain is excised from the abstract conceptualisation phase, though that surgical division may be difficult to apply in practice.

There  are  many  cognitive  metaliteracy  learning  objectives,  and  they appear in all four learning goals. While it depends on the nature of the playbased activity and the problems students are grappling with, the following are likely related to assorted play-based learning situations. The second is closely tied to Kolb's abstract conceptualisation phase.

## Goal 3: Recognise that learners are also teachers and teach what you know or learn in collaborative settings

The nature of the play-based activity will determine whether this objective associated with this goal is pertinent to any given learning situation. Pitt et al. (2015,  p.  11)  promote  the  idea  of  student-directed  teaching,  and instructors developing activities may build in the chance for students to serve as teachers, allowing them to enhance their learning. Whitman (1988, p. iii) cites studies that 'demonstrate that the cognitive processing used to study material to teach is different from studying to take a test' (Bargh &amp; Schul 1980; Benware &amp; Deci 1984), and 'the peer learners benefit because of the ability of peers to teach at the right level' (Schwenk &amp; Whitman 1984).

## Goal 4: Recognise that critical thinking depends upon knowledge of a subject and actively pursue deeper understanding through inquiry and research

While some GBL activities depend upon knowledge of a subject (e.g. a 'Jeopardy'-like  game),  those  activities  might  simply  emphasise  recall. Instead, play- or game-based learning opportunities may be designed to highlight critical thinking to buttress an emphasis on the inquiry process.

## Goal 4: Effectively communicate and collaborate in shared spaces to learn from multiple perspectives

Many play-based activities involve student collaboration (refer to the 'Playinfused activities for first-year students' section as an example). This means

that  communication  among  students,  and  an  openness  to  multiple  perspectives, are vitally important. Students have the opportunity to recognise that these varied approaches and perspectives are beneficial to their learning and their success when a play-based activity is designed accordingly.

Other cognitive objectives will apply in particular cases. As an example, the first-year student case study involves the collaborative creation of an online whiteboard. For that situation, this objective was pertinent: 'Differentiate between copyright, Creative Commons, and open licenses in both the creation and licensing of original and repurposed content (Goal 2)'.

As  we  will  see  in  the  analysis  of  an  upper-level  'Digital  Storytelling' course, this cognitive objective also supports learners in producing original digital narratives.

## Behavioural

Visual and auditory stimuli, mystery, problem-solving, interaction, outcomes and feedback, and elements that evoke curiosity may be considered within PBL  (Woo  2014,  p.  293).  Keeping  these  components  in  mind  helps  to develop appropriate activities in multiple modes.

In Kolb's experiential learning model, the behavioural learning domain would be evident in both the concrete experience phase as well as the active experimentation phase. Kolb stated (The Training Thinking 2015):

[ L ]earning in this stage takes an active form of experimenting with changing situations. The learner would take a practical approach and be concerned with what really works instead of simply watching a situation. (n.p.)

Although on the surface this seems somewhat different from the following metaliteracy learning objectives, it actually encompasses the more focused metaliteracy objectives.

Behavioural objectives relating to PBL are highlighted throughout the goals, as seen here from objectives within Goals 2-4:

- · Responsibly produce and share original information and ethically remix and repurpose openly-licensed content (Goal 2).
- · Share knowledge accurately and effectively through content production using appropriate and evolving formats and platforms (Goal 3).
- · Participate conscientiously and ethically in collaborative environments (Goal 4).

As we will see in several examples of metaliterate learning in the second half  of  this  chapter,  these  goals  and  objectives  play  out  in  multimodal problem-solving activities and the production of individual and collaborative digital media projects.

## Metacognitive

Keller  (1987),  the  creator  of  the  attention,  relevance,  confidence  and satisfaction (ARCS)  motivation  model,  recognises  that  the  time  for reflection  is  not  during  a  play-based  activity  but  rather  serves  a  better purpose when it follows that activity. This accords with Woo (2014, p. 292), that a game or playful approach should stimulate individuals in ways that ensure the full focus is on the activity. Following the learning opportunity is the best time for substantive reflection, which might include both group and individual components. The group discussion highlights a variety of perspectives that might provide additional illumination, and the individual provides an opportunity for considering one's own actions and reactions.

Kolb's (The Training Thinking 2015) reflective observation phase of the learning  cycle  is  metaliteracy's  metacognitive  learning  domain,  with  an element of the affective:

- […] people understand ideas and situations from different points of view. In a learning  situation  the  learner  would  rely  on  patience,  objectivity,  and  careful judgment but would not necessarily take any action. The learner would rely on their own thoughts and feelings in forming opinions […]. (n.p.)

Kolb's  placement  of  this  learning  phase  after  the  concrete  experience phase  follows  Keller's  recommendation  that  reflection  occurs  after  the experience or activity.

Two  objectives  from  Goal  4  -  'develop  learning  strategies  to  meet lifelong  personal and professional goals' - are closely aligned with such post-action reflection:

- · Recognise that learning  is  a  process  and  that  reflecting  on  errors  or mistakes leads to new insights and discoveries (Goal 4).
- · Assess one's learning to determine both the knowledge gained and the gaps in understanding (Goal 4).

While journaling might accomplish this, it could be built into a play-based activity's  concluding  component.  If  the  activity  were  collaborative,  the reflective component might be as well. One way would be to use group reflection cards. Learning that occurred during the play activity might be assessed  immediately  afterwards,  or  be  revisited  later  in  the  course,  or both. In a digital world, these objectives support online self-assessments and peer reviews of media projects produced and published by learners in the same course.

## Learner roles and characteristics

The interrelated  learner  roles  of  the  metaliteracy  model  are  aspirational responsibilities to support the development of active knowledge producers

(Mackey &amp; Jacobson 2014, 2022). The specific roles, such as the researcher, producer, publisher and author, reinforce an individual's ability to contribute to dynamic information environments. The social dimension of these spaces requires  related  roles,  such  as  the  collaborator,  translator,  participant, communicator and teacher. Embedded in the model is the concept that individuals  are  both  learners  and  teachers  because  learning  itself  is  a dialogic  and  social  process  (Freire  2000;  Mackey  &amp;  Jacobson  2022; Vygotsky  &amp;  Cole  1981).  As  part  of  this  holistic  framework,  a  set  of characteristics unifies the model by defining the qualities or attributes that self-directed learners reach toward as a part of learning activities. Several of  the  characteristics  emerge  directly  from  the  learner  roles,  such  as productive (producer), informed (researcher), collaborative (collaborator) and participatory (participant). In addition, related characteristics such as being open, adaptable and civic-minded encourage learners to develop qualities that prepare them for responsible engagement with individuals in contentious or divided information environments (Mackey 2019; Mackey &amp; Jacobson 2022).

The relationship between role-play and PoPs has been explored as an area of interest in research, offering potential synergies with metaliteracy's roles and related characteristics. For instance, Brom et al. (2016, p. 339) examine team-based role-play in DGBL environments and found that 'team role-playing  contributed  to  an  increase  in  positive  affect  and  flow;  and perhaps, in turn, in learning gains'. In a qualitative study, Rogers and Evans (2007) interviewed teachers about their use of role-play in classes with children  only  between  four-  and  five-years-old.  Their  research  suggests that 'role-play is valued highly by both children and adults, and it can make a significant contribution to the development of young children' (Rogers &amp; Evans 2007, p. 154). The authors argue for 'a more critical pedagogy of play'  that  'encourages  children's  participation  in  the  construction  of pedagogical practice' (Rogers &amp; Evans 2007, p. 154).

The idea of a 'critical pedagogy of play' reinforces the metacognitive dimension of metaliteracy to continuously think about one's own thinking in ongoing learning situations to gain new insights about the roles learners play to construct knowledge and make meaning. This finding aligns with the aim of metaliteracy to develop self-directed learners who identify and strive toward active roles as knowledge producers (Knowles 1975; Mackey &amp; Jacobson 2022). It supports Knowles' definition of self-directed learners who are fully engaged in all aspects of their learning and Freire's approach to  problem-posing  education  by  working  in  dialogue  with  peers  and teachers  (Freire  2000;  Knowles  1975).  It  also  supports  Stentoft's  (2017) definition  of  PBL  as  a  process  of  active  knowledge  production.  From  a metaliteracy perspective, learners recognise their roles and strive toward or focus on those that require further development. Similar to the findings

of Rogers and Evans, metaliteracy is about learning in social settings that require active participation from teachers and learners, especially because metaliterate learners play both roles. Providing opportunities for learners to practice metaliterate learner roles in learning activities while developing associated  characteristics  through  'a  critical  pedagogy  of  play'  offers considerable potential to advance dialogue, self-direction and PBL in social settings.

## Applying holistic strategies for multimodal pedagogies of play

When  considering  how  best  to  introduce PoPs  through  a holistic metaliteracy  model  that  involves  PBL  and  SDL,  key  considerations  that apply  to  all  pedagogical  situations  must  be  considered.  Both  identified learning objectives and the need to meet students where they are in their academic  development  are  important  to  consider.  Depending  on  the specific pedagogy to be employed, students' levels of expertise in their major subject may also be an indispensable factor. This section examines strategies that have been applied in both upper and lower-level courses. In these different contexts, lower-level courses are usually introductory and offered in the first two years of study, while upper-level classes are advanced and expand far beyond foundational concepts.

These examples illustrate  not  only  the  holistic  metaliteracy  model  as examined  in  the  metaliteracy  section  but  also  the  ability  of  PoPs  to incorporate the other themes of this book: PBL and SDL. There are two play-infused activities  for  first-year  Bachelor  in  Education  (BEd)  degree students and two for more advanced BEd students. While the play-related components vary from an actual game to the production of multimodal digital media projects, they all encourage students to engage with their learning in ways that allow them to shape either the outcome, in the case of a 'BreakoutEDU' game or what they produce.

## Play-infused activities for first-year students

The first two pedagogical examples were developed for use in a required first-year course, 'Writing and Critical Inquiry (WCI)', taught at the University at  Albany,  State  University  of  New  York  (SUNY)  Empire  State  College, United  States  of  America  (USA).  The  WCI  course  strives  to  encourage students to recognise, practice and develop a lifelong habit of engaging in inquiry and critical thinking (Detwiler, Jacobson &amp; O'Brien 2018, pp. 62-63).

Explored here are class sessions that are the product of a years-long collaboration between the two information literacy librarians and one of

the  WCI  instructors.  Other  course  themes  include  developing  a  growth mindset  and  emphasising  learner  roles  as  participant,  collaborator  and producer. The librarians join the WCI instructor and students for up to four class periods during the semester and participate in developing accompanying  assignments  and  writing  prompts  to  support  student learning in the class sessions.

## Collaboration and problem-solving

The WCI classroom activities, a locked-box adventure and the development of an open online resource that explores a growth mindset, were carefully designed to meet the programme and instructor's goals. The first of these goals focused on developing a growth mindset, the second was to address the  course  theme  of  inquiry,  and  the  third  was  to  help  develop  team cohesiveness (Detwiler et al. 2018, p. 63). These activities were designed so that student groups would learn from one another as they worked through the challenging tasks they were given. The problems were representative of  real-world  issues,  distilled  for  the  setting  of  this  course.  The  inquiry process  and  developing  a  growth  mindset  are  abstract  but  crucial  for lifelong learning and personal growth.

These activities were used in different semesters. They are quite different, but  both  require  students  to  work  collaboratively,  during  which  they develop problem-solving skills in order to be successful.

The WCI instructor learning team was aware that because this class was jointly  taught  in  the  early  part  of  the  semester,  students  were  still acclimatising themselves to many social, academic and personal factors. Both activities were designed to factor in the changes and disequilibrium experienced by the students. They were specifically designed to be used in preparation for the course elements that followed. The students are not just told about the importance and benefits of collaborative learning; they have the opportunity to experience it. This experience is quite intensive in the actual game. In the online whiteboard project, it is present, but to a lesser degree. The course instructor reintroduces key elements from this early  class  session  at  appropriate  points  during  the  semester  to  remind students how course goals were addressed and reinforce their accomplishments during that class period.

## Locked-box game: BreakoutEdu

In a cooperative learning  situation,  students'  goal  achievements  are positively correlated; students perceive that they can reach learning goals if and only if the other students in the learning group also reach their goals.

Thus, students seek outcomes that are beneficial to all those with whom they are cooperatively linked. (Johnson &amp; Johnson 1990, p. 104)

This  quote  exemplifies  the  collaborative  and  cooperative  problemsolving elements of a playful activity used for a number of semesters with WCI students. Based upon the escape room model, generally impractical in a  classroom  or  online  class  setting, BreakoutEDU (Breakout,  Inc.)  asks groups of students to decipher clues to break into a locked box. It is worth noting  that  while  this  section  limits  itself  to  the  classroom  setting, BreakoutEDU is  also  available  as  an  online activity. The online version is transferable to many different instructional scenarios as well.

The kit can be used for a wide range of purposes and topics. Storylines can be created from the ground up, or users of the kit can turn to ideas shared by others. The WCI storyline involved helping the school mascot find  his  way  around  campus,  just  as  the  students  were  doing.  As  they learned  about  the  university  library,  the  students  were  also  developing some  basic  skills.  Clues  for  the  five  locks  were  scattered  among  the materials  the  instructors  included  in  the  backpack  (rucksack)  with  the game pieces. They were not highlighted in any way. Groups would primarily work as one full or a couple of smaller groups, but sometimes a student would go off on a hunch and work solo. The most successful groups were those that checked with one another throughout the process.

Each time student groups thought they might have found a clue based on a specific lock configuration (text, numbers or arrows), they would try it out. Groups that successfully opened all the locks would find a letter of congratulations inside with some sweets. The instructors' goal was to spur internal, rather than external, motivation, but there was also the desire to reward students for their persistence.

There were just two to three groups per class section, and the instructors could observe student interactions within groups closely. Only one student ever completely opted out and for reasons that were never entirely clear or explicitly  stated.  The  range  of  enthusiasm  within  the  groups  varied,  but most  got  into  a  competitive  spirit  and  wanted  to  succeed.  What  the instructors observed showed the truth of this observation: 'When individuals get stuck, they are more likely to give up, but groups are much more likely to find ways to keep going' (Johnson &amp; Johnson 1990, p. 104). Based on our observations, groups of students usually arrive at the same conclusion as the authors fairly quickly.

As groups opened the lockbox, the instructors would give each group two  cards  with  reflection  questions  at  the  end  of  the  allotted  time  for unsuccessful  groups.  Some  came  with  the  kit,  while  the  teaching  team

developed additional ones. In the autumn of 2017, these were the questions we asked groups:

- · Did you take any risks during the game? Why or why not?
- · How did your group utilise each individual's strengths?
- · What did playing this game tell you about yourself and your teammates?
- · Describe a moment when your team became frustrated. How can you avoid that next time?

After  the  groups  had  several  minutes  to  think  about  and  discuss  their responses, the instructors would ask each group to share those ideas with the class. Not every group was given the same questions, but the instructors did ask the others for some on-the-spot responses when the original group had finished giving their answers.

The reflection questions consistently generated on-topic discussions that  engaged  students.  Their  responses  generally  indicated  that  they were happy to have a group to rely upon and often described how they interacted  with  each  other  to  increase  success.  Taking  time  to  ask students to reflect on the role of the affective domain in new learning situations  helps  to  magnify  its  impact  and  increase  the  chance  that learners  will  react  positively  in  other  learning  scenarios.  Familiarising learners with metaliteracy will ground this metacognitive activity in the broader framework.

While one class session is insufficient to encourage students with a fixed mindset to accept the value of a growth mindset, having a session focused on this goal provides an opening for the instructor to return to the topic during the semester, helping to address this course goal.

BreakoutEDU centres  on  inquiry,  and  the  WCI  instructor  would  make this  connection  explicit  on  game  day  and  subsequent  classes.  It  gave students an innate connection to this core course activity. The third goal, group cohesiveness, was aided by the game. Students were immersed in working with their group teammates during a challenging activity. Generally, they  recognised  that  they  were  all  working  towards  the  same  goal  and could trust one another. The sense of play in the room focused on the three session  goals  and  underpinned  by  core  components  of  metaliteracy, provided  an  energetic  start  to  the  course.  Students  realised  that  what seemed daunting at first was potentially a series of problems they could solve working together.

The  teaching  team  also  tried  a  second  activity  with  students  during autumn 2021 and spring 2022. While it was designed to meet the same learning objectives, another one was added, focused on the metaliterate role of the learner as producer.

## Collaborative creation of an online whiteboard

Starting in the autumn 2021 semester, the WCI instructor and librarian team moved  to  a  new  activity  to  have  students  collaborate  as  information producers to create an online whiteboard representing a 'growth mindset'.

However,  because  this  activity  takes  place  in  the  first  week  of  the semester,  the  instruction  begins  with  content  specific  to  the  idea  of  a growth mindset and metaliteracy. The goal is for students to be conscious of  their  thought  processes,  emotions  and  behaviours as they engage in what is, for many of them, a process encapsulating some tensions: working closely with and making decisions with students whom they do not know. At  the  same  time,  they  are  also  trying  to  assess  the  other  students' commitment  to  the  idea  of  a  growth  mindset  as  they  develop  the collaborative whiteboard.

Before the class started, students worked through several online metaliteracy  activities,  including  one  called  'Failing  Better'  (O'Brien  2018, p. 192). They are introduced to Dweck's work on growth mindsets (2008), and at the end of the activity, they were invited to add their story of having actually failed better at some point in their life to an online wall. They are able to see what others, over the course of a number of years, have written about their own 'failing better' moments. This activity is just one of many to be found in the Metaliteracy Badging System project (Metaliteracy Learning Collaborative 2014). They are also assigned a short reading on metaliteracy. Students are invited  to  share  a  few  of  their  'Failing  Better'  responses  in  class.  The  four metaliteracy learning domains are explored, and then groups of students are asked to assess how their assigned domain impacts their learning. First, the students discuss the metaliteracy roles and their application in the course. They then continue to work collaboratively in a play-based activity designed to address course goals connected to developing a growth mindset, learning how  to  differentiate  between  open  versus  copyrighted  content,  and  the learner as producer.

The  activity  prompt  they  are  given  is  controlled  yet  challenging.  The control  is  provided  via  the  given  topic  -  a  growth  mindset  -  and  the designated, and most likely unfamiliar, tool - a Google Jamboard. While they are  creating  the  Google  Jamboard  collage,  which  allows  for  disparate content,  they  are  sensitised  to  the  roles  of  communicator,  collaborator, researcher and producer. This awareness encourages them to work more collaboratively, even though they all use their own computers while doing group work. They help each other to determine whether items are under an appropriate  Creative  Commons  (CC)  license  and,  therefore,  applicable. Students frequently teach their classmates, both within and across groups, platform features or how to find copyright-free images.

At the end of the time allowed for this activity, the instructors asked each team to present their Google Jamboard. Their pride in their teamwork is clear, as is their support for team members who have created or identified elements that are out of the ordinary. This debriefing allows time for groups not only to discuss their co-created Google Jamboard but also to begin to reflect  on  how  this  activity  connected  with  the  metaliteracy  learning domains and roles and with a growth mindset. Based on the findings of Keller (2008) and Woo (2014), they are situating the reflection after the activity as is done with these students.

## Play-based activities in upper-level courses

As we have seen, metaliteracy supports SDL through interactive activities that employ elements of PoPs in foundation courses at a lower level. This flexible pedagogical framework informs the design of collaborative social learning and meaning-making in upper-level courses as well. This section explores two advanced-level courses, 'Digital Storytelling' and 'Ethics of Digital Art and Design', at the SUNY Empire State College, New York State, USA. These fully online courses prepare self-directed learners to embrace several interrelated metaliterate learner roles, including researcher, producer, collaborator and teacher, as they construct knowledge through interactive learning activities in multiple modalities.

## Course: 'Digital Storytelling'

The fully online course, 'Digital Storytelling', is integral to the Digital Arts curriculum in the Department of Arts and Media. It is designed for a wide array of students from multiple disciplines.

The learning objectives of an earlier version of this course were analysed concerning the original broadly defined learning objectives introduced in the  first  metaliteracy  article  (Mackey  &amp;  Jacobson  2011,  pp.  70-76,  2014, pp.  185-206).  A  revised  version  of  this  course  has  been  updated  as  a collaborative  online  international  learning  (COIL)  experience  to  connect faculty and learners from Europe and the USA based on an international partnership  at  SUNY  Empire  State  College  (Mackey  &amp;  Aird  2022).  This global  course  integrates  metaliteracy  into  several  learning  activities  in support of self-directed learners who apply the theories and techniques of digital storytelling.

The course scaffolds learning about digital storytelling and metaliteracy based  on  feedback  from  peers  and  faculty.  Students  develop  several individual  digital  stories,  including  an  introductory  selfie-video,  a  mobile story,  a  digital  narrative  about  empowerment  and  a  final  selfie-video.

They  plan  the  stories  by  writing  scripts,  developing  storyboards  and applying  openly  available  digital  tools.  Thoughtful  planning  informs  the construction  of  three-  to  five-minute  narratives  that  combine  multiple modes such as digital images, video, audio narration and background music. As part of this process, they learn about CC licensing and are required only to use original digital images and video or to repurpose openly-licensed materials. In addition, they write peer reviews for their classmates based on the same digital storytelling rubric applied by the course instructors. The course culminates with a final collaborative project about a relevant social issue that students plan and produce together in small groups.

The course, 'Digital Storytelling', incorporates the metaliteracy framework into several learning activities based on an interactive version of the metaliteracy diagram (Mackey, Jacobson &amp; O'Brien 2020). The dynamic metaliteracy  framework  introduces  learners  to  the  learning  domains, learner  roles  and  characteristics,  and  links  to  related  questions.  Each question  allows  learners  to  reflect  on  their  relationship  to  the  different components and is tagged with the most relevant domain to show how the model is interrelated and holistic. The integrated model moves and spins as the learner engages with it, and all of the components include dynamic links that allow the learner to investigate the concepts on their own and at their own pace.

Throughout  the  course,  students  are  in  dialogue  via  three  online discussion forums about issues related to digital storytelling and through peer reviews associated with each project. As part of the first selfie-video assignment, they are asked to explore the interactive metaliteracy diagram, describe the metaliterate learner roles that they identify with the most and explain  why  they  made  these  selections.  They  build  this  analysis  of  the learner roles into the video and begin to reflect on who they are as learners. This assignment embodies several key roles, such as being a collaborator, participant  and  producer,  while  asking  students  to  consider  which  roles they recognise in their own lives. The next assignment is a mobile story in which learners reflect on how their mobile devices impact their storytelling production.  They  watch  a  metaliteracy  video  about  producing  digital narratives  that  reinforces  the  learner  roles  while  providing  the  essential elements  of  creating  an  effective  digital  story  as  a  metaliterate  learner (Telling Your Digital Story 2019). The next assignment explores the theme of empowerment, which embodies metaliteracy as a pedagogical framework for  inspiring  self-directed  learners  to  take  charge  of  the  narratives  they design and construct.

This final project involves social learning through  a  team-based assignment that requires planning and producing a digital story about a

social cause. The teams identify a specific social issue to advocate for, such as climate change, anti-racism efforts or social justice, and then develop a collaborative script and storyboard to produce a digital narrative. As part of this process, they identify production roles, such as a scriptwriter and storyboard  creator,  media  producer,  narrator,  on-camera  (on-air)  talent, editor and publisher, complementing the metaliterate learner roles. They also teach each other about information and communication technologies (ICTs) and other digital tools, research discoveries and digital storytelling production. In a related assignment, they engage in an online discussion about collaboration by answering questions from the interactive  metaliterate learner figure about the collaborator role. As a result, learners analyse the importance of effective collaboration in team projects and reflect on their many different experiences with teamwork in their own lives.

The last learning activity in 'Digital Storytelling' is a final selfie-video for students  to  assess  their  learning  based  on  the  metaliteracy  learner characteristics.  They  review  the  integrated  model  and  respond  to  the questions  posed  in  the  characteristics  sphere.  As  part  of  this  closing assignment, they fulfil the vision for SDL by Knowles (1975) to not only take charge of one's goals, identify resources and develop strategies but also to evaluate one's learning (Knowles 1975, p. 18). Through this reflective activity, they have the chance to see themselves as producers of information, a key objective of metaliteracy, that is realised through the meaning-making of their  own  personal  narratives  (Jacobson  et  al.  2018;  Lindqvist  2001; Nilsson 2009).

## Course: 'Ethics of Digital Art and Design'

The 'Digital Arts' curriculum at SUNY Empire State College addresses the responsibilities  of  producing  and  sharing  digital  media  art  through  the course  'Ethics  of  Digital  Art  and  Design'.  It  was  first  developed  as  an international blended residency in Cyprus, combining online and in-person instruction,  and  was  then  redesigned  as  a  fully  online  offering  (Mackey 2021). However, while the current iteration of the course does not engage with metaliteracy learning materials as directly as 'Digital Storytelling', the conceptual framing of metaliteracy undergirds the entire course.

The  description  and  learning  objectives  for  this  intensive  study  of ethics are influenced by metaliteracy to prepare reflective and informed learners who actively evaluate, produce and share digital art. In addition, the primary  learning  activities require learners to develop  several multimedia  publications using the Linkr Education platform (Linkr Education [Linkr Media Inc.] 2022). This work is reinforced through related online  discussions  based  on  openly  available  readings  and  resources.

Further, students in this course engage in a culminating group assignment to research and produce a digital media project that addresses a relevant topical issue related to ethics in the digital arts. Throughout the course, students teach and learn from each other in this collaborative setting as they engage with their peers in discussions and respond to each other's Linkr multimedia publications.

Each  of  the  assigned  multimedia  publications  in  Linkr  addresses  a specific  ethical  issue  explored  in  the  course  modules.  The  first  Linkr assignment explores the impact of digital media on our understanding of reality  as  explored  in  the  work  of  the  artist,  designer  and  technologist Jiabao  Li  (Li  2022).  In  the  second  publication,  students  produced  an original  digital  image  that  examines  the  issue  of  digital  manipulation  in digital photography through the study of the artist Cindy Sherman (Museum of  Modern  Arts  [MoMA]  2022).  The  third  Linkr  publication  explored anonymity related to the artist Banksy and the larger societal issues he raises in his art (Banksy 2022). As the course progresses, they also write about and produce digital images related to the challenges associated with defining objectivity in documentary photography and the ethical concerns of deep fake technology and the emerging metaverse.

As  self-directed  learners,  the  students  in  this  course  scaffold  their learning about these ethical concerns based on feedback from classmates and the instructor. They contribute to a process of meaning-making through the production of digital images and text that constitute their multimedia publications. As the students complete each publication, they also see that their contributions are automatically organised into a digital portfolio in Linkr that emerges from this process. In addition, the larger class space in this  shared  platform  reveals  all  the  publications  from  everyone  in  the course. This incremental process unfolds over time and reveals the collective contributions  of  all  students  as  metaliterate  researchers,  producers  and publishers.  In  many  ways,  each  assignment  is  an  ethical  problem  to  be solved,  or  at  least  examined  thoroughly,  to  reinforce  a  more  profound understanding among all of the course participants. The culmination of this work embodies the ethical responsibilities of information producers that is so core to metaliteracy.

## Conclusion

This chapter has examined play-based pedagogy, particularly concerning PBL, SDL and multimodality. The interconnections among these pedagogical concepts suggest that combining elements strengthens the opportunities for student learning. The chapter introduces a new component, metaliteracy, that overlaps and extends the conversation about the PoP as a dynamic

construct for teaching and learning. Connections are made between core components of metaliteracy, PBL or GBL, SDL and multimodality, suggesting a powerful yet easily adaptable teaching and learning strategy. Examples that  have  proved  effective  with  students  in  courses  at  different  levels illustrate how this might be implemented. However, the learning activities presented in this chapter are meant only as jumping-off points to inspire further investigation into the application of these ideas.

## Abstract

This conceptual study explains how playful problem-based learning (PPBL) could promote joyful learning experiences, to enhance self-direction and well-being  in  school  contexts,  including  and  beyond  early  childhood.  In recent years, the relevance of play in the educational process has received more attention, particularly pertaining to learning beyond early childhood

development  (ECD). Younger  generations seem  to desire fun and excitement and tend to rebel against inequality.  Furthermore,  there  has been growing attention given to the need to develop 21st-century skills. We argue that a focus on playful learning may contribute to young people having fun while engaging in authentic teaching and learning activities and feeling inspired and motivated to learn. In addition, problem-based learning (PBL)  allows  learners  to  engage  in  collaborative  teaching  and  learning activities with real-life value.

If teachers  promote  PPBL,  they  could  create  adventurous  learning environments  where  learners  are  encouraged  to  take  risks,  with  the assurance that it is safe to do so. Learners will consequently be actively involved  in  fun,  authentic  teaching  and  learning  activities  that  call  for curiosity, problem-solving and social interaction through playful learning. Through these activities, learners can appreciate various ways of knowing and learn more about their strengths and preferences. During these PPBL activities, learners could develop their identities and understand their roles within  their  communities.  By  implementing  PPBL,  teachers  have  the opportunity  to  transform  learning  and  foster  creative  and  self-directed learning (SDL) environments where learners are not afraid to take risks, can develop problem-solving mindsets, are innovative and feel motivated.

Within a PPBL environment, we believe that teachers and learners can continuously learn self-directedly, motivated by their interest in learning and their desire to experience a sense of belonging. Therefore, educators in PPBL environments need to cultivate a positive attitude towards fostering SDL skills within each learner's capacity so that learning can be experienced as  a  meaningful  activity.  Furthermore,  within  these  PPBL  environments, teachers must create fun, authentic and meaningful learning opportunities that enable learners to flourish.

## Introduction

This  chapter  aims  to  explain  how  authentic  PPBL  could  promote  joyful learning experiences  and  enhance  self-direction in school contexts, including and beyond early childhood. This chapter is informed by social constructivism as defined in Chapter 2 and is, therefore, embedded in the principles  of  learners  constructing  knowledge  actively;  learning  occurs through social interaction and is a human activity. Furthermore, learners create  meaning  through  interaction  with  others  and  their  environment, collaboratively solve problems and reach new ways of understanding. The chapter is informed by social constructivism and is justified by the fact that it could be applied through instructional methods such as PBL and develops independent problem-solving skills, which is vital for SDL. Ultimately, the aim is that learners become active co-constructors of knowledge through

self-directed  PPBL  (Dorgu  2015;  Kapur  2018;  Shah  2019).  Our  focus, therefore,  is  on  describing  the  nature  of  learning  and  the  classroom atmosphere in teaching and learning environments that will be conducive to  PPBL.  Finally,  we  will  explore  the  basic  characteristics  of  PPBL  by focusing on how these teaching and learning activities could promote a sense of belonging, joyful experiences, authentic and meaningful learning, and flourishing. Although PPBL is not explicitly defined in the literature, we drew from Barrett's (2005) work on how PBL can be fun and enjoyable and support the acquisition of 21st-century skills in higher education (HE). In this  chapter,  we  define  PPBL  as  experiences  where  learners  engage  in authentic, playful activities that are informed by PBL.

Much  research  has  been  done  on  PBL  over  many  years  (see  ch.  1), including the various characteristics associated with PBL and SDL. Knowles' (1975) definition of SDL, as referred to in Chapter 1, was also used as the working definition of SDL in this chapter. Without going into considerable detail regarding PBL and its connection to SDL, we argue that it is essential to highlight some critical aspects of PBL to provide the context for this chapter and the background against which we wrote this conceptual study. These aspects, which are derived from the work of Savery (2015), include, among others, that (1) learners need to take charge of and be accountable for their learning, (2) diverse disciplines or topics should be included in the curriculum and (3) working together is critical. Moreover, (4) the knowledge that  learners  acquire  via  SDL  has  to  be  applied  to  problems  that  need solving, which involves re-evaluating and finding a solution to the problem. Furthermore,  (5)  conducting  a  concluding  analysis  of  the  knowledge gained  and  the  ideas  and  principles  discovered  while  trying  to  find  a solution is vital. Subsequently, (6) learners should evaluate themselves and their  peers after solving a problem and completing each curricular unit. Lastly, an essential characteristic is that (7) the activities carried out in PBL must have real-life value.

The  aforementioned  PBL  characteristics  highlighted  align  with  the discussions that follow, which are about learning with, from and through others  and  collaborating  in  solving  challenging  problems  that  relate  to real-life.  The  PBL  characteristics  also  support  motivations  to  create  a classroom climate that allows for PBL through play-based learning to boost learners' ability to function as self-directed individuals (Barrett 2005). We argue that playful learning experiences could contribute toward learners' intrinsic motivation to solve the complex real-life problems they engage with during PBL activities. Providing learners with a teaching and learning environment immersed in real-life contexts is a crucial component of such an  approach  in  education.  Therefore,  contextual  learning  could  support PPBL as  it  creates  opportunities  for  learners  to  engage  with  and  solve meaningful real-life problems within these contexts.

From the above, we believe that contextual learning is not limited to area and location,  as  that  may  exclude,  for  example,  a  person's  identity  and abilities, to name a few. However, the content must be familiar to learners (De Jong 2006), meaning their prior knowledge must support the new information and skills they learn. This latter notion supports the idea that pedagogical  decisions  promote  or  inhibit  contextual  learning  (cf.  Leite 2017). Therefore, we concur with Overton (2007) that PBL could be part of contextual learning as it provides opportunities for learners to engage in authentic  learning  activities  within  meaningful  contexts.  This  argument necessitates  discussing  contextualised  learning  environments  and  how they support the PBL characteristics, as mentioned earlier.

## Contextualised learning environments

Contextualised learning environments in this chapter comprise education that places learners at the centre of class activities. Doing so requires that learning  is  based  on  group  work.  Learning  should  be  reciprocal  and vicarious, but through an engagement with the learning content, the learner should be able to identify themselves in what they learn (Leite 2017), which might increase their motivation to learn (Bennett, Lubben &amp; Hogarth 2007).

## Learning with , from and through others

This section is twofold. Firstly, it is focused on learning with others. Secondly, we address aspects of learning from and through others, which resemble how social-constructivist and cognitive learning theories underpin learning. Thus, the discussion in this section revolves around how learning in a PBL environment occurs with other learners, from other learners and through other learners. We believe that, as they develop, the learner goes through a  process  (resembling  a  journey)  that  continues  for  their  entire  life. Ultimately, learning with, from and through others could promote SDL to deliver self-directed individuals (the product). We maintain that, through PPBL, learners get the chance to learn, unlearn and relearn 1  in a learning environment where they can have fun while also generating solutions to problems they may face at the current moment or in the near future.

## Learning with others

In this chapter, the activity of learning with 'others' is based on the idea of learning together - in other words, constructing knowledge together

(Du Toit-Brits, Blignaut &amp; Mzuza 2021). The social-constructivist theory of learning  asserts that human  progress  is  socially  situated  and  that knowledge  is  generated  via  contact  with  others,  which  is  exemplified through collaboration and the formation of common understandings of events (McKinley 2015). The emphasis, therefore, is on the learning that occurs within the learner, based on their participation within a learning community. As a consequence of this collaborative learning, learners can extrapolate  and  disseminate  the  information  they  gain  in  a  lesson  via participation in a group conversation, which helps them develop a firm social basis to convey their thoughts about solutions to a problem verbally (McKinley 2015; Reznitskaya, Anderson &amp; Kuo 2007). Through collaborative learning experiences, understanding is developed through recognising a problem and a learning need, looking into it and finding a solution based on how previous experience has shaped cognition (Myburgh &amp; Tamarro 2013).  Learning  and  finding  knowledge  together  implies  learning  more than one would have learnt alone. Individuals acquire more information and  improve  their  ability  to  communicate  verbally  and  non-verbally because of the many interactions that occur when exploring together for answers to issues and learning needs (Arslan 2018). Thus, learning with others within one's context adheres to the PBL and SDL characteristic that requires group work to solve problems in educational settings (Du ToitBrits et al. 2021).

## Learning through and from others

Learning through and from others resembles learning first-hand or secondhand through the actions of someone who is also part of a community (cf. Gelman 2009; Harris 2012; Vygotsky 1978, 2012). This type of learning is  congruent with the social cognitive view of learning and is twofold learning  happens  by  repeating  behaviour  that  took  place,  or  learning happens by altering behaviour that occurred where the desired outcome was not reached (Woolfolk 2016).

Learning through each other, also known as observational learning, is a process where learners observe one another employing their engagement and then derive knowledge from those observations (Ormrod 2017). This type  of  learning  occurs  as  learners  interact  with  course  materials  and resources  and  communicate  about  possible  solutions  to  problems.  In addition, learners act as models for one another, which is how they learn new things; by acting as models for one another and demonstrating to one another how to carry out specific tasks or how certain problems may be addressed (Ormrod 2017). Within PPBL and collaborative learning contexts, social  interactions  could  emerge  among  learners  while  engaging  with content. Within these interactions, learners could benefit from discussing

various understandings of real-life problems to formulate solutions to these complex  problems.  Moreover,  these  interactions  provide  learners  with essential opportunities to learn through each other and from each other constructively  (Hendarwati,  Nurlaela  &amp;  Bachri  2021).  In  other  words, learning occurs in such a manner that learners can form understandings based on what they learn and experience from each other.

Learning from each other is associated with enactive learning, otherwise known as vicarious learning, which would consist, for example, of discovering something by seeing how the actions of another person play out in the world (Schunk 2016). The behaviours that lead to successful rewards are kept in place, whereas those that lead to failed outcomes are changed or abandoned  outright.  Learners  can,  therefore,  acquire  knowledge  by observing  the  actions  of  others  during  a  process  known  as  vicarious learning (Bandura, Ross &amp; Ross 1963).

We believe that allowing learners to learn with, through, and from their peers can enhance the development of the key abilities required for PBL and SDL (cf. Hurst, Wallace &amp; Nixon 2013; Lizcano-Dallos, Vargas-Daza &amp; Barbosa-Chacón 2019; University of Birmingham 2022). Among the many advantages cited by these sources is the enhancement of proficiency in PBL and SDL in the classroom. Some examples include encouraging literacy in relevant fields and learners learning to think critically and solve problems (Hurst  et  al. 2013).  Furthermore,  learning  through  social  interaction increases one's abilities in organisation, delegation, communication, cooperation,  leadership  and  the  ability  to  follow  others  (University  of Birmingham 2022). Learning with, through and from others helps cultivate rational thought and arguments, boosts leadership potential, and emphasises  the  significance  of  social  connection  and  communication (Lizcano-Dallos et al. 2019). In a broader sense, these abilities include group work,  managing  learning  tasks,  acting  autonomously,  applying  selfdiscipline,  being  open  to  constructive  feedback,  engaging  in  evaluation and  reflection,  engaging  in  critical  thinking,  being  accountable,  solving problems  creatively  and  communicating  effectively  (Kumashiro  2000). Learners, through their engagements with the learning content, resources and one another, are allowed to communicate verbally and non-verbally; they work together as a group; and, most importantly, in the process of testing what solutions work, creativity, critical thinking and self-direction in learning are promoted through fun activities and through the adaptations and decisions that they make (Hendarwati et al. 2021). This implies that when learners  are  given  problems  that  need  solving,  they  will  not  only solve these problems alone or as a collective; instead, problem-solving will be done in a manner where they seek solutions from multiple perspectives and multiple possibilities underpinned by the idea that every learner brings something unique to the table.

However, we argue that learning with others,  learning through others and  learning from others  is  insufficient  for  contextualised  education within a learning environment focused on PPBL and SDL. Moreover, we hold  that  learners  must  acquire  knowledge  about  themselves  via education centred on them and designed specifically for their learning needs and personal goals.

## Individualised learning: Learning that is for me and about me

Learning, or being exposed to opportunities to learn - such as through content about the learner or specifically designed and developed with the learner in mind - is important for the learner because they ought to be reflected in what they learn. For this discussion, we have used the notion of anti-oppressive education (AOE) by Kumashiro (2000). The four fundamental  tenets  of  Kumashiro's  notes  that  education  that  is  nonoppressive  should  (1)  be  for  and  (2)  about  the  other,  (3)  criticise  the privilege that some people enjoy and the dehumanisation of people, and (4) alter the learner and the community.

Education for the other is epitomised by the idea that the learning process no longer captures a person but instead liberates (Freire 1993; Kumashiro 2000). Offering such education matches the characteristics of PBL and SDL in that education for the other can empower the learner to take responsibility and be accountable for their learning. Therefore, learners can understand that they are appreciated and that the challenges they experience daily are, to  a  degree,  included  in  their  education.  Through  PBL  and  SDL,  learners ultimately seek solutions to the challenges of improving their lives.

In education about the other, emphasis on 'othered' persons necessitates teaching all learners about the 'other' (Kumashiro 2000) because everyone experiences 'othering' or exclusion. From this point of view, education has the  potential  to  take  on  a  contextual  quality  because  learners  will  gain knowledge  and  skills  about  individuals  who  are  often  overlooked  and whose experiences and methods of operation are not typically considered genuine. Furthermore, while working as a group, learners communicate, search for and generate answers to issues. They have the chance to be exposed to the opinions of others, especially those peers who may not be as willing to answer questions or feel silenced because they are viewed as 'different' or less valued (Du Toit-Brits et al. 2021).

Providing  learners  with  learning  opportunities  to  discover  their  role within  a  social  structure  where  they  are  alienated  and  benefitted  helps them  understand  how  their  lives  are  intertwined  with  those  of  others. Through  reflection,  learners  become  aware  of  how  their privileges  may

oppress  their  peers (Kumashiro  2000),  including  how  they  think,  the reference points they draw inspiration from or the solutions to problems they  generate.  Therefore,  individual  and  societal  change  can  only  be achieved  through  an  education  where  learners  are  made  aware  of  the problems that their fellow citizens face (Kumashiro 2000). Because of this kind of education, learners (and educators) may be confronted with their preconceived notions or assumptions. However, more importantly, learners may realise that every learner has a voice and should be allowed to express themselves in safe academic engagements that are a requirement for the successful  completion  and  learning  of  tasks.  Although  they  may  feel exposed, they can also develop a heightened awareness of their assumptions about  the  knowledge  they  possess.  Doing  so  makes  it  possible  for  the educator and learners to understand one another better.

Learning with, from and through the other, as well as education for the other and about the other, are geared towards challenging the status quo for individuals  and  societies  that  strive or need to be transformed ,  thus enabling  learners  to  learn  together  as  a  collective  (Kumashiro  2000). Moreover, learners can assess what they learn and know, unlearn what they know  together  and  separately;  but  most  importantly,  relearn  on  a continuously negotiated basis during the various interactions that occur while learning (cf. Klein 2008; Tome 2021). Although Kumashiro's notion of AOE did not aim to advance PBL or SDL, it does. By learning with others, from others and through others, SDL skills are developed, and by implication, these  skills  can  be  used  when  learners  engage  in  PBL  (cf.  Hmelo-Silver 2004).  We  believe  that  learning,  with  others,  from  others  and  through others expands one's knowledge base but also one's ability to do things practically  or  perform  practical  tasks,  which  can  significantly  enhance learning, especially in PBL, where learners have to solve real-life problems.

Contextual  education  is,  therefore,  focused  on  how  learners  engage  in learning activities both individually and collaboratively, which aligns with the characteristics of social constructivism, PBL and SDL. Because the type of education represented in the discussions above is centred on and relevant to learners, they should be motivated to engage and take pleasure in the learning process. Learning environments prioritising the learner and having their best interests at heart are associated with an ethic of care (Joorst 2021). However, contextual education is only successful, bearing in mind that a constructive and encouraging classroom atmosphere needs to be created by the educator. This  latter  notion  emphasises  the  central  notion  of  human  nature  in  the learning process, which depends on the educator and learner interacting with each other to offer individualised learning as opposed to adaptive learning that  is  underpinned  by  technology  monitoring  learner  progress,  among others, to determine the way forward for learning to take place.

## Creating a constructive classroom atmosphere for learner-centred learning

Studies have shown that a classroom focused on learner engagement can be more constructive, as teachers must find approaches to engage all learners  (Allen,  Vella-Brodrick  &amp;  Waters  2016;  Allen  et  al.  2018,  2021; Arslan  &amp;  Duru  2017).  A  classroom  atmosphere  that  promotes  learnercentred  learning  is  crucial  for  learners  to  learn  and  develop  optimally (Arslan 2021; Arslan, Allen &amp; Ryan 2020). Creating a classroom atmosphere that promotes learner-centred learning takes effort from both the teacher and the learners. We believe that teachers can change their classroom atmosphere  into  an  enjoyable,  encouraging  and  supportive  learning environment by setting a positive example, implementing social constructivism principles, PPBL skills, joyful learning and building trust to mention only a few.

When we look deeper into what a classroom atmosphere entails, it involves the attitudes, mindsets, feelings, thoughts, standards, ideas and climate  that  teachers  and  learners  may  experience  in  their  classroom (Arslan 2021; Joorst 2021). On the one hand, for example, learners can experience  a  hostile  classroom  atmosphere  when  feeling  confused, intimidated, restrained and unable to take ownership of learning. On the other  hand,  learners  can  experience  a  positive  classroom  atmosphere when they have fun, where they can be authentic, have the freedom to be silly and often laugh - all while also feeling safe and protected, respected, recognised, valued, accepted, encouraged and supported in their learning (Arslan et al. 2020).

Furthermore, as the teacher frequently sets the tone in their classroom, learners  must  be  motivated,  organised,  self-directed,  confident  and caring (Joorst 2021). Drawing on an extensive range of sources (cf. Allen et al. 2016, 2018, 2021; Arslan &amp; Duru 2017), we maintain that a supportive classroom  is  a  learning  environment  in  which  a  learner  has  a  secure place to connect to learning, is driven to be autonomous and to belong, is permitted  to interact with other learners intellectually and  is encouraged to be more self-directed. Learners should work in teams in a  PPBL atmosphere, which necessitates the establishment of learning centres in which they assume leadership positions and duties, communicate both verbally and in writing, and accept responsibility for their learning and that of their teammates (cf. Nilson 2016). In this group, learners are given authentic learning opportunities to think critically and communicate creatively with content and group members. Doing so can maintain  a  supportive  classroom  where  learners  belong  and  have  a secure place to connect to learning.

## The importance of a constructive and encouraging classroom atmosphere

Considering what has been argued so far, it is clear that creating a safe and welcoming learning space is crucial if teachers are to help their learners develop a sense of independence and responsibility for their own learning, as well as a desire to actively engage in class, make meaningful contributions to group projects and ultimately succeed academically (Allen et al. 2021; Arslan 2018, 2021). Learners are more inclined to be motivated, inspired to learn and encouraged to achieve more profound knowledge when they feel respected and in charge of their learning (Allen et al. 2018). We believe that a constructive and encouraging classroom atmosphere can help learners think critically, solve authentic challenges, discover, understand, evaluate and implement learning resources while using subject matter knowledge, problem-solving skills and SDL skills to develop into persistent self-directed learners. Consequently, learners are not passive receivers of knowledge but are required to acquire the knowledge actively (Allen et al. 2018; Arslan 2018). Therefore, it can be assumed that the teaching context must permit learners  to  move  beyond  a  passive  role,  be  exposed  to  a  constructive classroom atmosphere and cultivate a sense of self-direction in seeking knowledge. The teaching context must also motivate learners to practise higher-level critical thinking skills. Because  this  cognitive  education approach builds on the learner's knowledge, the constructivist classroom atmosphere  is  centred  on  the  learners'  interests.  It  also  emphasises interactive teaching and learning, where learners have conversations with teachers to assist them in creating knowledge.

From what we posed earlier, it can be deduced that a PPBL classroom atmosphere  can  impact  learning.  The  learning  experience  in  the  PPBL environment  should  be  filled  with  excitement,  pleasure,  satisfaction, achievement and joy. The classroom atmosphere mentioned above might encourage enjoyable,  authentic  learning.  However,  the  emotions  of  fear, guilt and  boredom  demotivate  learners  in  the  classroom.  In  PPBL classrooms,  where  learners  feel  secure  being  themselves,  they  may  use their  life  experiences  to  engage  creatively  with  problems  and  learning material.

## A sense of belonging as a precondition for ownership of learning

According to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD 2019), one in three (1:3) learners lack a sense of belonging. Research (Allen et al. 2020, 2021; Arslan 2018) confirms the significance of embedding a constructive and positive classroom atmosphere to promote a sense of

belonging which we also believe to be accurate within PPBL contexts. Safe and secure classroom settings play an important role in creating a sense of belonging (in any form of learning environment). Furthermore, a sense of belonging in PPBL classrooms must open the space for cooperation and connectedness (Allen et al. 2020; Joorst 2021). In this PPBL space of trusting connections, learners can identify with their classroom, problems and learning (Lester &amp; Cross 2015; Reynolds et al. 2017). Allen et al. (2020) believe that a sense of belonging is where learners can feel individually recognised,  accepted  and  part  of  the  group.  Research  on  the  role  of belonging in learning has constructed a view of how learners can optimally perform in a learning environment, be more self-directed in their learning, and how the role of belonging can improve learners' academic success and enable them to be more active in their learning (Allen et al. 2018; Martinez-Callaghan &amp; Gill-Lacruz 2017). In addition, Ryan and Deci's selfdetermination theory (2000b) suggests that the grouping of constructive interactions endorses autonomy, understanding and competency, joined with  constructive  and  encouraging  classroom  experiences  that  inspire learners to be concerned  about school. We  maintain that these aforementioned  features  mentioned  should  be  embedded  in  a  PPBL classroom atmosphere for learners to experience a sense of belonging.

A sense of belonging has steadily been perceived as more relevant in light of recent research that shows how a sense of belonging in a learning community is encouragingly associated with learner engagement, motivation, behaviour and performance (Maestas, Vaquera &amp; Zehr 2017). Unfortunately, educational research has devoted far too little attention to understanding belonging, especially the effect of belonging within learning environments on learners' desire to take responsibility for their learning and be more self-directed.

As a result, this identified gap in the body of scholarship points to a need to comprehend the significance of belonging for acquiring ownership of one's learning (Du Toit-Brits 2022). Therefore, this chapter offers valuable insights into how a sense of belonging is a necessary constituent of PPBL, which itself is imperative for cultivating SDL skills. Maslow's (1962) research categorises love and belongingness at the centre of his order of needs. He  further  states  that  belonging  to  a  learning  community  can  increase learners' motivation and that this sense of belonging needs to be recognised as a necessary human component (Maslow 1970, 1987). So, this chapter harmonises Maslow's argument by signifying that a sense of belonging is essential for being a motivated, self-directed and self-determined learner. For this chapter, it should be emphasised that constructive and motivating learning experiences, such as pleasant learning, may stimulate a feeling of belonging and cognitive processing through intrinsic motivation. Learners may improve their self-efficacy, self-determination and self-direction, and

satisfy their need for ownership and competence if they experience a sense of belonging. Du Toit-Brits (2022) believes that:

- […]  learners  with  intrinsic  motivation,  self-determination,  and  a  sense  of belonging  are  expected  to  employ  SDL  skills  like  critical  thinking,  problemsolving skills, autonomy, communication, taking ownership, taking responsibility, being accountable, and reflection. (p. 62)

Therefore,  teachers  must  employ  several  active  instructional  strategies, such as PBL, cooperative learning (CL) and play-based learning, where the educational  activities  focus  on  cultivating  SDL  skills.  Through  these strategies,  belonging  can  be  embedded  within  these  constructive  and encouraging classrooms where teachers consider learners' learning needs (Allen et al. 2021). Thus, teachers must show thoughtfulness and care for their learners, which is essential for developing a sense of ownership and self-directedness in their classrooms.

Learners could experience a heightened sense of classroom belonging when they take ownership of and are responsible and accountable for their learning. When learners feel they belong to a classroom, it becomes 'their classroom' and 'their school'. Du Toit-Brits (2022) believes that it is essential for  learners  to  belong  within  a  learning  environment,  as  this  belonging gives them a sense of purpose and meaning. We argue that it is necessary that learners feel more empowered in the classroom through actively being a member of their classroom community, where they can feel that they are cared for and that their ideas are valued. Therefore, we believe that teachers should present learners with learning opportunities centred on a communal orientation that can support learners to know they are in a safe learning atmosphere where errors are acceptable. Subsequently, classrooms should be  seen  as  learning  environments  inviting  learners  to  feel  at  home.  We propose that Teachers can cultivate learners' sense of acceptance, support, self-direction, joy and belonging actively implementing PPBL environments.

## What is play-based learning, and why is it important?

Before motivating the importance of play-based learning (see ch. 2), we want to draw attention to some paradoxes between formal education and play-based learning. Formal educational settings tend to focus on and call for  measurable  outcomes  and  are,  therefore,  often  product-oriented, whereas play-based learning is concerned with the process of play (Whitton 2018). Furthermore, Lynneth Solis et al. (2021) describe play as timeless and accessible, often messy and seemingly chaotic, as compared to school contexts  that  aspire  to  create  order  and  where  timetables  frequently govern schools oppressively. In addition, play encourages risk-taking and provides opportunities for students to take responsibility for their learning

instead  of  school  environments  that  prioritise  predictability  and  safety where  the  teacher  sets  the  agenda  (Lynneth  Solis  et  al.  2021;  Mardell, Lynneth Solis &amp; Bray 2019). Despite these paradoxes, we advocate that play-based learning could provide valuable opportunities for teachers to challenge the status quo. By including playful activities in teaching and learning,  learners  could  have  many  opportunities  to  develop  autonomy, agency and self-direction and take ownership of their learning through fun, free and interactive activities.

In  recent years, studies and discussions have increasingly focused on the value of play in education beyond early childhood education (ECE). Recent studies have drawn attention to the various motivations that can be made for including playful approaches in education (Baker, Le Courtois &amp; Eberhart 2023; Leather, Harper &amp; Obee 2021; Lynneth Solis et al. 2021). These  studies  focus  on  how  play-based  learning  could  support  holistic development and foster social skills, motivation, creativity, problem-solving and coping skills through authentic teaching and learning experiences that are  empowering  and  meaningful.  Although  ways  that  technology  and innovative  strategies  could  support  play-based  learning  have  recently featured prominently in innovative teaching approaches - such as escape rooms, game-building and digital games, it seems that there has also been a  move back to more traditional games and general playful activities in education (Whitton 2018). This move could be ascribed to the fact that there has been an increased awareness of inequality between communities and insufficient resources in poorer schools. For example, in South Africa, many public schools serve learners  who  do  not  have  sufficient  Internet access or access to smart devices (cf. StatsSA 2020). Within these contexts, there  is  a  need  to  find  ways  to  utilise  play-based  learning  approaches without relying on technological advances.

## Defining play-based learning

When  defining play-based learning or playful learning, we must acknowledge that how play-based learning is viewed is context specific. While  play  is  often  considered  universal  for  children,  adolescents  and adults, the concepts and practices of how we play, whom we play with and when we play differ between contexts and across ages (Kangas et al. 2022; Lynneth Solis et al. 2021). Therefore, when designing play-based activities, teachers need to consider not only learner development when designing playful  teaching  and  learning  opportunities  but  also  cultural values, socio-economic backgrounds, religion and belief systems, sociopolitical  issues  and  ethnicity  (Mardell  et  al.  2019).  There  are  numerous conceptualisations and definitions for play in education. Many describe playful learning as fun, a joyful process that calls on the imagination and

creates opportunities for laughing and joking. Play also develops learners to  reach  their  full  potential,  fosters  social  skills  and  promotes  holistic development (Barrett 2005; Leather et al. 2021; Poikela &amp; Poikela 2005). Baker et al. (2023) further describe how playful learning occurs in contexts that are not only pleasurable but also flexible. They argue that it is within these  active,  fun  contexts  that  learners  can  assign  meaning  to  their learning.

Play-based learning is also closely associated with social constructivism and experiential learning (Leather et al. 2021). Play-based learning (Poikela &amp;  Poikela  2005)  requires  learners  to  be  immersed  in  active  learning experiences focused on and designed around genuine life problems and social  issues.  In  addition,  play  requires  an  open  mindset  from  learners whenever it offers them opportunities to engage in learning experiences that are discovery-based, creative and voluntary (Leather et al. 2021). We agree with Kangas et al. (2022, p. 6), who outline play as a process where learners do not learn 'through cognitive assignments but more through a way of being, living and perceiving the world'. Mardell et al. (2019, p. 5) further  argue  that  'schools  [have  to]  exist  for  reasons  beyond  mere efficiency' and that taking risks should be an integral part of daily activities and learning. The LEGO® Foundation identifies five characteristics of playbased learning, namely that learning (1) happens through joyful activities, (2)  requires  active  engagement,  (3)  is  meaningful,  (4)  provides  opportunities for social interaction and (5) calls for iterative thinking (experimentation) (LEGO® Foundation 2017).

Ultimately, we believe that play offers opportunities for joyful learning through which learners can develop their full potential, experience increased well-being  and  flourish.  Unfortunately,  it  could  be  argued  that  play  is  a privilege (Whitton 2018) because it is not necessarily an experience that all learners have access to. However, we want to argue that playful learning is the right of learners of all ages because play is an inherent part of human nature.

## Striving toward fostering 21st-century skills

Playful learning could be essential in fostering 21st-century skills because playful learning is equally social and cognitive and draws learners to focus on concrete and abstract ideas. Twenty-first-century skills include problemsolving,  collaboration,  language  proficiency,  critical  thinking,  creativity, decision-making and using digital technologies (Ananiadou &amp; Claro 2009; Karatas &amp; Arpaci 2021). Through playful approaches, learners can engage in  teaching  and  learning  experiences  that  consider  various  perspectives and ways of knowing, encourage social learning and link learning to real life,  reflecting  social  constructivism  principles.  Through  playful  learning,

learners have opportunities to explore various social issues, such as power relations and inequality, and solve complex problems through collaboration and  critical  reflection  (Lombardi  2007).  Learners  who  engage  in  playbased learning and PBL can build connections through group work, practice time management, and be innovative and creative when solving problems (Department  of  Basic  Education  [DBE]  2020).  Playful  learning  further promotes  self-management  skills,  awareness  of  others  and  a  positive attitude (Leather et al. 2021). Lombardi (2007) argues that connectionbuilding and creativity are essential 21st-century skills, as they foster life skills  that  will  be  important  and  valuable  once  learners  enter  the  employment sector. If learners are to develop the skills needed to become successful and self-directed adults, teachers must create playful environments where learners will feel free and safe.

## Creating safe, playful spaces

Before considering what safe, playful  spaces  look  like,  we  must  acknowledge that not all play is inherently associated with practical learning. Because of the social nature of play, educators must be aware that playful activities create opportunities for cruelty and discrimination as a result of power relations and societal inequality (Wood 2010) and inappropriate behaviour within diverse social contexts (Moon-Seo &amp; Munsell 2022). If learners are exposed to discrimination, bullying or cruelty during play, it can inhibit their learning (Wood 2010). It could further be argued that pre-existing power relations and inequalities mean that we cannot create playful spaces that will indeed be safe for all learners (Whitton 2018). Similarly, teachers must realise  that  it  is  impossible  to  create  playful  learning  experiences that will intrinsically motivate all learners and that they will not always be able to mediate failure. Therefore, learners need to find ways to design playful activities that are fair and that will encourage feelings of safety. Teachers  must  encourage  'ongoing  conversations'  (Whitton  2018,  p.  4) between themselves  and  learners  to  foster  motivation,  navigate  power relations  and  avoid  inequality.  To  this  end,  safe,  playful  spaces  must prioritise process over product and promote an ethic of care and respect (Baker et al. 2023).

If learners feel that their opinion is valued, they may be more open to engaging  in  PPBL  activities,  which  could  influence  their  intrinsic motivation. In addition, safe, playful spaces could provide environments where learners can engage in peaceful settings with opportunities and time  to  explore,  collaborate  and  feel  supported  (Kangas  et  al.  2022). Yet,  it  is  essential  to  note  that  engaging  in  fun  activities  does  not automatically  result  in  safe,  enjoyable  learning  opportunities.  Instead, through learner-centred approaches and an ethic of care, safe learning

spaces  will  be  constructed  over  time  during  reciprocal  teaching  and learning processes and by building relationships and trust within a fluid and  evolving  learning  space  (Mardell  et  al.  2019;  Whitton  2018).  The implication  is  that  students  will  be  fully  active  in  the  education  and learning process by establishing objectives and collaboratively resolving issues within dynamic and ever-changing learning settings. Ultimately, teachers must strive to create safe, playful learning environments that are accessible, where learners are relaxed, and that encapsulate social justice,  foster  empathy,  offer  positive  challenges  and  foster  trusting relationships (Lynneth Solis et al. 2021; Mardell et al. 2019; Whitton 2018) resembling a democratic teacher rather than an autocratic one.

## Authentic, meaningful learning through play

Through  PPBL,  learners  could  create  meaning  from  interactive,  social learning  experiences  that  encourage  creativity,  divergent  thinking  and problem-solving (Wood 2009). Suppose teachers want to design authentic and  meaningful  play-based  learning  activities.  In  that  case,  they  must provide  learners  with  opportunities  to  engage  in  experiential,  problembased,  fun  learning  activities  that  relate  to  their  real  lives  and  foster connection  (Kangas  et  al.  2017).  Playful  learning  will  be  authentic  and meaningful  if  learners  regard  such  learning  as  essential  and  if  they  are interested and invested in their learning. Accordingly, it is paramount that learners are aware of the real-life value of playful learning activities. Learners must  also  feel  inspired  and  motivated  to  fully  engage  in  their  learning activities (Lynneth Solis et al. 2021; Poikela &amp; Poikela 2005) through curious discovery and discussing real-world issues (Baker et al. 2023).

Authentic playful learning should lead to increased learner engagement and foster creativity and collaboration. Authentic playful learning  should  also  provide  safe  spaces  where  learners  can  imagine and explore various ideas and perspectives to solve relevant problems through questioning (Lynneth Solis et al. 2021) and iterative thinking, which involves a logical and systematic thinking process (Mardell et al. 2019). Lombardi (2007) identifies critical elements that define authentic learning experiences. She explains how authentic learning experiences must have real-life value and that learners must solve challenging and ill-defined problems. Like Lynneth Solis et al. (2021), Lombardi (2007) also  explains  that  learners  must  engage  with  diverse  perspectives through collaboration and critical reflection.

When designing authentic and meaningful PPBL activities, teachers must consider how their assessment strategies will reflect real-world evaluation processes.  Doing  so  implies  that,  rather  than  being  merely  summative, assessment  strategies  need  to  accommodate  different  interpretations  of

outcomes and numerous, varied solutions to problems (Lombardi 2007). We also believe that the nature of relationships is central to how learners experience authentic playful activities. Relationships are not only integral to meaningful teaching and learning experiences. Instead, fostering meaningful connections  is  also  an  important  life  skill  (Kangas  et  al.  2022;  Lombardi 2007). We ultimately agree with Lombardi (2007) that '[a]uthentic learning may be more important than ever in a rapidly changing world, where the half-life  of  information  is  short,  and  individuals  can  expect  to  progress through multiple careers':

Although foundational skills (reading, writing, mathematics, history, language) remain  essential,  a  more  complex  set  of  competencies  are  required  today. These  go  beyond  being  technically  competent  to  being  able  to  get  things done, demonstrate ethics and integrity, and work well with others. According to employers, the most important skills in new hires include teamwork, critical thinking […], […] organising information, and […] creativity. (p. 10)

We believe that the skills associated with problem-solving, questioning, iterative thinking and connection promote SDL, as they prepare learners with  valuable  life  competencies  that  are  also  the  basis  for  vocational readiness.

## Playful problem-based learning supports self-directed learning

We argue that PPBL is closely associated with SDL and self-determination theory, as it requires learners to manage their learning through autonomy, relatedness, motivation, problem-solving, critical reflection and  selfactualisation (Karatas &amp; Arpaci 2021; Loeng 2020; Ryan et al. 2021). We concur with Lynneth Solis et al. (2021, p. 6), who argue that contextually relevant 'playful learning provides opportunities for [learners] to become confident, self-directed learners […] who can participate in a democratic society and engage in the 21st-century economy'. We further argue that PPBL is a means through which learners can authentically develop the skills associated with SDL by being empowered, being motivated, developing agency,  developing  self-actualisation,  being  creative,  solving  problems, experiencing a sense of belonging and developing coping skills when they deal with various challenges.

## Being empowered

When we refer to how learners are empowered through PPBL, we keep in mind how playful learning supports learners to make decisions, set their own goals and take ownership of their learning (Karatas &amp; Arpaci 2021; Lynneth Solis et al. 2021), which are essential skills associated with SDL

(also see ch. 1). Lynneth Solis et al. (2021) describe empowered learning as learning that fosters agency, motivates independence, creates a sense of belonging and allows learners to be free, develop confidence and be proud of  their  achievements.  Playful  learning  spaces  provide  learners  with opportunities to develop and practice independence through an iterative, collaborative process which in turn empowers them (Husbye et al. 2012). Playful learning further empowers learners by encouraging them to take risks within safe spaces, co-construct rules, express their opinions, engage in  discussions  and  debates,  and,  importantly,  also  learn  that  there  is  no shame in asking for help (Lynneth Solis et al. 2021). When learners feel empowered, they can gain confidence in their ability to succeed, influencing their motivation, agency and self-directedness in learning.

## Being motivated

One of the essential skills that could be developed through authentic PPBL is intrinsic motivation . Motivation is also an essential aspect of autonomy (Ryan et al. 2021), as it influences how people behave, how and why they engage  in  certain  activities,  and  how  they  make  decisions  and  interact socially.  Through  motivation  (intrinsic  and  extrinsic),  learners  should  be encouraged  to  take  responsibility  and  control  their  learning,  become autonomous learners and achieve meaningful learning outcomes (Garrison 1997). Although learners could also experience extrinsic motivation based on reward and academic success when engaging in playful activities, we argue that intrinsic motivation is more critical and effective considering long-term  needs  for  self-directedness  and  well-being.  For  example,  if learners  believe  that  PPBL  activities  are  valuable,  and  if  such  learning occurs within safe spaces, learners could experience a heightened sense of intrinsic motivation to engage in playful learning activities (Whitton 2018). Intrinsic motivation will encourage learners to be more self-directed, take risks and experiment in conditions where they feel free and safe and that the learning has personal meaning for them (Kangas et al. 2017; Leather et al. 2021; Whitton 2018).

On  the  contrary,  we  hold  that  if  learners  only  experience  extrinsic motivation  during  PPBL  activities,  it  could  lead  to  resentment  and disinterest in continued engagement with this type of learning. This notion is also supported by the work of Ryan and Deci (2000a), who wrote that extrinsic motivation could be associated with resistance and disinterest if learners participate in actions without intention. If we suppose that learners are willing to engage in such learning activities for fun and personal gain, it could lead to associating the activities with a feeling of inherent satisfaction. Consequently, learners could be more likely to develop agency (Baker et al. 2023) and flourish as self-directed learners.

## Developing agency

Learners' agency is developed when they have opportunities to take control of their learning and willingly participate while feeling intrinsically motivated (Baker et al. 2023; Ryan et al. 2021). We argue that PPBL activities provide valuable opportunities for learners to take control of their learning and that these activities will promote intrinsic motivation and self-direction. When learners have agency, they are committed to their learning and can make decisions independently. Responsibility is an essential aspect of agency, as learners also need to consider how their decisions and choices will influence their course of action in the future. Through agency, learners also develop new,  creative  ways  of  doing  things.  This  is  a  vital  skill  for  coping  with challenges, solving problems and being more self-directed (Kangas et al. 2022). Agency, therefore, also influences learners' ability to self-regulate when they experience pressure or face challenges during playful learning because they  must  continuously  reflect  on  and  evaluate  their  decisions when faced with new problems (Baker et al. 2023). This ability to deal with and overcome challenges could, in turn, foster determination and resilience and  support  the  development  of  skills  that  are  associated  with  selfactualisation and SDL.

## Developing self-actualisation

Motivation and agency are essential skills to develop if learners are to experience self-actualisation and reach their full potential (Loeng 2020). One of the key benefits of playful learning beyond early childhood is that it  contributes  to  personal  growth  and  self-actualisation  (Leather  et  al. 2021). Through engagement in PPBL, learners can develop the ability to control their emotions, deal with conflict, act with care and compassion, and  accept  diverse  opinions.  Self-regulation  is  an  essential  aspect  of self-actualisation. It can be developed through playful learning because playful  spaces  require  learners  to  adapt  their  behaviours  and  control their  emotions  while  working  collaboratively  to  explore  and  engage with authentic problems (Baker et al. 2023). Henricks (2014) writes about how play cultivates  selfhood,  which  relates  to  how  people  understand themselves,  their  experiences,  abilities  and  roles  within  communities and  society  (Leather  et  al.  2021).  When  learners  engage  in  playful learning,  they  learn  about  themselves  and  others  within  specific  and diverse  contexts  through  agency,  motivation,  exploration,  questioning, collaboration and problem-solving. Within these playful contexts, learners also  explore  their  abilities  and  are  confronted  with  diverse  beliefs  and ways of knowing. They are further required to negotiate their beliefs with the  beliefs  of  others,  which  supports  self-realisation  (Henricks  2014; Leather et al. 2021). We believe that self-realisation is a stepping-stone to

self-actualisation and self-directedness and that motivation and agency are integral processes that must take place if learners are to reach their full potential.

## Developing creativity and problem-solving skills through hard fun

As  previously  stated,  creativity  and  problem-solving  are  essential  21stcentury skills that help to promote SDL (Loeng 2020; Lynneth Solis et al. 2021; Ryan &amp; Deci 2000b). Creativity is also an essential part of PBL and central to notions of play-based learning (Poikela &amp; Poikela 2005). When learners have opportunities to engage in playful learning within safe spaces, they have to be creative when faced with problems (Leather et al. 2021) and  engage  in  activities  where  they  individually  and  collaboratively explore  various  solutions  to  solve  problems  and  overcome  challenges (Andreopoulou &amp; Moustakas 2019).

Poikela  and  Poikela  (2005)  write  about  how  playful  learning  is associated with 'hard fun' (p. 162) and argue that problem-solving and facing challenges are closely associated with playful learning and PBL. The term 'hard fun' was initially coined by Papert (1996), who argued that  learners  have  fun  learning because the  learning  activities  are difficult, even though it is challenging. According to Poikela and Poikela (2005),  hard  fun,  therefore,  defines  learning  as  fun  and  challenging simultaneously. When learners learn through hard fun, they can challenge themselves  while  also  experiencing  'enjoyment,  laughter,  freedom, creativity and energy' (Poikela &amp; Poikela 2005, p. 162). They explain that learning is only meaningful because it is hard and learners tend only to enjoy  learning  if  it  presents  challenges.  Ultimately,  failure  is  a  critical factor  in  hard  fun,  and  authentic  PPBL  can  help  to  foster  resilience through iterative engagement (Whitton 2018). We believe that failure in playful  learning  (games),  for  instance,  allows  the  learner  to  try  again without feeling ashamed. Playful problem-based learning is meaningful because it challenges learners to find innovative solutions to problems and engage with new ways of knowing. When writing about how PPBL supports joyful learning and promotes SDL and flourishing, we specifically have hard fun in mind rather than seemingly superficial and frivolous play (Leather et al. 2021; Poikela &amp; Poikela 2005). When teachers design PPBL activities,  they  must  create  spaces  for  learners  to  feel  free  and safe,  where  they  are  actively  engaged  and  immersed  in  learning,  can collaborate with peers, have fun, can be silly and laugh, can be creative and innovative, and are ultimately challenged (Poikela &amp; Poikela 2005). Learners  need  opportunities  to  engage  in  playful  spaces  where  they are  motivated  to  exercise  their  agency,  foster  relationships,  learn  to

self-direct,  persevere,  and  solve  problems  to  reach  self-actualisation and flourish.

## Playful problem-based learning promotes well-being

We  believe  that  the  characteristics  of  agency,  choice-making,  goalsetting and iterative thinking associated with PPBL also align with hope theory  (Snyder  2002).  Intrinsic  motivation  similarly  plays  a  role  in hope theory, problem-solving abilities, optimism and self-efficacy. Hope theory  describes  how  individuals  strive  toward  attaining  their  goals through  agency,  emotional  regulation,  and  thinking  pathways  that describe  adaptive  thinking  and  critical  reasoning.  In  turn,  adaptive thinking  and  critical  reasoning  are  skills  that  enable  individuals  to cope  with  and  overcome  the  various  challenges  that  influence  and determine agency.

In  addition,  by  prioritising  obstacles  in  learning,  hard  fun  is  also concerned with laughter, independence and satisfaction (Poikela &amp; Poikela 2005).  Consequently,  playful  learning  environments  encourage  joyful learning  and  well-being  (Andreopoulou  &amp;  Moustakas  2019).  We  argue that PPBL is also enjoyable because it involves spaces where learners are free to explore and be creative and can experience joy, build relationships and feel good (Leather et al. 2021; Poikela &amp; Poikela 2005). Lynneth Solis et al. (2021) describe the joy experienced in playful learning as teaching and learning experiences that promote excitement, anticipation, happiness,  fun  and  togetherness.  Joyful,  playful  activities  also  offer  a sense of comfort despite being challenging. Activities that foster joyful learning  are  further  associated  with  an  element  of  surprise,  laughter, silliness, and shared creations and discoveries. We believe that notions of silliness,  laughter and joking promote happiness and positive emotions and are paramount to using PPBL to enhance well-being. Playfulness and positive emotions, in turn, promote creativity and motivation, which are critical aspects associated with playfulness and PBL (Leather et al. 2021; Poikela &amp; Poikela 2005).

Positive  emotion (P)  is  a  central  element  in  the  PERMA  (positive emotions,  engagement,  positive  relationships,  meaning  and  achievement/ accomplishment) well-being  theory  (Seligman  2011,  2018),  along  with engagement (E), relationships (R), meaning (M) and achievement (A). However, as discussed in this chapter, engagement, connection, belonging  and  relationships,  meaning  and  authenticity,  achievement, success  and  self-actualisation  are  all  central  components  of  PPBL  as well (Andreopoulou &amp; Moustakas 2019; Baker et al. 2023; Barrett 2005;

Leather et al. 2021; Poikela &amp; Poikela 2005). This latter notion supports our argument that joyful PPBL could also enhance learners' SDL skills and well-being.

## A conceptual framework for self-directed playful problem-based learning to promote joyful learning

As the preamble to the framework proposed in this chapter, we would like to highlight characteristics that underpin authentic and self-directed PPBL  that  emerged  from  our  study.  Social-constructivist  principles inform these characteristics and include that learning must occur within safe spaces, be designed with learner needs in mind, have real-life value, and  provide  opportunities  for  learners  to  build  relationships  and experience  a  sense  of  belonging.  In  addition,  engagement  in  selfdirected  PPBL  activities  will  enable  learners  to  become  intrinsically motivated and self-disciplined, think about and reflect on their thinking (metacognitive  skills) and  have  high levels of self-determination. Moreover, within these PPBL contexts, learners can adjust their learning, monitor their  progress,  and  are  intrinsically  motivated  to  identify,  set and  pursue  their  self-determined  goals  and  objectives.  Furthermore, PPBL activities support learners' ability to self-assess, engage emotionally in the learning process and persevere.

One of the aims of this chapter is to generate a conceptual framework (Figure  4.1)  for  self-directed  PPBL  grounded  in  principles  associated with  SDL  to  promote  joyful  learning.  The  framework  was  developed through thematic analysis (Clarke, Braun &amp; Hayfield 2015) and is informed by the scholarly literature discussed in this chapter. The framework holds that for self-directed PPBL to occur, learning must be contextualised in that learners must have opportunities to learn in a self-directed manner through, with and from others and to actively engage in teaching and learning activities that meet  their individual needs  and  abilities. Furthermore,  teachers  must  create  constructive  SDL  classrooms  and apply  learner-centred  teaching  and  learning  strategies.  Within  these constructive classrooms, learners have SDL opportunities to experience a sense of belonging while being encouraged by self-directed teachers who motivate learners to take ownership of their learning. Finally, we argue  that  self-directed  PPBL  results  from  playful  activities  where learners experience joy while engaging in self-directed PPBL activities that promote authentic learning and hard (challenging) fun. Self-directed PPBL further promotes creative problem-solving, relationship building, self-actualisation,  agency,  intrinsic  and  extrinsic  motivation,  positive emotions and, ultimately, well-being.

## Recommendations for transformed teaching and learning practices

As  this  chapter  concludes,  we  propose  suggestions  for  transformed teaching and learning practices. For joyful learning to occur, we recommend cultivating safe and secure learning environments and inculcating a sense of  community  in  the  learning  settings.  Moreover,  we  recommend  that independent  learning  should  be  encouraged  in  learning  communities (learning environments) while mounting necessary skills, thereby developing autonomous, open-minded  and  self-directed 'owners of

learning'  who  can  recognise  their  own  learning  needs.  We  also  suggest designing  a  classroom  where  learners  discover  their  identities,  learning styles, interests and motivations for acquiring new information. Learners need to pursue their learning with passing and curiosity and to do so while the necessary space for making mistakes is in place. That said, such a space will  allow  learners  to  make  mistakes  without  consequences  as  part  of the learning process. Failure to create such an SDL environment can cripple their ability to take on new learning endeavours. Suppose learners have self-directed PPBL opportunities to experience failure within safe teaching and learning spaces. In that case, they develop skills that foster innovative, creative problem-solving skills essential for them to overcome challenges and develop resilience.

Further,  we  recommend encouraging an attitude of curiosity,  so  that learners can feel free to explore learning. Learners should be given a voice in their classrooms so that their classrooms can become platforms where they feel empowered. Therefore, we recommend that learning activities be of such a nature that they support learners to develop their own voices, which  we  regard  as  much  more  important  than  extrinsic  motivation. Learners  should  also  be  offered  opportunities  to  take  responsibility  for their  learning  and  set  their  own  goals.  Doing  so  can  assist  learners  in discovering themselves in their learning activities and building trust and confidence in their abilities through learning.

A  constructive  and  encouraging  classroom  atmosphere  where  selfdirected PPBL strategies are utilised must show learners how to overcome fear  and  disappointment.  Therefore,  we  argue  that  collaboration  and building  meaningful  relationships  are  key  preconditions  for  learners  to experience  meaningful  learning.  Collaboration  and  building  meaningful relationships are integral to personal development, as relationships promote the development of SDL skills associated with self-actualisation. Through self-directed PPBL and joyful teaching and learning activities, we believe learners can experience hope and improved well-being.

## Conclusion

In  conclusion,  this  chapter  contributes  to  the  body  of  knowledge  by expanding  insights  into  the  theoretical  underpinnings  for  self-directed PPBL as a pedagogical choice for implementing meaningful education. We argue that self-directed PPBL experiences that are hard and joyful could ultimately  be  transformative.  The  framework  suggested  in  this  chapter indicates  that  whenever  learners  have  the  opportunities  to  engage  in authentic  teaching  and  learning  experiences,  where  they  face  real-life problems  and  engage  with  multiple  ways  of  knowing,  they  can,  as  a consequence, experience personal and social transformation. By applying

the  self-directed  PPBL  framework,  teachers  can  foster  teaching  and learning environments that promote an ethic of care, compassion and a sense of belonging. Self-directed PPBL could further be transformative by creating  environments  where  learners  can  create  novel  meanings  when they explore and manipulate various resources and change or adapt their behaviour  based  on  social  negotiation  and  interaction.  Within  these contexts, learners can challenge societal inequality and disrupt established norms  associated  with  subjugation,  otherness  and  exclusion.  Through these  co-constructed,  safe,  joyful  and  self-directed  PPBL  experiences, learners can feel valued, cared for and belong, enabling them to reach their full potential and flourish. Thus, learners who discover the joy of learning can make a signification contribution to their communities.

## Abstract

There  is  a  worldwide  emphasis  on  computational  thinking  (CT)  as  an essential skill for the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR). The notion of CT involves  various  thought  processes  associated  with  solving  real-world problems based on the attributes of computer science. This chapter deals with the active involvement of mathematics students in game-based tasks with the aim of developing CT skills. A general qualitative research approach was followed. One cohort of 61 second-year Bachelor of Education (BEd) students  registered  for  the  Intermediate  Phase  (Intersen)  module  in mathematics and collaborated in groups of five-six members. They had to

design a game based on a mathematical topic to introduce students to the topic. This was followed by activities where they had to solve mathematics problems using the visual Scratch (n.d.) 2 programming environment. Data collection comprised two coding tasks. This was followed by the completion of  individual  reflective  questions.  It  was  evident  from  the  qualitative findings that students developed some CT abilities. We also posed some recommendations for teacher education.

## Introduction

An  increasing  focus  on  digital  competencies  requires  students  to  be prepared for the challenges ahead, and specifically to develop skills for the 4IR. One such competence is the notion of CT, as suggested in the seminal work of Jeanette Wing (2006).

Computational thinking emphasises approaches and thought processes associated with solving real-world problems based on computer science attributes. Relkin, De Ruiter and Bers (2021, p. 2) refer to CT as 'a set of heuristic reasoning skills that can be categorised into discrete sub-domains applicable to problem-solving in computer science and other disciplines'. Computational  thinking  as  a  cross-disciplinary  skill  involves  computer science  fundamentals,  requires  high-level  thinking  and  prioritises  social interaction  in  authentic  tasks  to  solve  intriguing  real-world  problems (Hava &amp; Ünlü 2021; Korkmaz, Çakir &amp; Özden 2017). Several scholars assign the following core attributes to CT, namely the ability to:

- · simplify complex problems (abstraction)
- · use stepwise (particular steps) and algorithmic thinking
- · break  down  a  problem  into  convenient  and  manageable  elements (decomposition)
- · identify similarities and differences between patterns (pattern recognition) to make sense thereof and solve such a problem (Grover &amp; Pea 2018; Wing 2006).

In  other  words,  CT  is  a  way  of  conceptualising  and  solving  real-world problems typical to humankind (Hsu, Chang &amp; Hung 2018).

The acquisition of CT is of importance in education. Umutlu (2021, p. 1) states, 'CT should be one of the skills emphasised in 21st-century classes as students […] are needed to solve contemporary complex problems'. Czerkawski and Lyman (2015) explored CT in higher education (HE) and referred  to  its  application  in  cross-disciplinary  fields,  such  as  physics, statistics,  bioinformatics  and  archaeology.  Moreover,  Hsu  et  al.  (2018)

investigated how CT should be taught and learnt and emphasised that the  core  of  implementing  CT  is  knowledgeable  teachers  who  have  to scaffold learners in this regard. However, studies suggest that pre-service teachers require extended exposure to develop a profound understanding of CT and enhance efficiency (Butler &amp; Leahy 2021). It is therefore essential to prepare pre-service students to develop CT skills themselves to support learners in addressing open-ended problems. Computational thinking can also be implemented as part of pedagogy of play (PoP) (see ch. 2) and game-based tasks where the emphasis is on learner-student engagement in playful activities and collaborative problem-solving to develop distinctive  future  skills  (Czerkawski  &amp;  Lyman  2015;  Tsarava,  Moeller  &amp; Ninaus 2018).

To give a more nuanced understanding of CT in teacher education, this chapter aims to report how mathematics students developed CT in gamebased  tasks.  The  following  research  questions,  therefore,  guided  this research study:

- 1. Which  opportunities  are  involved  in  game-based  tasks  to  support student collaboration?
- 2.  How do mathematics students develop CT in game-based tasks?
- 3.  Which  affordances  does  CT  provide  towards  students'  self-directed learning (SDL)?

## Context and related work

Some aspects related to CT are outlined in this section.

## Constructionist view

Computational  thinking  is  based  on  the  constructionist  view,  where learning is promoted when learners are actively involved in knowledge construction (Butler &amp; Leahy 2021). Seymour Papert developed the  constructionist  approach,  which  is  grounded  in  the  tenet  that knowledge  is  constructed  where  learners  engage  in  social  interaction (Papert 1980). Papert (1980, p. 4) asserts that programmable objects will influence the lives of learners in such a way that they develop ideas, 'form new relationships with knowledge' and construct new meaning. Papert developed  the  LOGO  graphical  environment  -  using  commands  that control a metaphoric turtle - to facilitate people in learning programming and playing games where strategic thinking is required (Benelhardi et al.) (see ch. 7). Papert (1980, p. 21) also emphasises that such engagement can provide for learning that becomes 'active and self-directed'.

## Development of computational thinking

Concerning problems related to the computer science domain, Czerkawski and Lyman (2015, p. 58) argue that some are 'computable' while others are 'non-computable' (e.g. infinite execution). Yildiz Durak (2020) highlights the importance of high-order thinking, detailed knowledge and an effective coding process to address such problems. As far as CT is concerned, it involves a particular way of thinking based on computer science principles regarding approaching and solving a problem with no obvious solution. The key aspects of CT involve abstractions of complex problems, algorithmic thinking,  as  well  as  the  identification  of  similarities  between  problems (pattern  matching)  and  the  breaking  down  of  an  intricate  problem  into reducible parts (Grover &amp; Pea 2018; Wing 2006). Wing (2006, pp. 2, 3) also refers  to  essential  abilities,  such  as  'reformulation  […]  recursion  […] reduction, embedding, transformation, or simulation [and] backtracking' when addressing open-ended problems. Computational thinking is therefore  considered  a  specific  way  of  approaching  and  solving  a  realworld problem by applying powerful strategies associated with computer science.  Based  on  what  CT  entails  (Wing  2006,  pp.  1-4),  it  is  worth considering the following integrated goals as displayed in Figure 5.1:

- · Goal  1: To develop  a  personal  mindset comprising  essential  and fundamental thinking skills (e.g. concepts, ideas, abstractions, reasoning, judgement,  estimation  and  reformulation,  high-order  thinking  and

systems  thinking,  modelling,  reflective  thinking,  correction,  reliability and  optimisation)  on  how  to  solve  puzzling  real-world  problems  by applying the principles of computer science.

- · Goal 2: To prioritise interpersonal and social interaction and empower people  to  address  computational  problems  jointly  in  responsible, innovative and creative ways.
- · Goal 3: T o integrate  and  complement cross-disciplinary thinking with the aim of solving problems in novel ways and developing a profound understanding thereof.
- · Goal  4: To apply  such  thinking  on  different  levels ,  platforms,  virtual worlds, repositories, hybrid spaces and problem-based environments to benefit a digital society.

The goals mentioned here are also aligned with the competencies referred to by Pala and Mıhcı Türker (2021), as the authors concur with the International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE) in terms of empowering learning, constructing  knowledge,  being  innovative  and  communicating  inspired ideas,  being  a  digital  citizen,  thinking  computationally  and  being  able  to work together with other people.

The question follows whether CT can be learnt and, if so, which skills and supportive strategies are essential for meaningful learning? Scholars mention there is uncertainty about developing CT skills in the classroom and employing supportive thinking strategies (Pala &amp; Mıhcı Türker 2021). Umutlu (2021) mentions that several attempts have been made to integrate CT into the classroom. Unfortunately, teachers do not necessarily have the necessary knowledge about computer science or the relevant professional support  and  pedagogical  knowledge,  and  they  experience  a  lack  of collaboration  with  teachers  who  are  knowledgeable  about  computer science (Umutlu 2021).

Computational thinking is a challenge for some teachers. For example, mathematics teachers are used to solving problems in a certain way by applying a formula. Such an approach can limit their thinking and reasoning when solving real-world problems (Hsu et al. 2018). Mathematics requires several ways of thinking, and it enables people to make sense of the world, investigate phenomena, make deductions, prove certain properties, gather data  and  make  measurements  and  implement  mathematical  models (Schoenfeld 2016). Nevertheless, Wing (2006, p. 3) emphasises that CT involves  the  ability  to  'think  computationally,  not  just  mathematically'. Consequently, CT is a crucial competence in various domains, and teachers have to plan and provide opportunities for the learning and application thereof (Hsu et al. 2018). Several scholars highlight using block-based tools and teaching-learning strategies to assist in developing CT skills (Brennan &amp; Resnick 2012; Hsu et al. 2018; Relkin et al. 2021; Umutlu 2021).

## Block-based tools to develop computational thinking

Whether tools are digital (software) or physical (tangible objects), they can be used for meaningful learning and knowledge construction (Dhakulkar &amp; Olivier 2021). Some examples of block-based tools and free software that may assist in the development of CT are Scratch (Relkin et al. 2021) and micro:bit (Shahin et al. 2022).

## Scratch programming environment and repository

Scratch is an  online  visual  programming  environment  that  can  be downloaded  freely.  The  integrated  development  environment  (IDE) comprises  visually  coloured  block-based  codes  (the  block  palette  on the  left  in  Figure  5.2)  that  are  used  to  give  instructions  (scripts)  and

control sprites. A sprite (the cat on the right in Figure 5.2) is an object that executes the programming instructions or codes. Sprites can move and interact with one another. This IDE enables students to create their own  animations  and  games,  and  additional  functionality  involves  an introduction to the foundations of electronics.

## BBC micro:bit

The micro:bit was  developed  in  the  United  Kingdom  (UK)  to  provide opportunities for learners to become involved in programming and basic electronics. The micro:bit is a small computer (smaller than a credit card) that  comprises  two  buttons,  sensors  and  a  light-emitting  diode  (LED) display for output. Programming output can be done with the IDE simulation (Figure 5.3) (using Microsoft MakeCode - a free online platform) or on the small physical micro:bit board (Figure 5.3).

## eaching-learning strategies to promote T computational thinking

Diversified  teaching-learning  strategies  can  be  used  to  assist  in  the development  of  CT  skills.  Hsu  et  al.  (2018)  mention  student-centred strategies  relevant  to  CT:  Problem-based  learning  (PBL),  cooperative learning (CL), game-based learning (GBL), project-based learning, designbased  learning,  storytelling,  scaffolding  and  embodied  learning.  Such strategies pave the way for group work and social interaction while solving a problem. Hadad et al. (2021) also mention prominent strategies, such as tinkering and debugging, experiential learning and collaborative learning for  developing  CT  skills.  Although  PBL,  based  on  a  challenge,  directs students' activities, we  employed  GBL  to  provide  instances  where mathematics students could develop CT skills.

## Game-based learning

The  teaching  and  learning  of  CT  can  be  supported  by  employing  playbased strategies and GBL (see ch. 2). Czerkawski and Lyman (2015, p. 60) emphasise that GBL should be considered an 'effective strategy' to develop essential CT skills because it supports understanding programming aspects and  reasoning  in  a  joyful  and  visual  environment.  Tsarava  et  al.  (2018) implemented  GBL  focusing  on  the  key  concepts  of  CT  by  employing unplugged board games. They emphasise that GBL motivates learners to interact with each other and aim to develop programming skills, such as iteration and patterns; mathematics skills, such as spatial orientation and angular  degrees;  as  well  as  skills  related  both  to  programming  and mathematics (e.g.  variables  and  operators)  (Tsarava  et  al.  2018).  Turchi, Fogli  and  Malizia  (2019)  focused  on  group  collaboration  and  students' involvement in GBL with the aim of improving CT abilities. Their results indicate that games and a playful learning environment are conducive to developing students' CT skills using group activities.

## Computational thinking and self-directed learning

Development of CT requires abilities such as reflective thinking and SDL (Threekunprapa &amp; Yasri 2020). Students must select relevant resources, develop  fundamental  skills  instead  of  rote  learning,  evaluate  possible solutions and develop a deep understanding (Wing 2006). The essence of SDL is the ability of individuals to be independent and responsible, manage their own learning processes, make decisions about how to approach and solve problems and be persistent in solving them. Threekunprapa and Yasri (2020)  argue  that  passive  learning  and  remembering  will  demotivate

learners, whereas active learning and task engagement motivate learners. They propose a 3S SDL method to promote the development of CT skills in secondary learners, namely self-checking (in pairs), self-debugging (in pairs) and scaffolding (teacher) (Threekunprapa &amp; Yasri 2020, p. 1025). Hadad et al. (2021) studied teachers' professional development in an online coding and robotics course - using Scratch - with the aim of developing their CT skills. They used synchronous sessions and asynchronous activities during  the  coronavirus  disease  2019  (COVID-19)  pandemic  lockdown restrictions. To enhance independent and responsible learning, Hadad et al. (2021,  p.  786)  highlight  'teachers  must  experience  SDL  themselves'  to develop CT competencies. Yildiz Durak (2020) studied secondary school learners' engagement, reflective thinking and CT when doing programming tasks.  The  findings  indicate  that Scratch provided  for  developing  SDL abilities  and  increased  learners'  motivation.  Consequently,  SDL  abilities, such as persistence, initiative and responsibility in learning, curiosity and the development of a plan (Guglielmino 2013), are valuable and supportive in promoting meaningful CT skills.

## Research methodology

Although the current research forms part of a project that employed a mixed-method approach, this chapter is concerned with the phase that used a qualitative methodology. The qualitative phase involved mathematics students' interaction and collaboration, their experiences and skill development in game-based tasks.

## Participants and research ethics

In total, 61 second-year students registered for a module in mathematics participated. They were Afrikaansand English-speaking residential students who were required to collaborate online because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The co-author, who was also the lecturer, randomly assigned the students in groups at the beginning of the semester. There were twelve groups with about five-six members per group. Each group chose a leader who had the following responsibilities:

- · To ensure that all members actively participate and stay on track.
- · To schedule the Microsoft (MS) Teams or Zoom meetings.
- · To communicate with members on their WhatsApp group.
- · To complete and submit the group assignment before the due date.

Ethical clearance was obtained from the North-West University's (NWU) Faculty  of  Education,  South  Africa.  The  research  only  involved  willing participants who provided informed consent.

## Context and student activities

Participants  had  no  previous  exposure  to  the Scratch programming environment, coding or CT. As part of the preparation, students therefore had to read an article about CT and had to watch three YouTube videos on the Scratch visual programming environment as well as some videos about teaching learners and students how to code. The purpose of the assignment was to integrate  CT  as  part  of  students'  teaching-learning  practices  by linking it with the Department of Basic Education's (DBE) Curriculum and Assessment  Policy  Statement (CAPS)  for  Intermediate  Phase  (Intersen) mathematics. The assignment comprised the following activities:

- 1. Students had to compile a game based on a specific mathematics topic (see details, Activity 1).
- 2.  Students had to do two programming tasks (A and B) where the Scratch sprite had to sketch certain geometric shapes according to the execution of the block-based code.
- 3.  An  MS  Teams  meeting  had  to  be  held  to  reflect  on  their  thought processes and optimise the coding.
- 4.  An  MS  PowerPoint  presentation  had  to  be  compiled  by  the  group regarding  their  roles  (number  2),  an  overview  of  their  programming tasks and suggestions to improve the assignment.
- 5.  Individual completion of reflective questions on Google Forms.

## Activity 1: Mathematics and computational thinking

Students had to create a cost-effective activity for Grades 4-6 learners to link CT with a specific mathematics topic. For example, students had to specify which aspects or features of CT they had used and why and how their activity was linked to a specific mathematics topic. They also had to explain  how  they  would  provide  learners  with  opportunities  to  develop such thinking. This activity aimed to develop a better number sense and employ strategies to formulate and solve the problem. The groups created a variety of activities, such as movement and position, creating patterns with sticks and bottle tops, multiplying whole numbers, applying pattern recognition using dominoes and solving algebraic equations according to the order of operations.

The 'Among Us' tour (Group 04, 29 November 2021) was an example of GBL,  where  CT  was  applied.  Students  compiled  the  activity  involving knowledge of the Grade 6 mathematics CAPS curriculum (Term 4), which deals with space and shapes (geometry), position and movement. Graphs and calculations are also introduced. The compiled activity is as follows: Learners work in groups and receive a copy of a map (board with a floor plan), a route-recording sheet and an image of an object (person).

The  object  must  move  around  the  board,  start  at  a  certain  position (entrance), visit all the other positions (rooms) only once and finally return to the entrance, completing the route in no more than twelve moves. Each move should be recorded on the recording sheet. Learners must be actively involved, apply CT and reflective and critical thinking to determine the best route, and then evaluate the solution.

## Coding tasks using Scratch : Task A

The  first coding  task  introduced  students  to Scratch and  entailed drawing  the  decagram  (10-point  star  polygon)  using  the  block-based codes. They had to use, among others, the repeat, move and turn instructions to create the polygon. To achieve this, the students had to think about and determine the exterior angle to ensure the polygon was drawn correctly. Furthermore,  they  had  to  copy  five  Scratch  block  code  images  with matching Scratch output (program execution) sequentially to indicate their thinking behind each drawing and their written reflections and suggestions in case the picture needed improvement.

## Coding tasks using Scratch : Task B

Students had to formulate their own GBL challenge on a specific mathematics topic for learners. They had to plan their own diagram(s) to be executed by the sprite. Group members also had to include five Scratch images of block code with related output sequentially to indicate their thinking. The aim was to develop an activity for learners in Scratch where they can do programming in a play-based environment and develop CT skills. Creating their own game also needed high-order thinking skills (HoTS).

## Activities 3-5: MS Teams meeting, MS PowerPoint presentation and reflections

Participating  students  engaged  in  the  activities  as  mentioned  earlier  in three ways. Firstly, each of the twelve groups held an MS Teams meeting in which they reflected on their thinking processes and made suggestions on how to improve the tasks. They had to record their meeting and submit it  as  a  six-  to  eight-minute video. Secondly, each group prepared an MS PowerPoint  presentation  to  reflect  on  their  group  collaboration  and responsibilities.  Finally,  the  students  concluded  with  reflective  questions on the coding tasks. The researcher planned twelve open-ended questions on a Google Form that the students had to complete individually. These questions  focused  on  students'  feelings,  online  collaboration  and  group work,  challenges  and  successes.  A  total  of  43  students  completed  the individual reflective questions based on the coding tasks.

## Assessment of computational thinking tasks

The final assignment of the semester focused on CT, which contributed to students' module marks. The lecturer (co-author) assessed each activity using a rubric, as shown in Table 5.1, which displays the assessment criteria for Tasks A and B.

## Data collection and analysis

The following data were collected as part of the assignment:

- · Own mathematics game
- · Scratch programming Tasks A and B
- · Video of each group's MS Teams meeting and their reflections
- · MS PowerPoint presentation
- · Each student's completion of the twelve reflective questions on Google Forms.

The  researchers  employed in  vivo coding  (also  known  as  'verbatim coding') to indicate students' actual words and phrases regarding their

## Discussion

In  this  section,  the  research  questions  are  answered.  The  first  question aimed  to  determine  the  opportunities  that  are  involved  in  game-based tasks to support student collaboration.

Students  had  both  positive  and  negative  experiences  regarding  their group activities and collaboration in game-based tasks. Most members were not used to programming, and the Scratch IDE was unknown to them. They addressed the challenge by watching relevant videos on Scratch , structuring their  learning  environment  (WhatsApp  and  Telegram  social  networking applications, MS Teams meetings), setting reminders and deadlines according to a time frame and allowing for good communication between them.

cooperation (Johnson &amp; Johnson 2018; Korkmaz et al. 2017), where members are actively involved and choose specific roles. Students did considerable research, brainstormed, assisted each other and selected the best solution. In  addition,  group  members  monitored  their  progress  and  used  Google Forms to share suggestions, reflect on their thinking and conduct random member checks. One student noted, 'This is not our first assignment as a group; we grew together and overcame challenges' (see Table 5.3). Members were also positive that they would succeed and submit a good assignment. Unfortunately, some groups experienced threats, such as excuses for not completing  activities  and  postponement  of  individual  tasks.  Language differences were further issues, and sometimes technology was a limitation when students worked online during COVID-19. As a result, most students experienced GBL as positive, as it provided for developing new knowledge, enhanced each other's learning and supported their strengths as a group. Results indicated that games and a playful learning environment develop students' CT skills through group activities. The findings are aligned with Tsarava et al. (2018), who claim that GBL motivates learners to interact with each other and to develop essential programming skills.

The second research question investigated how mathematics students developed CT in game-based tasks. Students were actively involved and

employed creative ways to design a game based on a mathematics topic. At first, students experienced feelings of despair, anxiety and stress. It was a challenging task for students to 'think computationally, not just mathematically' (Wing 2006, p. 3). Despite these feelings, they became more confident and motivated as they progressed. Students' collaboration showed their initial planning, monitoring and reflection on their progress and  the  resources  used.  When  drawing  the  10-point  star  polygon  and constructing  their  own  programming  activity,  members  had  to  apply algorithmic thinking, integrate the relevant coding blocks and produce the required  output.  Appropriate  planning  and  design  were  essential.  Some examples were a spiral with different colours, degrees and pen sizes and a diagram with 'three perpendicular sides attached to each other, turning 18° each time and which is repeated five times' (see Table 5.4).

A few examples of abstraction and decomposition were mentioned. An example is the 'Among Us' tour game (Group 4), where students would expect learners to study the route, position and movement, decide which path to follow and how to convey the directions and choose the best route. It was essential to focus on the relevant requirements and break down the problem into smaller parts to solve it. Regarding the coding of Tasks, A and B, one of the groups made some mistakes, such as the sprite walking too short a distance or having it turn in the wrong direction. However, they could  reflect  on  their  thinking  and  accomplish  the  task.  Some  students changed the coding until they found the right angles to perfect the shape. Unfortunately, such an approach could indicate a trial-and-error strategy as it involves several attempts until students find the correct angles for the sprite to execute.

One example of pattern recognition emerged in Activity 1, where Group 4 constructed a task using plastic straws and glue and requested Intermediate Phase learners to apply the correct rule regarding the order of mathematical operators: Bracket , order , division , multiplication , addition and subtraction (BODMAS) in solving a problem (Figure 5.4).

Another example using patterns was the following (see Table 5.4):

'The Scratch program is a very creative way to teach learners the calculation of degrees and the lengths of a line on a graph […] and interesting way to learn patterns and directions. Each step the learners take will show the problem and solution of the previous steps.' (Students, genders undisclosed, 29 November 2021)

Regarding the goals of CT (see 'Development of computational thinking'), students  applied  some  ideas  ( personal  mindset )  to  create  and  solve  a problem,  engaged  in  online social  interaction to  solve  problems  jointly, complemented mathematical  thinking  with  CT  and applied these  in  a

game-based  task  as  based  on  Wing's  view  of  CT  (Wing  2006).  These examples also related to the four integrated goals of CT, as mentioned by the authors and shown in Figure 5.1.

The  third  question  explored  which  affordances  CT  provides  towards students'  SDL.  Completing  the  CT  assignment  was  challenging  for  the students.  Participating  students  mentioned  several  examples  of  selfdirected abilities: For example, they identified some learning gaps. Even though mathematics students had no experience with the Scratch IDE or coding, they shared some ideas and assisted each other in participating in the challenge and learning new skills. Initially, some students struggled and 'figure[d] it out'; while others were confident to take up the challenge: 'I am full of confidence and grateful for my group' (see Table 5.5). In addition, students struggled with the coding, and some used several attempts to solve  the  problem  while  others  were  'off  target'.  Nevertheless,  they persisted, reflected on their thinking and corrected mistakes.

Participating  students  were  curious  and  learnt  how  to  program  and create shapes by integrating different colours, pen sizes, angles and sounds. Although they had individual responsibilities, everyone assisted, discussed the issues and allowed members to choose different sections according to their strengths. One participant mentioned, 'I will […] put in more effort to ensure that it is of good quality', while another used a checklist to reflect on her learning and to ensure that all requirements had been addressed.

Group work was essential, and students learnt programming in Scratch , executed their plans, searched for relevant information, identified the best solution and developed a profound understanding of CT and mathematics. This  notion  is  supported  by  Turchi  et  al.  (2019),  who  focused  on  group collaboration and students' involvement in GBL to promote CT abilities. Furthermore,  some  affordances  related  to  CT  were  the  development  of several SDL skills. In this regard, Threekunprapa and Yasri (2020) emphasise that  CT  requires  reflective  thinking  and  SDL  abilities  to  succeed  in challenging tasks. This was evident from students' motivation to learn, their initiative and the management of their learning processes, and their  persistence in addressing programming challenges and developing their own games.

## Recommendations and limitations

Recommendations to improve the future quality of CT tasks include the following:

- · An introductory lesson and practical activities in Scratch prior  to  the assignment.
- · Specific  guidelines  on  students'  collaboration  and  interaction  and reporting of non-collaborating students.
- · Face-to-face classrooms could provide more opportunities and strengthen student engagement in GBL.

One of the limitations of this study is that the research cannot be generalised, as a small number of students participated. Moreover, the GBL tasks were done where students mainly worked online, and some experienced technical challenges.

## Conclusion

This  chapter  aimed  to  explore  mathematics  education  students'  active involvement in game-based tasks to provide opportunities for developing CT  skills.  Findings  indicate  that  students  developed  some  CT  skills, collaboration and self-directed abilities. Future research on the development of  CT,  the  effects  of  a  face-to-face  environment,  suitable  game-based teaching-learning strategies and the effect on SDL is recommended.

## Abstract

Geometry as a subject remains a challenge for most learners from primary school onwards. Indeed, numerous difficulties arise in learners' learning, such as a lack of motivation, a lack of abstraction and the discontinuity between theoretical and concrete concepts, which directly influence the attractiveness of mathematics courses in general and geometry in particular. To  motivate  students  to  develop  their  abstractions  and  concretise  their knowledge  in  geometry  for  self-directed  learning  (SDL),  we  developed problem-based  pedagogical  sequences  in  coding  based  on  the  LOGO language  pedagogical  environment  in  education.  An  experiment  was conducted with an experimental group from the secondary high school level. They were introduced to the visual environment that facilitates the creation  of  geometric  shapes  within  the  context  of  pedagogies  of  play (PoPs) and SDL. A control group of 20 students also did the same exercises but followed a more classical approach. At the end of the experiment, both groups' results were compared. The results show that the learners' yield in the experiment using coding was better than that of the classical approach. This  problem-based  learning  (PBL)  and  computational  thinking  (CT) approach  -  infused  with  elements  of  play  pedagogies  -  was  deemed successful. Moreover, fostering SDL via coding can be optimised through learner involvement, leading to improvements in their abstractions, which finally develops their mathematical skills.

## Introduction

The current trend in education systems worldwide is introducing computer coding in the classroom (Ouahbi et al. 2017). Several governments, such as Bulgaria,  Cyprus,  Denmark,  England,  Estonia,  Greece,  Ireland,  Poland, Portugal and South Africa, have already or are considering including coding

in  their  school  educational  curricula.  Coding  integration  allows  crosscurricular  skills  development  in  learners,  particularly  CT  (Yildiz  Durak 2020).  Wing  (2006,  p.  33)  defines  CT  as  'a  skill  that  involves  solving problems,  designing  systems,  and  understanding  human  behavior,  by pressing  the  fundamental  concepts  of  computer  science'.  Hence,  this chapter  aims  to  explore  the  possibilities  for  CT  in  geometry  through  a LOGO PBL experience fostering SDL with high school learners in Morocco.

Within  this  context,  PBL  was  viewed  as  a  process  in  which  students follow triggers based on a specific problem or scenario, after which they determine their own learning objectives (Wood 2003). Furthermore, as we consider PBL supportive of fostering SDL, it is essential also to define the parameters of what is understood as SDL. We regard SDL - as defined by Knowles (1975, p. 18) and as mentioned in Chapter 1.

Within this context, this research specifically focused on CT in terms of PBL for SDL. Computational thinking is not exclusively relevant to computer science  as  a  subject  but  can  also  be  regarded  as  a  competence  (Hsu, Chang  &amp;  Hung  2018).  Research  has  shown  that  coding  can  be  a  good mechanism for developing this skill. The machine is essentially an entity that can speak mathematics, and learning to speak with the computer (i.e. coding) can prove to be one of the most 'natural' ways of doing mathematics (Papert 1981). Conversely, the view of Dijkstra (1970) is that programming is indeed not a form of mathematics but rather science. The machine always responds to the question posed to it - it is for the user to penetrate the logic to be able to use its power better; this learning supposes a decentration between our thought system and its operating system (Mendelsohn 1985). In short, the machine can only reflect and concretise human thought to the computer, which may seem boring and repetitive but can also be considered ingenious and imaginative to people, according to Wing (2006).

Using coding through LOGO is quite appropriate within the context of PBL  for  SDL  and  allows  for  learning  through  play  and  research  to  be conducted. A typical situation could be as follows: The student receives a drawing they must reproduce using the 'turtle' in the software. It could be a  figurative  drawing,  an  attractive  motif,  a  frieze  or  a  fractal.  Seymour Papert's objectives in developing the LOGO  language  go  beyond mathematics  education.  Experience  has  shown  that  most  students  are happy to engage in this type of activity, in which they have the freedom to experiment, solve problems and do without the teacher to evaluate them. This brings an element of play into the classroom, as was shown in earlier research on using LOGO (Shier 1991; Silvern 1988) and contributes towards building a play-based pedagogy (see ch. 2) (Lunga, Esterhuizen &amp; Koen 2022; Miller &amp; Saenz 2021; Pyle &amp; Danniels 2017).

Results  of  a  classroom  experiment  in  CM2  (in  French cours  moyen  2 , Grade 2 primary school level) in France show that learners have greater success with LOGO compared to learners in the traditional environment, with  a  significant  difference  (50%  and  40%)  for  the  two  years,  for  the diagonal of a square ( □ ), and fairly significant success (27% and 17%) for the two exercises of reproductions of hexagonal ( ⬡ ) and pentagonal ( ⬠ ) rosettes (Gobert 1992). In these activities, learners develop and construct knowledge  about  an  object.  The  LOGO  social  networking  activity  in  a learning  environment  in  practice  intervenes  as  a  different  and  complementary way of approaching a notion or a theme of geometry (Gobert 1992). On the other hand, for Piaget - regarded as the founder of constructivist theory thought develops in the same way. Constructivist theory, followed by many pedagogues, didactics  and  psychologists,  was  evoked  not  only  to  have discourse on learning but also observation of the processes implemented by the subject who is confronted with resolving a problem (Servant-Miklos 2019).  With  our  research,  the  learner  can  approach  a  large  part  of  the concepts of classical geometry, including angles, symmetry and polygons. Learners actively participate in discovering the theorems and properties of the figures they construct (Mendelsohn 1985).

Our work combines the computational approach, neo-papertism and the  constructivism  of  Piaget  in  a  mathematical  problem  related  to constructing  a  geometric  figure.  The  decomposition  of  a  problem  into small  parts  or  subprocedures  and  the  abstraction,  generalisation  and elaboration of sequences and solutions tracks, also noted as 'algorithms', lead to organising own knowledge and building new tools through play.

Our goal in this chapter was to study the extent of CT through LOGO coding employing PBL for SDL in mathematics. We also explored whether using this tool in class studying geometry could positively impact the level of abstraction of learners and the development and construction of other skills related to problem-solving.

## Background and issues

## Learners and mathematics

Learner motivation in terms of learning mathematical skills is highly relevant to  this  research.  Similarly,  when  approaching  SDL,  the  importance  of motivation  extends  beyond  just  the  subject  of  mathematics,  as  Randy Garrison  identified  this  aspect  as  one  of  the  dimensions  of  SDL.  In  this context, Garrison (1997) distinguishes between motivation, selfmanagement and self-monitoring as dimensions of SDL. He states explicitly that motivation 'plays a very significant role in the initiation and maintenance

of effort toward learning and the achievement of cognitive goals' (Garrison 1997, p. 26). Consequently, learners' motivation would influence not only their SDL but also their progress in mathematics and, ultimately, also CT.

According  to  the  results  of  the  2012  Programme  for  International Student Assessment (PISA) (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development [OECD] 2016a), learners often show evidence of mathematics anxiety  and  lack  of  motivation,  but  this  varies  between  countries  and contexts.  In  some  countries  -  including  Belgium,  Korea,  Spain,  Finland, France, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, the Netherlands, Portugal and Serbia - less than  half  of  students  who  say  they  are  interested  in  what  they  learn  in mathematics  eagerly  await  their  mathematics  classes  (OECD  2016a). Intrinsic motivation tends to diminish gradually; students are less interested in mathematics and take less pleasure in their studies.

This study's results were confirmed in 2015 (OECD 2016b), which showed that learners in developing countries experienced the highest anxiety levels in  learning  mathematics  obtained  fewer  satisfactory  results.  The  worstperforming countries in mathematics were those with a score of less than 400 points in the PISA events. Conversely, learners in countries above the OECD average -including Germany, Austria, Denmark, Finland, Liechtenstein, the Netherlands and Switzerland - tend to experience the lowest  anxiety  levels  towards  learning  mathematics.  In  fact,  Morocco  unlike  Algeria  and  Tunisia,  Jordan,  Qatar  and  the  United  Arab  Emirates (UAE) - was absent from the PISA 2015 edition (OECD 2016b). The survey published by the OECD is based on data collected in 2015. Tunisia and Algeria, the only Maghreb countries (region of North Africa bordering the Mediterranean Sea) that participated in this ranking, obtained 65th and 69th place, respectively. The best performances were recorded in Singapore, Japan and Estonia. PISA significantly relates to an international assessment of specific skills and knowledge of fifteen-year-old learners, which covers three areas: Reading, science and mathematics. The evaluation of the last edition in which Morocco participated was entirely computer-based.

Attitudes towards mathematics allow explaining (at least in part) the mathematical  skills  of  learners  (Dowker  et  al.  2019;  Winarso  2018). Multiple regression shows that intrinsic motivation, instrumental motivation and anxiety of learners can predict performance in  mathematics  (Ouellette  2013).  This  does  not  surprise  us  as  much  motivation is the main engine of any learning process (Mitchelmore &amp; White  2007),  whereas  anxiety  threatens  the  smooth  running  of  this process. In this context, a learner-centred approach is also envisaged. Then again, generalisation is,  like  abstraction,  a  necessary  process  for building  mathematical  knowledge  and  therefore  plays  a  fundamental

role in learning the reasoning articulated with geometric figures (Richard 2004). In addition, these are the main components of geometric thinking we aim to develop in learners. Abstractions can arise from learning in diverse ways, including familiarising learners to find relevant contexts, recognising  the  commonalities  between  contexts  and  encouraging learners to feel the same thing so that they potentially then form some universal concept which can then be applied in new situations that may arise (Mitchelmore &amp; White 2007).

Abstraction  is  one  of  the  concepts  of  CT  (Wing  2006)  (see  ch.  5). Computational thinking could be considered as both a cognitive tool in which the learner's commitment necessarily involves developing a different relationship to error - especially during a coding process and a problemsolving process - and an essential skill, a combination of algorithms and logical-mathematical reasoning, a complex construct. Thus, coding is a skill that  allows  not  only  immediate  feedback  but  also  an  opportunity  to hypothesise, anticipate and reflect using logico-mathematical relationships (DeBlois  2016)  and,  by  implication,  employ  higher-order  thinking  skills (HoTS)  (Popat  &amp;  Starkey  2019).  Therefore,  it  seems  important  that educational  systems  give  learners  an  intrinsic  and  extrinsic  interest  in mathematics.  Importantly,  mathematics  anxiety  could  be  reduced  by investing in tools and their pedagogical reports (Adihou 2011).

According to the Singapore method of mathematics education, which involves  problem-solving  through  figures  as  well  as  diagrams  (Juarez Eugenio &amp; Aguilar 2018), it is our brains that create the images that we see in reality: the passage from the abstract to the concrete through the image vice versa is the most difficult way to solve a problem, to reason, break it down, reformulate it, model it, and to execute procedures and algorithms (Modeste 2012).

This  research  was  carried  out  given  the  acute  lack  of  this  type  of research,  which  aims  to  introduce  CT  and  coding  into  mathematics education within the identified context. We proposed to think about these questions  simultaneously  following  a  short  activity  involving  a  coding activity in the course of geometry. This work assumes that coding learning could  enhance  the  ability  to  solve  problems.  The  research  questions posed were:

- · Could  this  type  of  LOGO  coding  influence  the  learning  of  problemsolving in mathematics, especially in geometric construction?
- · How can problem-solving  skills  in  geometry  be  developed  using  the LOGO coding environment?
- · How can  playful  LOGO  coding  be  used  as  an  approach  to  motivate learners?
- · How can playful LOGO coding contribute to fostering SDL?

## Choice of language

Why did we choose the LOGO language? For the experiment to be feasible, the software used had to meet certain essential criteria.

The LOGO language generally met the listed criteria. Wally Feurzeig, Cynthia Solomon, and Seymour Papert developed LOGO in 1967 (LOGO Foundation 2015). This  coding  language  aimed  to  allow  children  to  use computers to simulate, build, draw and create - essentially learning through play. This language was part of a project drawing on the work of Piaget and involved combining cognitivist views in terms of artificial intelligence (AI) and  learning  theories  explored  by  Marvin  Minsky  and  Seymour  Papert at the Artificial Intelligence and Computer  Science Laboratory of Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) (Minsky &amp; Papert 1972). Minsky and Papert have even developed a 'social theory of the mind' that defends the  general  idea  that  any  system  is  based  on  relatively  independent subsystems.

According to Papert, LOGO plays three roles simultaneously: A coding language ,  a theory of learning and a material device (Mendelsohn 1985). The limitations of the LOGO environment in computer literacy were related to a lack of autonomy (Resnick et al. 1996). Compared to other programming approaches, the specificity of the LOGO approach is that the latter has been characterised as part of pedagogical robotics. In this environment, coding  learning  is  done  by  playing  games  focused  on  problem-solving (Nijimbere  2014).  Since  the  original  launch  of  LOGO,  this  language  has been extended to other online iterations, such as TurtleBlocks and NetLogo (Dhakulkar &amp; Olivier 2021).

## Coding by LOGO: Learning in a fun way and initiating computational thinking through problem-based learning

In  this  environment,  learning  is  done  playfully  by  playing  and  coding simultaneously, which reduces anxiety and encourages learners to engage in the learning process. The immediate perception of the consequences of using  commands allows learners  to  appropriate  the  syntax  of  language gently.  As  a  counterpoint,  using  LOGO  provides  a  unique  way  through which  language  can  be  utilised  in  determining  commands  and  this, according  to  the  literature,  has  proved  to  be  effective  from  a  didactic viewpoint  (Guieu  2009).  Furthermore,  it  has  been  found  that  LOGO provides an apt environment for PBL. In this regard, Çukurbaşı and Kıyıcı (2017) found that PBL activities could be facilitated through LOGO and that  this  contributed  positively  not  only  to  student  success  but  also motivation  in  the  learning  context  especially  if  this  is  combined  with  a

flipped-classroom approach. This aligns well with other research on PBL in mathematics contexts,  where  it  was  determined  that  such  an  approach motivated students when they collaborated in problem-solving activities (Botty et al. 2016).

Furthermore, programmes facilitating coding languages, such as LOGO, present opportunities in terms of the current trend in play-based education by introducing visual environments such as Scratch (Dhakulkar &amp; Olivier 2021; Wilson, Hainey &amp; Connolly 2013) and Kodu (Stolee &amp; Fristoe 2011) makes coding fun and accessible to young children (Dagiene et al. 2013). Projects that focus on creating games, animations and stories with coding environments, such as Scratch 2.0 (MIT Media Lab 2022) and Alice 3.6.0.3 (Carnegie Mellon University 2021) have also been developed (Ouahbi et al. 2017). After a study of the correlation between programming games and mathematics  tests  (Lewis  &amp;  Shah  2012),  learners  acquired  significantly more positive attitudes towards this discipline.

The more recent findings around using Scratch also show positive results and affordances that are similar to the use of Scratch coding, accelerating the learning curve. However, the effect has been twice as great in social studies as in mathematics, and the greatest effect is the result of a more positive  adjustment  between  cognitive  as  well  as  certain  motivational factors;  learners  working  in  social  studies  have  shown  higher  levels  of pleasure  as  well  as  confidence  in  the  process  of  self-directed  learning (Moreno-León, Robles &amp; Román-González 2016). The results led to new questions that prompt more in-depth investigation into the differences as regards  the  educational  impact  of  coding  according  to  the  subject  or chosen activity. The potential of serious games and coding by Scratch 2.0 has been proven as a pedagogical tool to involve learners in mathematics classes and thereby improve their academic performance (Zavala, Gallardo &amp; García-Ruíz 2013). In addition, research has shown, in terms of PBL, that problem-solving skills can be developed while using Scratch 2.0 (Brown et al. 2008; Calao et al. 2015; Ching-San &amp; Ming-Horng 2012; Denning 2009; Kalelioğlu  &amp;  Gülbahar  2014;  Resnick  2013),  but  there  are  no  significant differences in any of these studies (Lai &amp; Yang 2011). The limitations of the LOGO environment in computer literacy are related to a lack of autonomy (Resnick et al. 1996). Consequently, this emphasises  the  need  for interventions  focusing  on  SDL.  In  this  regard,  any  such  implementation should  involve  opportunities  for  learners  to  take  charge  of  the  learning process  alone  or  collaborative  in  determining  their  needs  in  terms  of learning and then also setting specific goals and choosing relevant learning resources  and  strategies  towards  reaching  the  set  goals  and  then  also evaluating the process (cf. Knowles 1975). Furthermore, for this chapter, the aspect of computation thinking was a key part of the broader conceptual framework underpinning the intervention.

## Computational thinking: Conceptual framework

## Design

The new direction of computation in the classroom is to solve problems either in a disconnected way or by using technology, which can improve learners'  critical  thinking,  logical  reasoning,  community,  creativity  and communication skills, which are the most in-demand in the 21st century. These aspects also relate to many of the skills associated with SDL (Olivier 2019). Furthermore, the assessments in this research were structured to support  PBL  (cf.  Wood  2003).  Computational  thinking  means  using abstraction  and  decomposition  when  dealing  with  a  large  and  complex task  or  designing  a  large  and  complex  system;  separating  the  different aspects; selecting appropriate ways of representing a problem or modelling some pertinent aspects of a problem to make them accessible.

Moreover, thinking  similarly  as  a  computer  programmer  means  much more than knowing how to program - it also requires functioning at several levels of abstraction (Van Bakel &amp; Lescanne 2008). Computational thinking is  one  of  several  skills  whose  application  is  not  limited  to  computer programmers;  it  is  regarded  as  a  set  of  attitudes  and  skills  that  are considered  universally  applicable  (Wing  2006).  This  approach  can  be divided into four main categories:

- · Decomposition: Understanding that to solve a complex problem, it must be  broken  down  into  several  simple  problems;  the  learner  correctly solves all  the  subproblems related to the modelling process; and the detection of variables and the relationships and connections between them according to a specific model.
- · Pattern recognition: Understanding that a new problem would likely be linked to other problems already solved by the learner.
- · Abstraction: Comprehending  a  problem  and  its  solution  at  different levels, then extending the solution of similar situations independently of the context.
- · Algorithms: Thinking about tasks that must be accomplished in a series of steps (Tchounikine 2017).

Concerning  the  computational  approach  -  problem-solving  around  the theme of the geometric construction of the shapes in question - we have adopted  three  phases:  mathematical,  algorithmic  and  computer,  and the passages between them where the learner translates on the machine the algorithms prepared in advance and consequently the mathematical concretisation and didactic transposition of the mathematical model to a computer model (Balacheff 1994) via the algorithmic model (Chevallard 1986).

Each CT concept corresponds to one or more phases (cf. Table 6.1):

- 1. Decomposition (Phase 1).
- 2.  Recognition of shapes, identification, trial and error, and appropriation of the problem (Phase 1).
- 3.  Abstraction and decontextualisation (Phase 1, Phase 2).
- 4.  Generalisation (Phase 2, Phase 3).
- 5.  Execution of algorithms (Phase 3).

## Attitudes and skills targeted

In this research, certain specific attitudes and skills were targeted in the process of facilitating CT through LOGO coding using PBL for SDL, namely:

- · The innovative spirit: Improving analytical, organisational, collaborative, logical and critical thinking.
- · Self-confidence: Developing  learners'  autonomy,  risk-taking  and  free expression of their viewpoints.
- · Profitability: Being part of new material that is useful for many trades and fields.
- · Efficiency: Learning to solve a problem more accurately and in a short time.
- · Creativity: Creating new avenues for the solution.
- · Learning through play: Using play as a way of acquiring new skills.
- · Computational thinking-related skills as well as more general skills, all of which can be worked on in fields other than mathematics.

In terms of CT, other skills that were covered included (1) knowing how to be able to break down a problem into simple tasks, (2) knowing how to recognise  tasks  that  have  already  been  performed  or  are  repeated (reusability  of  codes  and  repetition  of  schema),  (3)  learning  to  work together  on  a  common  project  (this  thinking  promotes  autonomy  and collaborative  work)  and  (4)  fostering  imagination  to  develop  short  and effective solutions.

In order to evaluate these attitudes and monitor their evolution, we were interested  in  motivation,  a  coding  situation,  an  algorithmic  approach, structuring and the evolution of the coding, as well as errors committed during the execution.

## Methodology and method

## Research design and methodology

This quantitative quasi-experimental study involved comparing pre- and post-tests of an experimental and a control group of learners. This research adhered to all relevant Moroccan research ethics and permission requirements. Ethics approval was also obtained for this research to be conducted.

## Sample

Among the 210 learners distributed into six classes in the second year of secondary school, a class of 40 learners was randomly selected and then divided into two groups: (1) An experimental and (2) a control group. Only learners with parental permission and who assented to participating in this research were involved.

## Approach

We conducted workshops in class while using appropriate assessments to test our approach. Despite both groups being exposed to LOGO earlier, the control group handled the allocated sections through a more traditional approach. While the experimental group was supported in PBL through tasks based on authentic problems and, in line with the approach followed by  Botty  et  al.  (2016),  learners  collaborated  with  peers  in  solving  the problems.  Because  of  the  age  of  the  learners,  the  teacher  acted  as  a facilitator throughout the process and fostered more independence among the  learners  as  the  process  progressed.  These  latter  learners  were  also prompted to take charge of their learning and resource selection towards fostering their SDL. For the sake of the research ethics, the control group also  had  the  benefit  of  exposure  to  the  PBL  tasks  on  LOGO  after  the intervention was concluded.

A pre-test, post-test and survey for both groups were conducted based on official instructions for secondary mathematics instruction (Table 6.2). For this level, learners must know how to build simple geometric shapes to calculate  the  quantities  (e.g.  angle,  perimeter  and  surface)  and  to  use trigonometric relationships.

For this purpose, learners from a selected public school of the Regional Academy  of  Education  and  Training  (AREF)  of  Marrakech-Safi  were sampled. The pre-test and the post-test were prepared to evaluate and confirm  or  reject  our  hypotheses.  The  experimental  group  focused  on creating a PBL environment through which SDL could be fostered in their usage of LOGO.

## Pre-test

The purpose of this test was first to evaluate the learners' achievements in geometric  construction  and  related  concepts  (angles,  orthogonality, parallelism, axial symmetry, etc.) and then to study the homogeneity of the two  groups.  The  test  consisted  of  reminders  of  the  basic  notions  of geometry seen in the first year of secondary school, followed by a test of 20 questions spread over different axes made to diagnose and test.

## Coding knowledge

Note that all classes at this level have already studied the LOGO coding course in the computer curriculum. Learners were introduced to the notion of algorithms and concepts, such as the basic LOGO primitives: Sequence, variables, iteration [loops], structures, functions, procedures and conditions.

<!-- image -->

## Post-test

The experimental group, such as the control group, underwent a knowledge test. The test consisted of 20 questions distributed on different axes made

during geometry. The post-test consisted of a set of criteria that allows the five concepts as mentioned earlier in CT to be included. The development of the skills studied in this research during the experimentation phases was then evaluated.

In addition to the assessment to measure the degree of development of learners' skills, a survey was simultaneously prepared and applied to the experimental group in the form of a questionnaire consisting of 20  questions.  A  questionnaire  and  an  evaluation  grid  were  chosen  to process and analyse the attitudes and perceptions of the learners being tested. According to this criterion, learners would undergo an assessment of perceptions and attitudes, indicating whether they are 'well satisfied', 'satisfied', 'not very satisfied' or 'not satisfied'.

## Post-test and questionnaire criteria

## Evaluation criterion

Students should receive feedback, from the writing of programs to their execution, objectively evaluate their programs based on tests, and modify and improve them to adapt them to similar situations.

## Attitude and perception criterion

The objective of this criterion is to reference attitudes downstream of the treatment resulting from the results of the self-assessment and summative assessment,  which  demonstrates  motivation,  cooperation,  commitment, independence  and  belonging  simultaneously  and,  as  such,  gives  some sense of learners' self-directedness.

## Conducting the experiment

After the pre-test of both groups:

- · The control group learners were invited to a mathematics session to draw the geometric shapes (i.e. equilateral triangles, hexagons, octagons, pentagons, rectangles and squares) in a classical way using traditional didactic tools.
- · The experimental group learners had already initiated drawing the same shapes (i.e. equilateral triangles, hexagons, pentagons, rectangles and squares) through LOGO during the sessions. Each learner was invited, too, as in the case of the control group.

The practical work was carried out in the school's computer room, equipped with ten computers (Figure 6.1) over six classes and six weeks. Thus, the

experimental group was grouped in pairs during the practical sessions. The different activities that were carried out are described in Table 6.3.

## Processing of experimental data

For our experiment, the learners were led, on the one hand, to pass a formal test as part of the summative evaluations and, on the other hand, to answer a diagnostic questionnaire on motivation and perception. Thus, the data from the experiment were processed in two parts.

## Component 1: Assessment by a knowledge test

Learners were assessed on the concepts and skills covered in six exercises:

- 1. Exercise 1: See the control of decomposition.
- 2. Exercise  2: Test  learners'  knowledge  in  basic  notions  of  pattern recognition,  identification,  trial  and  error,  and  appropriation  of  the problem at hand.
- 3. Exercise 3: Test the level of abstraction and decontextualisation.
- 4. Exercise 4: Diagnosing skills concerning generalisation.
- 5. Exercise  5: Assess  learners'  learning  outcomes  in  basic  concepts  of combining partial solutions into a single overall solution.
- 6. Exercise 6: Study a more complicated case to exploit all the concepts of CT, from decomposition to algorithm.

- · Calculate the number of sides and the angle of rotation for the first three shapes, respectively (square, rectangle and equilateral triangle)
- • Calculation (number of sides * angle of rotation) for each
- • Gathering results in a table in this form:

| Form      | Number of  sides (Ns)   | Angle of  rotation  ( Θ )   | Number  of sides *  angle of  rotation  (Ns *  Θ )   |
|-----------|-------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Square    |                         |                             |                                                      |
| Rectangle |                         |                             |                                                      |
| Triangle  |                         |                             |                                                      |

Note that:

- ◦ For the square and the rectangle, the angle of rotation does not pose any problems as it is equal to the complementary internal angle (90°).
- ◦ Whereas for the equilateral triangle, the learners must use the relation of the sum of the angles of a triangle (180°) to extract the internal angle of the triangle (180° ÷ 3 = 60°), and then the angle of rotation is complementary (180° - 60° = 120°).
- ◦ At the end of these three examples, the learners arrive at the dual formulas for the geometric construction of the forms in question: Ns * Θ = 360 → Θ = 360 / Ns Calculation of Θ for the other forms (pentagon, hexagon and octagon)
- ◦ Transition to execution (Phase 3: Practical part)

## Component 2: Satisfaction questionnaire

In  order  to  get  an  overview  of  the  motivation  for  coding  and  the  new method of learning mathematics, we developed a satisfaction questionnaire. Our  questionnaire  consisted  of  20  questions.  They  aimed  to  identify learners' attitudes and perceptions:

- 1. The  first  three  questions  (Questions  1-3)  provided  information  on learners' experience with the LOGO environment: We wanted to know whether they had used LOGO elsewhere as well as the number of uses.
- 2.  Questions  4-9  provided  information  on  learners'  opinions  on  coding using the classroom environment.
- 3.  Questions  10-15  provided  information  on  learners'  attitudes  towards coding.
- 4.  The  last  questions  (Questions  16-20)  measured  learners'  motivation and  perception  thereof,  as  well  as  their  perception  of  coding  in  the mathematics classroom.

These tests were selected to compare the relevance of our PBL-supporting SDL approach to CT with that of the traditional method.

## Results

## Result of student assessment (Component 1)

The first part of the Result section illustrates the results obtained from the pre-test  and  the  post-test  of  both  groups  (control  and  experimental groups).

Table  6.4  and  Figure  6.2  represent  the  pre-test  results  for  both  the control and experimental group.

As shown in Figure 6.2, the pre-test results are quite similar in the two groups,  which  is  ascribed  to  the  fact  that  the  groups  were  created  by learners with similar or homogeneous features.

Table  6.5  and  Figure  6.3  represent  the  post-test  results  for  both  the control and experimental group.

As is evident from the figure, there is quite a remarkable difference in the noted results of the post-tests, as the average of the experimental group results, which increased by 20.2 and 23.19 points, is greater than that of the control group, which decreased by 1.68 on average, while the number of  learners  who  completed  the  forms  for  both  groups  is  presented  in Figure 6.4.

As an interpretation, the construction of the square and rectangle does not pose any problems because the angle of rotation does not pose any problems. On the other hand, as regards the triangle, for the control group, the  difficulty  arose  in  terms  of  mastering  the  rule  and  the  semicircle, whereas the experimental group used the repetition (repeats n times) or the forward, reverse and turn commands according to the program history to save time and to provide feedback in the event of an error.

The results also show a significant difference between the behaviours of the  experimental  and  control  groups.  Also,  there  was  an  evolution  of geometric abstraction for the experimental group: The results gradually evolved from the square to the octagon, even if the difficulty increased, simply because the learners managed to generalise the computer solution for all the constructions requested by using loops and repetition by noting the relationship (number of repetitions * angle of rotation = 360°) of the first  two  examples  and  that  the  number  of  repetitions  is  equal  to  the number of  sides  that  are  similar.  Conversely,  in  the  case  of  the  control group, their results decreased successively with the increase in difficulties in constructing the proposed shapes.

Note that, in the case of the triangle, the two groups were homogeneous. The overall  results  show  that  the  coding  tool  increased  abstraction  and geometric  generalisation  in  learners  compared  to  traditional  methods; hence, the development of concrete problem-solving skills in a computerbased manner is considered one of the important objectives of CT.

It should also be noted, as observed, these exercises created in learners the perseverance and challenge to build other more complex forms and to create,  innovate  and  solve  mathematical  problems  differently  through algorithms and procedures translated into programs. This is clear in the last exercise of the summative evaluation (post-test), where the main objective was the development of generalisation and abstraction that should be used to draw Forms 1, 2 and 3 (Figures 6.5 a-c).

- · P7:ReD1Av(2*D1)
- · P8:Repeat3[avD2tg120]

Some suggested tracks are noted in Table 6.6.

As an interpretation, the learners in the experimental group accumulated knowledge by pressing on the rotation of angles and sides, or sometimes shapes, as in the case of Form 1 (rotation twice of a square) and Form 2 (rotation eight times of a diamond).

Most learners in the experimental group quickly broke down the forms in question into small, simple forms, duplicated or rotated them. Indeed, in the experimental group, about fifteen learners managed to build Form 1 and Form 2, while only ten learners of the control group realised Form 1 and Form 2. This significant difference confirms what was said earlier.

## Result of the questionnaire (Component 2)

The data from the questionnaire show that the majority of learners showed an  excellent  impression  of  this  environment:  eighteen  learners  of  the

experimental  group  and  sixteen  learners  of  the  control  group  showed interest  in  discovering  this  environment  in  mathematics.  However,  the number  of  learners  who  confirmed  their  interest  in  developing  their capacity  to  work  with  this  coding  environment  that  was  used  by  the experimental  group  (more  than  by  the  control  group)  was  as  follows: thirteen learners of the experimental group - two learners used the LOGO environment less than ten times, five learners between ten and 20 times, three learners between 20 and 30 times, and three learners used it more than  40  times.  However,  seven  learners  never  used  this  environment elsewhere; so, for the control group, only four learners used this environment less  than ten times and in a context other than geometric construction. As  regards  the  attitudes  of  the  experimental  group  towards  the  LOGO environment,  the  majority  found  coding  more  effective  in  teaching geometry than the traditional method. Only two learners were not satisfied. Most  learners  wished  to  integrate  coding  (not  necessarily  through  the LOGO environment) into the teaching of mathematics courses, particularly pertaining to geometric constructions.

## Discussion

At the start of this chapter, six research questions were posed. This section considers how these questions were addressed in the research conducted here. Firstly, we explored whether this type of LOGO coding has an influence on the learning of problem-solving in mathematics, especially in geometric construction, and it was found, in line with the literature (Çukurbaşı &amp; Kıyıcı 2017), this approach embracing PBL for SDL has a positive influence on the learning. Furthermore, we probed how problem-solving skills in geometry can be developed using the LOGO coding environment, and it was evident that using this PBL for SDL approach, these skills were developed and the learner responses confirmed this. In addition to this, we wanted to determine how playful LOGO coding can be used as an approach to motivate learners and,  as  stated,  the  learners  were  more  motivated  and  positive  to  the assessments  and  the  environment  through  our  PBL  for  SDL  approach. Finally,  we  also  explored  how  playful  LOGO  coding  could  contribute  to fostering SDL. From the recorded learner perceptions, it was evident that when working collaboratively with peers, the learners could identify their learning needs, choose appropriate resources and strategies, and evaluate their outcomes.

## Conclusion

The  objective  of  this  research  was  first  to  introduce  learners  to  CT  in geometry and then to analyse the effect of playful visual coding on the development  of  geometric  thinking  in  the  second  year  of  secondary

education through a PBL approach fostering SDL. In our experiment, we compared two homogenous groups at the same level, and statistical tests were applied to both groups.

The discussed results show a statistically significant  gain  in  understanding and improvement in the level of abstraction of learners in the experimental group.  It  can  also  be  concluded  that  the  development  of  mathematical thinking  using  a  problem-based  approach  with  the  LOGO  visual  coding environment  could allow learners to improve  their skills regarding mathematical processes and problem-solving while simultaneously supporting their levels of motivation as self-directed learners. Among the skills studied, we found that abstraction was developed in comparison to the traditional method of mathematics teaching, in this case, particularly by coding. Finally, problem-solving is an improving skill. In this process, the affordances  of  PBL  for  SDL  were  also  evident;  however,  perceptions specifically  around  SDL  were  not  measured,  which  was  identified  as  a possible extension of this research. However, aspects of SDL informed the processes followed, and this contributed to the success of the intervention.

Our future research will focus on experimenting with play and visual coding in other environments, such as Scratch , to explore its impact on the development of mathematical skills or to generally focus on how coding can improve  mathematical  thinking in young  learners and explore opportunities  for  effective  integration  into  teaching  practices  not  only related to geometry but also in mathematics and science education.

## Abstract

Linear equations present one of the first instances where learners experience the  use  of  multiple  representations.  Studies  indicate  that  learners  face several  challenges  when  dealing  with  multiple  representations  in  both moving  between  various  representations  of  the  same  phenomena  or

physical situation or interpreting the abstract representation in terms of the concrete phenomena and vice versa. But this also gives us an opportunity to provide the learners with instances rich in multiple representations. This chapter aims to unpack a play-based approach through which puzzles can be  used  to  acquire  certain  relevant  skills  and  foster  self-directedness through this process. Tinkering with the application provides a pedagogical approach which involves 'raw material' to understand and subsequently create the basic problem types generally used in teaching linear equations. This could be achieved by understanding the meaning of and moving from concrete  objects  to  their  mathematical  algebraic  representation  in  the form of equations. The interactive applications are part of a larger teachinglearning platform used in the schools. Furthermore, the next part of the approach gamifies this aspect of tinkering by allowing a space to ask peers questions in the form of puzzles and solve puzzles posted by the peers. Thus,  enabling  peer-learning  and  assessment  on  a  technology-oriented platform.  Finally,  we  discuss  cognitive,  pedagogical,  technological  and assessment aspects for such an approach and its challenges.

## Introduction

It  is  clear  that  solving  linear  equations  may  be  problematic  to  learners (Elkjær &amp; Jankvist 2021; Vlassis 2002) and that they often make various errors in this context (Hall 2002). In an attempt to address issues, learners may have in terms of solving linear equations, this chapter proposes the use  of  interactive  activities  as  a  way  to  learn  linear  equations  through gamification to promote self-directed learning (SDL). This chapter also, therefore, attempts to link up with the scholarship focusing on preparing student teachers to be able to facilitate a context conducive to effective learning and problem-solving concerning linear equations (cf. Casey et al. 2018).  Furthermore,  this  research  drew  theoretically  on  not  only  open education but also elements of gamification and SDL.

The central research aim guiding this research was to look at how the design of interactive activities can potentially aid in learning linear equations using gamification and promote SDL.

## Literature review

## Mathematics and linear equations

One of the core ideas in mathematics is to use different ways of representing the same information, which has been discussed in mathematics education literature (Arcavi 2003; Goldin 2020; Janvier 1987; Mainali 2021). Seeing the relationship between various representations and operating upon them

forms a key competency in learning mathematics (Mainali 2021). Representations can be both internal and external. For example, schemas or mental models are internal representations. While external representations can  take  various  forms,  such  as  verbal  (spoken  and  written),  algebraic, tabular, graphical, visual and numerical (Superfine, Canty &amp; Marshall 2009). One  can define external representations as 'external mathematical embodiments of ideas and concepts to provide the same information in more than one form' (Ozgun-Koca 1998). A more comprehensive definition of mathematical representations is given by Goldin (2020):

As  most  commonly  interpreted  in  education, mathematical  representations are visible or tangible productions - such as diagrams, number lines, graphs, arrangements of  concrete  objects  or  manipulatives,  physical  models,  written words,  mathematical  expressions,  formulas  and  equations,  or  depictions  on the  screen  of  a  computer  or  calculator  -  that  encode,  stand  for,  or  embody mathematical ideas or relationships. (p. 566)

In  each  of  the  external  representations,  mathematical  information  is encoded, which implies transforming a concept into a sign that can then be  decoded  to  be  understood.  To  successfully  understand  what  the representation  contains,  the  learner  has  to  decode  the  mathematical information encoded in the representation and operate on it. This is a crucial skill, as mathematical information can occur in different representations. To be able to adapt and use it to solve the problem will be required of learners. Mainali (2021) reviews the importance of various representations  in  mathematics  teaching-learning,  particularly  visual and  graphical  representations.  Understanding  representations  can  be viewed  from  perspectives  of  individual  cognition  and  social  practice (Stylianou 2008).

Linear equations present learners in mathematics with one of the first opportunities to work with multiple representations and are an important step  in  learning  algebra  (Arcavi  2004).  Several  studies  in  mathematics education note the problems that students have with linear equations. For example,  see  MacGregor  and  Stacey  (1993),  Adu-Gyamfi,  Bossé  and Lynch-Davis (2019), Cañadas, Molina and Del Rio (2018) and Hewitt (2012).

Word problems in mathematics are not recent, and their use dates from antiquity. Some of the earliest word problems date thousands of years ago, inscribed on clay tablets in Babylonian civilisation (Friberg 2008). Also, in the  current  mathematics  curriculum,  word  problems  form  an  important and integral part of learning mathematics (Verschaffel et al. 2020). However, word problems also  pose  a  great  challenge  to  learners,  where  abstract mathematical representations are in the form of words, and the learners have  to  assign  mathematical  meaning  to  the  words  and  then  perform operations on them to get a solution. In their comprehensive survey on

mathematical word problems, Verschaffel et al.'s (2020, p. 1) remark about the word problems summarises this well: 'Word problems are among the most difficult kinds of problems that mathematics learners encounter'. But what constitutes a word problem? According to Verschaffel et al. (2000) (as quoted in Verschaffel et al. 2020), this concept can be described as:

Word problems are typically defined as verbal descriptions of problem situations, presented within a scholastic setting, wherein one or more questions are raised the  answer  to  which  can  be  obtained  by  the  application  of  mathematical operations to numerical data available in the problem statement or on numerical data derived from them. (p. 1)

Word  problems  also  form  a  large  section  of  books  on  recreational mathematics. For example, books by Yakov Perelman and Martin Gardner feature  several  word  problems  which  are  challenging  to  solve  (e.g.  see Perelman 1957, 1979; Gardner 1981, 1986). But word problems come with unique  challenges  (Clement  1982)  and  are  prone  to  misconceptions  in interpretations and difficulties (Elkjær &amp; Jankvist 2021; Pawley et al. 2005).

In the case of linear equations, typical word problems involve presenting a  situation  containing  encoded  mathematical  information  required  to solve the problem. For example, a typical problem involving guessing a number  is:  I  am  thinking  of  a  two-digit  number  that  is  larger  than  50 dividable  ( ÷ )  by  4,  6  and  9.  What  number  am  I  thinking  of?  There  are several variations on this theme, and several problems can be constructed using  the  same  number.  We  discuss  this  further  in  the  context  of  the design of the activities.

As noted, the movement  between  mathematical  representations presents a challenge to the learners. We are trying to solve this problem of movement between representations via this design of open mathematical interactive activities using externalised memory and gamification. As the activities  are  published  openly,  the  idea  of  open  educational  resources (OERs) is also highly relevant to this work.

## Self-directed learning

In the process of learning about linear equations by means of games, it is also essential to support the self-directedness of learners. Consequently, the concept of SDL was relevant to this research. One of the most used definitions of SDL is by Knowles (1975, p. 18) as defined in Chapter 1, in which he looks at various facets such as taking the initiative, learning needs, learning goals, resources and learning strategies.

Research  has  shown  how  a  gamification  strategy,  specifically  in  the online  context,  can  support  learner  SDL  in  a  very  positive  manner

(Palaniappan &amp; Noor 2022). Importantly, for the sake of SDL, a gamification approach should involve frequent and quick feedback, have a balance of game elements for critical thinking, include choices for self-management and have reward structures supporting motivation (Lindberg 2019).

Furthermore,  the  intersections  between  SDL  and  OERs  have  been established  in  the  literature  (Olivier  2021),  as  access  to  resources  and selecting appropriate resources are key to effective SDL. In this context, OERs are briefly discussed.

## Open educational resources

An important part of the proposed intervention in this chapter is using an openly-licensed resource. Consequently, it is recommended that an OER is used. The concept of OERs is defined by UNESCO (2019):

[…] learning, teaching and research materials in any format and medium that reside in the public domain or are under copyright that have been released under an open license, that permit no-cost access, re-use, re-purpose, adaptation and redistribution by others. (p. 5)

This approach implies that the resource proposed in this research can be reused  and,  more  importantly,  be  localised  for  any  other  context  and curriculum. From the scholarship of OERs and open education, there have been earlier examples of how open resources could be used effectively in supporting gamification  (García-Holgado  et  al.  2020;  Kokkinaki,  Christoforos &amp;  Melanthiou  2015).  Within  this  context,  using  OERs  is  recommended because they can not only be free but may also be adapted (Chen 2018).

It is important to note that specifically integrating OERs in the learning process for the sake of gamification is considered a complex task, especially in aligning the learning outcomes and purpose of the resource (Kokkinaki et al. 2015). This concept was explored further as gamification frames how learning was approached in this research.

## Gamification

As this chapter attempts to explore the design of interactive activities that can potentially aid in learning linear equations by use of gamification and promote SDL, a discussion on the recent scientific literature is pertinent to understand the nature of gamification. There has been a surge in interest in gamification in academia and research in recent years (Sailer &amp; Homner 2020).  Despite  the  fact  that  we  may  not  be  aware  of  it,  it  is  presently pervasive in our everyday lives (Dias 2017). Game design features may be employed  in  non-game  situations  according  to  various  definitions  in academic literature.  It  has  been  implemented  in  a  variety  of  disciplines,

such as commerce, employment, health and environmental studies (Behl et al. 2020; Larson 2020; Robson et al. 2016; Sardi, Idri &amp; Fernández-Alemán 2017), as well as the educational sector (Faiella &amp; Ricciardi 2015).

## Elements of gamification

In order to increase students' interest in their work and boost their extrinsic and  intrinsic motivation, one  method  that  has proven effective is gamification (Buckley &amp; Doyle 2016). In contrast to extrinsic motivation, which is driven by the pursuit of reinforcement, the term 'intrinsic' refers to the completion of an action for its own sake rather than for the sake of any external gain (Fischer, Malycha &amp; Schafmann 2019). Finding the underlying motivations  that  will  keep  people  engaged  is  crucial  when  designing gamification strategies. Connectedness with others (the feeling of interdependence),  competence  (the  feeling  of  being  able  to  complete tasks and the ability to execute a task to a certain level) and autonomy (the extent to which an individual's actions are motivated by their own interests) are  the  three  psychological  needs  central  to  self-determination  theory (SDT) (Deci &amp; Ryan 2016; Trigueros et al. 2019). For SDL and SDT to provide engaging gamification, players must feel independent, in command of their own actions and capable of accomplishing the game's goals (De-Marcos, Garcia-Cabot  &amp;  Garcia-Lopez  2017).  Considering  the  various  types  of players is essential for the success of gamification that aims to achieve this goal. Marczewski (2015) used the acronym RAMP (relatedness, autonomy, mastery  and  purpose)  to  summarise  the  four  main  sources  of  intrinsic motivation: A sense of belonging , control , competence and significance . Gamification goes beyond the traditional uses of game mechanics such as points, badges and leaderboards by using the underlying concepts of game design.  Most  studied  is  the  mechanics,  dynamics  and  aesthetics  (MDE) method proposed by Hunicke, LeBlanc and Zubek (2004). Game designers use the MDE model to provide a bridge between the game's rules mechanics, game dynamics and attractive aesthetics. To further dissect the gamification, consider the following:

- · Mechanics: Action  and  control  methods  available  to  players  in  the framework of a game are called mechanics. For example, you can select decks, gamble, barter, attack, compete and collaborate.
- · Dynamics: When  the  mechanics  are  being  implemented,  dynamic behaviour  is  what  is  supposed  to  happen.  For  example,  consider socialising, bluffing, reflecting, status and attention.
- · Aesthetics: When a player interacts with the game system, the system elicits positive emotional reactions from them, which we call aesthetics. In  addition  to  sensation,  fantasy,  story,  challenge  and  camaraderie, exploration, expression and amusement are some of the sub-categories (Hunicke et al. 2004).

## Using gamification to improve learners' motivation and academic performance

In  the  classroom,  students  are  more  likely  to  participate  if  the  game components  employed  in  gamification  have  clearly  defined  goals  and incentives. As per the research by Beemer et al. (2019), only 15% of learners who  participated  in  gamification  did  not  frequently  engage  in  physical activity,  with  statistically  significant  changes  compared  to  the  standard instruction  group,  for  example,  in  physical  education.  For  low-income educational facilities,  more  tactics  and  more  time  spent  participating  in breaks between programmes would be essential for better outcomes.

Gamification  with  quick  incentives  (points  and  badges)  and  a  story background  may  be  mainly  helpful  among  pupils  with  poor  motivation (Fernández-Rio et al. 2020). A study found that in university education, gamification increases student engagement and involvement, which leads to  an  improvement in academic achievement (Castañeda-Vázquez et al. 2019). As a result, gamification in education with the purpose of fostering healthy  habits  leads  to  a  more  active  and  positive  school  environment where students may get some exercise and have a good time.

It has  been  proven  that  gamification  may  also  increase  learners' participation and learning in scientific disciplines (Díez, Bañeres &amp; Serra 2017; Tsai, Lin &amp; Liu 2020). Student participation in the learning process is a key factor in this study's findings, as is the fact that students are able to perform the ongoing practice of their academic curriculum through game mechanics and continuous feedback, which provides clues and prospects for  reflection  when  they  encounter  difficulties.  Peer  interactions,  web blogs, challenges and prizes are used in the e-learning higher education institutional  (HEI)  setting  to  encourage  involvement  and  dedication (Garcia-Cabot et al. 2020). Writers are able to describe it because there is a happy medium between the level of difficulty and the students' abilities; this balance  between  complexity  and  their  capabilities  encourages students to persist and succeed throughout the course. (Fernández-Rio et al. 2020). Students' commitment to the course and learning may suffer if gamification elements like points, badges and leaderboards just reward behaviours with rewards in response to extrinsic motivation (Kyewski &amp; Krämer 2018).

Educational gamification, which incorporates foundations of science, technology, engineering, art and mathematics (STEAM), may effectively teach elementary school learners environmental stewardship. The goal of gamification,  according  to  one  definition  (Nurmi  et  al.  2020),  is  to promote  the  development  of  certain  habits,  such  as  persistence  and accuracy; therefore, it may be used to encourage students to engage in sustainable practices and civic competency in a fun and engaging manner

(Sipone et al. 2019). Students' interest and engagement may have been boosted by using game components, which positively impact their civic mindset and respect for the natural environment (Gatti, Ulrich &amp; Seele 2019). With those mentioned earlier, it is clear that using information and communication technologies (ICTs) in a fun manner to study may help increase student involvement, motivation and achievement in social and civic essential skills in higher education (HE) (Campillo-Ferrer, MirallesMartínez &amp; Sánchez-Ibáñez 2020).

The previous section highlighted why gamification is such a significant field of study in education. However, an SDL component is crucial to truly gaining the most from this approach, especially in an online or multimodal gamification approach.

## Gamification and self-directed learning

The  work  of  Zap  and  Code  (2009)  discusses  various  theories  of  SDL, including learner self-efficacy, learner self-determination, motivation, interest, intention, aptitude, goal and task orientation, self-awareness and metacognition, in the context of a review of the literature on SDL in game environments. The qualities of an authentic learning environment were also investigated.  Firstly,  similar  to  the  elements  of  gaming  settings  that encouraged  SDL,  this  includes  imitating  a  real-world  situation  in  which students make choices in a safe setting with no consequences. Secondly, students practise their newly acquired transferable abilities by engaging in authentic activities inside a virtual environment. Thirdly, learners learn via gamification by seeing and modelling the world around them. As a result, students have taken on a wide range of roles in investigating and developing new ideas. In contrast to their theoretical model, another research project used a grounded theory approach to extract the many SDL processes from video games and gamification approaches (Toh 2018). Research methods such  as  interviews  and  the  think-aloud  technique  were  also  utilised  to determine  whether  aspects  of  game  design  promote  player  agency  in video game contexts (Toh 2018).

## Methodology

## Research design, data collection and analysis

The research has a philosophical stance consistent with interpretivism. In  qualitative  research,  the  interpretative  philosophical  perspective  is focused  on  meaning  and  aims  to  comprehend  society  members' definitions  and  understandings  of  events  to  provide  light  on  how  a certain  group  of  individuals  makes  sense  of  a  given  situation  or

phenomenon (Maree 2020). In understanding the interpretive perspectives,  the  SDL  of  linear  equations  by  creating  and  solving puzzles,  which  imply  play-based  problems  in  this  chapter,  will  be investigated in a collaborative learning environment.

This study will use a qualitative methodology. According to Creswell and Plano Clark (2018), a qualitative design is one in which knowledge claims are made by the researcher largely on the basis of constructivist theories (i.e.  pursuing  a  hypothesis  or  pattern  by  considering  the  many  interpretations people  have  given  to  their  experiences,  both  privately  and  collectively, across  time).  According  to  Maree  (2020),  a  qualitative  design  seeks  to gather detailed, descriptive information about a phenomenon or situation to comprehend it better. In our analysis, we opted to sample subjects at random. As part of a larger course on linear equations, the sample included these  three  interactives  and  the  data  they  produced.  In  this  chapter, 'interactive' refers to any digitally manipulable object that may be used for instruction.  The  study tries  to  describe  aspects of interactives and their consequences for pedagogical procedures.

Regarding data analysis, the phrase content analysis may be roughly described  as  'systematic  data  coding  based  on  specified  themes  or categories' (Cohen, Manion &amp; Morrison 2018, p. 704; Fraenkel et al. 2012, p.  478).  It  is  possible  to  apply  content  analysis  in  both  practical  and theoretical  research.  Counting  and  classifying  words  in  a  measuring instrument or determining the frequency of themes via document analysis are two prominent examples. In a mathematics class, a researcher examines how gamification affects students' academic performance.

Artefact analysis is the method used to define the study of artefacts. A simple definition of artefact analysis is that it views artefacts as the results of human activity. To understand artefacts, it is necessary to understand the social context in which they are made and used (Bechky 2008; Schubert 2014). As previously said, this study focuses on 'artefacts' in the strictest sense,  that  is,  tangible  items,  structures  and  physical  layout.  Artefacts abound  in  organisations.  Therefore,  data  creation  on  artefacts  is  not concerned  with  producing  new  data  but  rather  with  selecting  artefacts that meet the study objective. An artefact's possible linkage to one or more aspects of innovation, that is 'ideas', 'outcomes', 'people' and 'transactions', is  the  end  direction  of  this  study  design  that  tries  to  understand  the implementation of gamification in the classroom. There are many examples of artefacts. Firstly, it is also worth noting that some artefacts are regularly employed in the innovation environment. Secondly, researchers may use artefact  analysis  to  apply  to  broader  concepts.  Choosing  artefacts  that each organisation's unique actors think are significant for decision-making

and communication in general and innovation in particular is one concept. In  terms  of  the  organisation's  public  image,  identifying  long-standing artefacts that have played a significant role in the organisation's everyday operations is another key element (Froschauer 2009).

## The learning context

The three interactives presented here are designed to provide the students with externalised memory where they can interact with the application to create new instances of the problems. The interactives can be classified as virtual manipulatives, defined as 'digital artefacts that resemble physical objects and can be manipulated, usually with a mouse, in a similar way as their  authentic,  concrete  counterparts'  (Bartolini  &amp;  Martignone  2020, p. 487). The interactives also provide a 'board' where the students can save the  manipulations  and  calculations  done  in  the  context  of  forming  the puzzles. Each interactive provides different types of essential data which can be used in forming and solving the puzzles.

The modules and units in which they appear are OERs released with Creative  Commons  (CC)  BY  license.  This  means  they  can  be  accessed online and can also be downloaded for offline use. Initially, they were part of a specially designed learning management system (LMS) platform to work on schools' local area network (LAN). Discussion on the features of the platform that help in gaming aspects is done in a later section in this chapter, titled 'Gamification via the platform'.

The first interactive is based on coins and their monetary values. The presence of coins of different denominations presents us with many natural opportunities to form puzzles. The number of coins and their denominations form the two parameters which are helpful in this activity. The interactive designed to help in this activity allows the learner to change these two parameters independently.

## Coins

The  first  context  uses  the  different  monetary  coins  to  form  puzzles,  as shown in Figure 7.1. In this case, the students can use information about the number of coins and their monetary values for solving and forming puzzles. In this section, Rs. (or ₹ ) refers to Indian rupees.

The learner enters the different  number of coins (denominations of Rs. 1, Rs. 2, Rs. 5 and Rs. 10), the total amount and total number of coins are  calculated,  and  the  results  are  written  to  the  board.  The  interface shown  below  allows  the  learners  to  change  the  denominations  of  the coins.  Clicking  twice  on  the  denomination  of  a  coin  will  change  the

coin denomination. Once the coins are chosen, the learners can change the number of coins by typing the required number using input boxes. This action readily calculates the following:

- 1. Total amount of money in coins.
- 2.  Total number of coins.

For example, in Figure 7.1, we have six coins of H 1 and 5 coins H 2. This information is used to calculate and display the total amount equal to H 16 and the total number of coins eleven. Once this information is generated, the student can write this information to the board. Depending on what information  is  hidden  and  what  is  given  in  a  puzzle,  different  types  of problems can emerge. For example, if the total amount (money) of coins is not given, but other information is given, then the problem can be to find the total amount that is present. In the other case, if the total amount is given with some denominations, the total number of coins or coins of any particular denomination can be found out. Starting from straightforward puzzles, the puzzles can become complicated, requiring several steps to solve.  From  the  same  set  of  data,  several  puzzles  can  be  generated, depending on what is hidden. Though it might seem trivial,  developing

puzzles is a cognitively challenging task. Hiding too much information can lead  to  unsolvable  puzzles.  But  to  create  a  solvable  word  puzzle,  the learners must solve it themselves.

At the same time, the learners can also use some interactive elements to solve  the  puzzles.  They  can  add  the  partial  data  to  see  what  type  of equations result from that as an aid to solving the puzzles.

## Ages

The second interactive involves forming puzzles with ages. Puzzles with the  ages  of  various  people  are  quite  common.  They  typically  involve providing the sums and differences in the ages or the ages of the smallest or largest individual in the sample. In the interactive tool shown below, the learner can enter the ages of the individuals in the sample by numbers in the  input  box.  Once  the  ages  are  entered  by  clicking  on  the  'Calculate' button,  the  interactive  finds  and  gives  information  regarding  the  data entered. This information includes:

- 1. Age of the youngest person.
- 2.  Age of the oldest person.
- 3.  Difference between the largest and the smallest ages.
- 4.  Sum of all ages.

The user enters the ages of the four persons, and the interactive, as shown in Figure 7.2, computes some of the common data used in creating puzzles based on ages.

Using the information calculated from the data entered, various puzzles can be formed.

If  the  learner  changes the values of clicks on calculate. The new calculated values are stored in the board as in the previous activity. Thus, the learner can experiment with a large number of values to create puzzles from them.

## Number

The number puzzles perhaps form the most common puzzles found and allow  for  the  most  flexibility  for  the  puzzle  creators  among  the  three interactives considered here.

In  the  example in Figure 7.3, the number '65' is factorised by various other numbers as selected by the user, and the result is written on the board.

The next interactive uses integers and their factorisation to form puzzles. The core mathematical idea used in this activity is that a given number can be  represented  in  many  ways.  The  four  basic  operations  of  arithmetic,

namely,  addition,  subtraction,  multiplication  and  division,  allow  us  to represent a given number as a combination of others. This interactive helps the learners to achieve or visualise exactly this. A learner can input a given number in the text input box. In the next step, the learners click on any one number 1 through 10 to find out the factors of the given number with these numbers.

## How the interactives are to be used by the learners

The learners were provided with a demonstration of the interactives and their features. After this, they were allowed to explore the interactives by repeating the given examples. In the second step, they were asked to create linear equations which could be solved for each of the three interactives. Finally, they were asked to create puzzles based on the linear equations that they had created with help from the interactives.

## Design aspects of the interactives

In this section, we consider some of the design aspects of the interactives and how they address some of the problems that learners face.

## Manipulatives and multiple representations

The interactives noted before use concrete visual images for the different contexts. In addition, when the learner inputs the parameters in the form of numbers, the interactives present the learners with information in mathematical form, sometimes with operations on them. For example, the total  age  of  persons,  the  total  amount  of  coins  or  the  result  of  the factorisation of a number. These expanded mathematical representations

are a mix of verbal, algebraic and numerical formats that the learners need to  understand to form linear equation puzzles. The movement between these  representations  and  operations  on  them  enables  a  mathematical understanding of the concept. The simple action of learners changing the parameters, for example, the number of coins of a given denomination, gives an immediate change in the following representations, thus scaffolding the movement between representations.

## Scaffolding - externalisation of memory

During the design of the interactives, one of the key problems that was kept  in  mind  was  aiding  the  movement  between  various  mathematical representations. The visual picture of the interactive helped with this. We tried to keep the interactives as simple as possible, and the output of the interactives was provided separately on a place called the 'board'. A board is a digital space where just like the blackboard in the classroom, one can write information to be accessed later. The information on the board can store multiple entries from the interactives. Each of the interactives has a board  where  the  learners  can  store  the  information  which  is  generated during working with the interactives. This information can then be used for creating puzzles. If  the  learners  feel  that  the  board  is  too  full,  they  can erase the board for a new start. Similarly, the learners can also use the board to solve the puzzles by using the interactive to input the information. Thus, the board is a dynamic personal external memory bank of the learner. We use the word dynamic as it is changed with the input, and the learners can see these changes happening. For example, in the number interactive, as  soon  as  the  factoring  number  is  clicked,  the  interactive  shows  the decomposition of the input number. Thus, the learner can access all this information  via  the  board.  When  the  information  on  the  board  is  not needed, or it is too crowded, it can be erased by the learners, and new information can be added. The learners can also copy this information to a notebook for access later.

## Self-directedness

The three interactives presented the previous three sections have strong elements  of  self-directedness  as  they  enable  the  learners  to  explore mathematical space safely. The ability to tinker and explore mathematical objects in the form of coins, ages of persons or numbers and immediately view  and  store  (on  board)  the  resulting  mathematical  information  and representations can allow learners to design and create their own examples to learn. These manipulatives can also generate different and a great variety of combinations of the parameters so that the learners can vastly expand their problem space.

Francom (2010, pp. 10-11) proposes four guidelines to foster SDL in learners. They include:

- 1. Matching the level of SDL learning required to student readiness.
- 2.  Progressing from educator to student direction of learning over time.
- 3.  Supporting  the  acquisition  of  subject  matter  knowledge  and  student self-directedness together.
- 4.  Having students practise SDL in the context of learning tasks.

In  the  context  of  this  chapter,  the  three  interactives  and  the  associated tasks can be used according to the level of the students. The difficulty of linear equation word problems via puzzles created and solved can indicate the  level  of  students.  This  can  vary  greatly,  from  simple  questions  to complicated  word  problems  as  allowed  by  the  imposed  conditions.  As soon as the teacher introduces the interactives in the classroom, a little hand-holding  will  be  involved  to  understand  the  interactives'  basic mechanics. Once the learners become aware of how the interactives work, they can be on their own, especially when it comes to posting and solving puzzles. The creation of valid puzzles in the form of word problems on linear equations has an implicit understanding of the mathematics involved. This is where the learners would display their own knowledge with problemcreating and problem-solving skills. This part of the activity would indicate a progression from teacher- to learner-orientation of learning. As discussed earlier,  the  interactives  support  the  movement  between  mathematical representations, which is the subject matter knowledge in this case. It is done in  a  manner  that  involves  a  lot  of  student  agency  and  autonomy. Finally, the fourth guideline is realised in the practice of posting and solving puzzles  (the  learning  task).  Thus,  we  see  that  several  desiderata  for fostering SDL can be seen in the interactives and associated activities. Of course, a lot will also depend on how the teacher in the classroom introduces and implements the unit.

In  their  synthesis  of  different  SDL  models,  Bosch,  Mentz  and  Goede (2019, p. 18) recognise three components of SDL for the learning situation. These three components are opportunity, support and collaboration. We now discuss how these components are part of the interactives:

- · Opportunity: The interactives provide almost limitless opportunities for students to explore the mathematical space by allowing them to control the interactives and the data generated from them.
- · Support: According  to  the  design  of  the  activity,  the  teacher introduces the interactives to the learners and then allows them to explore by themselves. The culmination of this process of exploring is the formation and posting of word problems in the form of puzzles. Support is available on the platform for operating the interactives in

the form of animated graphics interchange formats (GIFs), which can also be used in SDL.

- · Collaboration: The  activities  around the interactives were designed keeping in mind that there will be a group of two-four learners working on  a  computer  in  the  school.  This  approach  means  there  will  be enough circumstances for intra-group collaborative learning between learners working at the same computer (Dhakulkar &amp; Nagarjuna 2018). Working with other peers via the digital space of the platform can also provide opportunities for inter-group collaboration. Such collaboration  supported by the use of computers has been termed computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) (eds. Cress et al. 2021, p. 122) and has been extensively studied.

Similarly, Bosch et al. (2019) also present three components of learning: motivation, context  and  cognition. We  consider  how  these  three components are realised in the interactives and associated activities.

- · Motivation: From one of the author's (Dhakulkar, Shaikh &amp; Nagarjuna 2017) experience working with learners, one thing that stands out is the lack of avenues for learners to interact and share their knowledge in the  classroom.  The  design  of  the  activity  explicitly  involved gamification  for  sharing  knowledge.  The  gamification  motivates  the learners  to  ask  for  puzzles  from  peers  and  solve  them.  This  act  of creating puzzles and sharing them in a public space can be a great motivator for learners.
- · Context: Once  the  gamification  process  starts,  the  learners  take control of the teaching-learning process, as it involves peer-learning and  peer-assessment,  with  minimal  intervention  from  the  teacher. The classroom processes are shifted to the shared digital space on the platform.
- · Cognition: The interactives help the learners via the process of cognitive offloading by externalising the relevant data on the 'boards' where the relevant  information  is  easily  accessible.  This  process  can  help  the learners to focus on comprehending  the  mathematical  meaning embedded in different representations in the interactives. This process is complete when they can form word problems in the form of puzzles for their peers, and when they can decipher the mathematical meaning in the puzzles posed for them to solve.

## Gamification via the platform

Using gamification for continuous learning and SDL in HEIs, another study found that students who learnt through online gamification showed better results  in  their  knowledge  of  sustainability,  pro-environmental  attitudes

and achievement than students who learnt through traditional methods. According to the students who participated in this study, their motivation was based on recognition, competence and the sensation of belonging to a larger community (Mahmud, Husnin &amp; Tuan Soh 2020).

Though the three interactives  can  be  run  as  standalone  instances,  their value is much enhanced when they are used inside the specially designed platform.

One of the major challenges of working in government schools in India is the limited infrastructure in the form of accessibility to computing devices and Internet connection. To overcome this challenge, a student platform (CLIx Platform 1.0, TISS, 2018) was designed as a part of the larger project: Connected Learning Initiative (CLIx). 3  The student platform has innovative features that help us use the challenging infrastructure conditions to the fullest. The student platform is both a LMS as well as a content management system (CMS) and works on the LAN in the school lab. As the platform works via a 'school server' present in the school LAN, this design feature removes  the  dependency  on  the  Internet  and  simultaneously  gives  the learners an Internet-like experience.

Each  learner  is  given  an  individual  anonymised  login  (for  example, yellow-rabbit-xx, where 'xx' denotes school code) to the platform and can add other peers for a session via a buddy-login feature. The project was designed in such a way that three students worked on one computer during the  sessions.  This  arrangement  allows  us  to  maximise  the  utility  of  the infrastructure in the schools in addition to providing space for inter- and intra-group collaborative learning (Dhakulkar &amp; Nagarjuna 2018).

The platform allows the students access to the module's resources which include the instructions and help material in the form of animated moving images in a graphic interchange format (GIF) and downloadable GeoGebra ( GeoGebra Classic 6.0.7,  Markus  Hohenwarter  et  al.  2022)  files.  Pre  and post-test assessment items are included before and at the module's start and  end.  Each  unit  in  the  module  has  its  own  assessment  items.  The platform also allows the students to upload the media files that they have created, which are accessible to other peers. Each file and activity allow for comments and responses to be taken from the learner. This creates a space for discussion of activities in an explicit manner. The teacher can intervene in the discussions on the platform when required. The platform also creates a digital portfolio for the learners to record their actions on the platform. Thus, the learners can view their own learning over time and interact with their peers. Therefore, there are three major areas in which the platform's

design  helps  the  learners:  SDL,  peer-learning  and  peer-assessment  via gamification.

We have discussed the SDL aspect in the context of the activities. We will  now  discuss  peer-learning  and  assessment  via  gamification  in  the platform  next.  The  basic  idea  is  that  once  the  learners  are  comfortable playing  on  the  apps,  they  get  to  create  'puzzles'  for  other  learners  on the platform. They take help from the applications to create these puzzles and then post them on the platform via 'Comments' at the bottom of the activity  page.  These  comments  are  immediately  broadcast,  and  other learners can see these comments and attempt to solve these puzzles and post the answers to these via the 'Reply' option to the posted comment. They can take help from the apps to solve these puzzles. The original poster who posted the puzzle then checks for the correctness of the puzzle and replies to the answers indicating whether it is correct or not. Each learner or group of learners thus can create and solve several puzzles based on each app. Also, as the puzzles and their answers are always visible after being posted, the teachers can check and intervene if necessary. But this aspect is secondary. What the platform allows is for gaming the aspect of puzzle  solving  with  the  platform's  help,  thus  making  peer-learning  and peer-assessment possible.

## Examples of use: Gamification of linear equations

The features of the platform were described before making it amenable to introducing elements of gaming during the learning process. Sharing ideas and artefacts and interacting via comments in contexts of these makes the platform an enriching, safe space for learners. For the three activities under discussion, gamification happens via the creation of puzzles by the learners. These  puzzles,  created  with  the  help  of  the  data  from  the  interactive applications,  are  posted  on  the  platform  at  the  bottom  of  the  page  as comments. We discuss two examples of how such puzzles will be posted and subsequently answered.

## Example 1

Example 1 shown in Figure 7.4 is a puzzle based on coins and uses the data from the interactive coin application discussed in the earlier section titled 'Coins'. The puzzle by 'yellow-nitrogen' reads:

'I have 25 coins, 5 of them are  2, 10 coins are  5, and the rest are  1.Find the total H H H amount I have.'

In this case, the algebraic equivalent of this situation is:

T = 2 × 5 + 5 × 10 + 1 × X .

[Eqn 7.1]

where T is the total amount and X is the number of  1 coins. First, the H puzzle solver has to find the number of  1 coins H X . For this, the total number of coins is given and the number of  5 and  2 coins are given. Hence, if the H H number of  1 coin is H X , then:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Then using the equation for T , the solution is:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

[Eqn 7.3]

For  this  puzzle,  two  users,  'pink-mouse'  and  'pink-owl',  give  answers checked by another user 'pink-octopus'. This puzzle asks for only one of the denominations, though the peers have given answers for both.

## Example 2

Another example of a coin puzzle is shown in Figure 7.5. In this example, the puzzle reads [verbatim response given below]:

'I  have  Rs.  29  with  me.  The  total  number  of  coins  is  ten.  There  are n two denominations [ sic ]. I have 7 coins of […] Now solve this problem.'

<!-- image -->

Source : Screenshot taken from the student platform and exported by the authors, published with appropriate permission from the authors and institution.

In this case, the algebraic equivalent of this situation can be obtained as such: The total amount of currency is H 29. We are given that there are a total of ten coins and two denominations of the coins; let X and Y be the number of coins in the two denominations.

Hence:

X

+

Y

Or:

Y

=

X

- 10

[Eqn 7.4]

And coins of one denomination are seven in number. Hence, either X = 7 and Y = 3 or X = 3 and Y = 7. Hence our equation becomes:

```
n X + m Y = 29 Or: 3  + 7 n m = 29 [Eqn 7.5]
```

The interactive instance that was used to generate this data can be seen in Figure 7.6.

Now this equation cannot be solved with just given information. So we use other information that is available to us: the denominations of the coins.

= 10

The coins interactive can be accessed online at https:/ /clixplatform.tiss.edu/softwares/Tools/coins\_linear\_eqn/.

We have four integral denominations, namely, 1, 2, 5 and 10. We can check the equation in Figure 7.6 by substituting each of the denominations.

For n = 1. 3 × 1 + 7 m = 29, or 7 m = 29 - 3 = 26 or m = 26 ÷ 7; hence this is not acceptable. For n = 2. 3 × 2 + 7 m = 29, or 7 m = 29 - 6 = 23, or m = 23 ÷ 7; hence this is not acceptable. For n = 5. 3 × 5 + 7 m = 29, or 7 m = 29 - 15, or 7 m = 14, or m = 2. [Eqn 7.6]

This is an acceptable solution. We thus have 7 coins of  2 (and 3 coins H of  5) which fulfil the given conditions as indicated in the solutions posted. H Thus, these two examples show how a simple puzzle can be created.

## Discussion

The interactives and boards form a 'private' space for the learners that can enable  SDL,  while  the  posting  of  puzzles  and  their  solutions  forms  the 'public' space involving gamification and peer-learning.

The movement is between the concrete situations in the interactives, and their mathematical  and  verbal  representations.  The  learners  can  be individuals or groups of learners on a computer, and, in the latter case, it can also lead to collaborative learning.

The  interactives and  the online learning platform discussed here encompass several aspects of teaching and learning which are described schematically in Figure 7.7. There are two distinct spaces on the platform: private and public. The private space (as indicated in Figure 7.7) enables selfdirectedness, allowing the learners to explore and tinker with the manipulable mathematical objects in the interactives. These manipulable mathematical objects are in the form of concrete and visual representations, and the output is on the 'board' where it is in the form of mathematical representations. The 'board' is a private space of the learner (or group of learners). This form of externalisation  of  memory  enables  them  to  understand  the  relationship between  representations  and  create  and  solve  puzzles  based  on  the information there.

The public space in the form of comments by the learners is where the puzzles and their solutions are posted. This public space forms the basis of gamification, peer-learning and peer-assessment. Here the representation

is  in  verbal  form;  to  solve  them,  the  learners  have  to  go  back  to  their mathematical  representation  and  then  back  to  verbal  or  numerical representations as solutions.

The movement between the public and private spaces also enables the movement between representations. According to Dix (2008; [ emphasis in original ]), the  act  of  writing  is  a  form  of  externalisation  and  has  a transformative effect on the writer: 'Writing forces processing of your ideas and reflection on them' and 'writing makes your thoughts available as the object of study '.  In  our  context,  the  act of writing puzzles which have a coded layer of mathematical information. The task of solving the puzzle requires  decoding  of  this  mathematical  information  and  performing mathematical  operations  on  it  to  get  the  solution.  The  final  step  is  the interpretation of the mathematical operations in the concrete context of the problem (how many coins is the required number). Thus, this part of the  process  involves  movement  between  mathematical  representations, which was the learning objective behind the design of these interactives:

- · Linear equations and their solutions: The basic idea behind the interactives presented here was to aid the understanding of linear equations and their solutions by using multiple representations. We used three common and everyday contexts which are used in introducing linear equations, which are amenable to forming puzzles. These puzzles can be rich sources of discussion in the classroom. The interactives and their extension on the platform via gamification in the form of posting puzzles can further improve the learning process via peer-assessments and peer-learning.
- · Self-directedness: The interactives provide a safe space for the learners to tinker with the objects of mathematics learning. The tinkering aspect of these interactives is essential, linking SDL to microworlds based on constructionist pedagogy (Dhakulkar &amp; Olivier 2021). These interactives allow the learners to explore the space of different representations and enable  access  to  the  mathematical  data  generated  from  them.  The interactives allow the learners to operate at their own pace and in their own (private) digital space with strong elements of self-directedness. Furthermore, there is a potential for CSCL when a group of students use the interactives.
- · Externalisation of memory: The presence of 'boards' in the interactives was a design choice that was made explicitly to aid the externalisation of memory. The data on these boards can be effectively used to create and solve puzzles. As the interactives combine different representations, such as visual,  verbal,  numerical  and  algebraic,  they  can  also  help  in movement between representations. The 'boards' provide the information in an accessible format, thus providing 'cognitive offloading' so  that  the  learners  can  focus  on  creating  and  solving  the  puzzles. According  to  Risko  and  Gilbert  (2016,  p.  685),  'cognitive  offloading

represents one of the quintessential examples of how we use our body and objects in the external world to help us think'.

- · Moving between mathematical representations: The movement between representations and operating on them is a significant problem in mathematics  education  that  the  interactives  will  address.  The movement between verbal and algebraic is especially challenging, and the design of the interactives can potentially address the challenge by providing the learners with external scaffolding in the form of visual, verbal, numerical and algebraic representations.
- · Gamification: The gamification of mathematics learning is possible via the  platform.  The  gamification  happens  in  the  shared  (public)  digital space and allows the learners to interact with each other (Figure 7.7). The idea of posting word puzzles of their own creation for others to solve can be a powerful incentive for the learners and also to develop SDL skills. The very act of producing a puzzle, which is posted on the public platform for their peers to solve, can be great motivation for the students. Also, the resulting challenge to solve a puzzle posted by a peer can be seen as a great group or personal achievement. 'Who will solve the puzzle correctly first?' can be seen as a motivating factor for the learners, which is a human trait. For example, amongst scientists, the motivation  to  be  the  first  one  to  invent  or  discover  something  is significant. Similarly, 'Is my puzzle the toughest?' motivates learners to produce puzzles in very creative ways. Creating word puzzles can be quite a creative endeavour, as several parameters (e.g. the number of coins and the factorisation number) can be provided to form different types of word puzzles from the same data. Thus, the gamification of learning can add to the richness of the interactives and learning made possible by them.
- · Self- and peer-assessment: The gamification via the platform enables self- and peer-assessments. One aspect of self-assessment comes in when the learner posts the puzzles. To be able to create and post a puzzle, the learner has to solve and know the correct solution. Apart from these, there are self-assessment exercises on the platform. The learners can solve puzzles posted by other learners and provide their solutions,  which  can  be  checked  by  the  original  posters  and  other peers and mentors (teachers). Thus, the puzzles and their solutions can  be  enablers  of  peer-assessment  and  peer-learning.  This  is  a powerful  feature  of  the  platform,  enabling  learners  to  interact  in  a shared digital space.
- · Open educational resources: The student platform used in the project is released under a free and open-source software (FOSS) license, and the Unit on Linear Equations is released as an OER with a CC BY license applied. These  licensing  terms  allow  both  the  platform  and  the interactives to be contextualised to other teaching-learning contexts.

- For example, one can translate it into another language or change the currency in the coins puzzle. This set of resources adds to the growing repertoire of OERs.
- · Limitations: This work discusses the design aspects of the interactives, which attempt to address some of the issues reported here, is conceptual in  nature and is limited in its scope for discussions. Further empirical studies  involving  how  the  interactives  were  used  in  classrooms  by students and teachers would indicate if the design was successful in its learning  objectives.  These  studies  can  have  multiple  foci,  such  as mathematics  education,  gamification,  self-directedness,  collaborative learning, self and peer-assessments, and technology in education. They can  enhance  our  understanding  of  how  interactives  which  provide externalised memory can enhance learning. Finally, the cognitive aspects of  solving  linear  equations,  their  mental  representation  and  schemas, and  how  they  are  affected  by  such  interactives,  gamification  and platform can be studied.

## Conclusion

This research clearly shows that the design of online learning environments and their features should be carefully selected for their optimum impact. We  discussed  how  the  presence  of  external  representations  that  are interactive in nature could enable SDL in an online learning environment. The features of the online learning environment can, in addition, facilitate gamification of learning, self-assessments and peer-assessments. We hope that such teaching-learning environments with multiple objectives which scaffold learning in multiple ways can be accomplished.

## Abstract

In realising the need to align teacher-training with the development of selfdirected and critical 21st-century skills, the North-West University (NWU), South Africa, is breaking ground with the inclusion of LEGO® Foundation's Six  BRICKS activities in  its  professional  orientation  programmes  as  part of the teaching  practice  curriculum  and  research  activities. In this phenomenological  study,  a  purposive  sample  of  66  first-year  student teachers were exposed to a variety of engaging LEGO® Six BRICKS activities where they explored their ideas of teachers and the teaching profession, as well  as  prominent  role-players  in  their  journey  of  becoming  teachers. Instead of direct efforts to instruct student newcomers to the faculty about

professional identity and the development thereof, six LEGO® bricks are used to engage students in activities to foster conceptual understanding of the skills and attributes required by successful teachers and to prioritise each skill and attribute based on their understanding of the importance of each. A thematic analysis of photographs and narratives of these activities indicates the effect and value of hands-on LEGO® Six BRICKS activities as a play-based pedagogy in promoting self-directed learning (SDL) as firstyear students shape their understanding of the skills and attributes required by  the  teaching  profession.  This  chapter's  unique  contribution  lies  in exploring LEGO® Six BRICKS as a problem-based approach to developing teacher  identity  through  the  engagement  of  pre-service  teachers  in activities aimed at promoting communication and problem-solving as well as reflection and self-regulation as skills and attributes of pivotal importance for the teaching profession.

## Introduction

This chapter deals with first-year student teachers' perceptions of the skills and  attributes  required  by  the  profession,  their  aspirations  as  future teachers and their identification of prominent role-players in their journey of becoming teachers. It demonstrates how first-year education students can  be  guided  in  the  process  of  identifying  and  reflecting  on  their perceptions  through  problem-based  learning  (PBL)  (see  ch.  1)  and pedagogies of play (PoPs) (see ch. 2) as active approaches toward SDL.

After  stating  the  problem  that  sparked  this  research,  a  theoretical overview will be given regarding perceptions of teachers and the teaching profession. This will be followed by a critical discussion of the theories of SDL, PBL and play-based pedagogies that underpin the activity that firstyear  students  were  requested  to  perform  as  part  of  the  professional orientation  programme  that  constitutes  their  work-integrated  learning (WIL) experience in the first semester of their teacher-training. The chapter then  shares  information  about  the  professional  orientation  programme before  focusing  on  the  study's  research  design.  Furthermore,  we  share empirical data and the analyses thereof and make recommendations about the professional orientation of first-year education  students before concluding the chapter.

## Problem statement

This  chapter  focuses  on  two  challenges  experienced  in  the  Faculty  of Education at a higher education institution (HEI) in South Africa. Firstly, research conducted at this HEI (NWU) reveals that first-year Bachelor's in Education (BEd) often have a somewhat naïve view of teaching, linked to

perceptions that teaching does not require high-level knowledge and skills (Petersen &amp; De Beer 2019, p. 295). Lortie (1975) describes this phenomenon as  the  'apprenticeship  of  observation'  (AoO)  and  adds  that  it  is  largely responsible  for  many  of  the  preconceptions  that  student  teachers  hold about the profession. These preconceptions severely affect how students approach their teacher-training and form pre-professional identity (Dayan, Khan &amp; Ahmad 2022, p. 154; Jackson 2016a, p. 850; Rinke, Mawhinney &amp; Park 2013, p. 93).

Secondly,  studies  by  De  Beer  and  Gravett  (2016)  and  Dlamini  et  al. (2020,  p.3)  show  that  most  first-year  students  who  enrol  for  teachertraining at tertiary institutions seem unprepared to take responsibility for their  own  learning  because  they  emerge  from  an  examination-driven system.  As  a  result  of  the  pedagogy  of  'talk-and-chalk'  that  they  have become familiar with as school learners,  they  lack  SDL  skills,  expecting their lecturers to disseminate knowledge for them and guide them in every step of the learning process (Annandale &amp; Reyneke 2020, p. 53).

These challenges will be discussed in more detail in the sections titled 'The apprenticeship of observation' and 'Self-directed learning'.

## The apprenticeship of observation

Globally,  teacher-training  institutions  are  confronted  with  the  common perception that teaching is a profession that requires little formal study because  it  encompasses  nothing  more  than  what  school  learners  have experienced as observers and evaluators of professionals in action over at least  twelve  years  (Darling-Hammond  &amp;  Bransford  2006;  Lortie  1975). Darling-Hammond (2006) explains the notion of observers and evaluators of teaching by using the analogy of musical performance: A member of the audience may look at the conductor who waves his arms around and think there is not much to conducting a symphonic orchestra. Little does the spectator know about what happened behind the scenes to ensure the success of the performance. In the same way, school learners may think that teaching is easy as most first-year students who enrol for teachertraining at tertiary institutions seem unprepared to take responsibility for their  own  learning  because  they  emerge  from  an  examination-driven system (Lortie 1975).

According to Lortie (1975), school learners typically lack the analytical ability to critique their teachers' conduct and actions objectively, so they often  favour  a  teacher  based  on  personality  rather  than  pedagogical principles. Apart from the reality that students are often drawn to teaching because of the subjective opinion of any of their favourite teachers, their decision to study teaching may also be linked to parents as teachers, family,

babysitting, tutoring experiences or television programmes (Botha 2021, p. 13; Greenwalt 2014, p. 307; Manuel &amp; Hughes 2006, p. 22). Researchers such as Darling-Hammond (2006), Jackson (2016b, p. 934) and Botha and Reyneke  (2020,  p.  245)  highlight  the  importance  for  teacher-training institutions to challenge students' uncritical acceptance of notions about teachers  and  teaching  as  it  influences  their  pre-professional  identity formation. Linking to the argument made by Greenwalt (2014, p. 309), it is highly unlikely that student teachers will model their own behaviour on one notion of teaching practice because of their exposure to various teachers over  twelve  years  of  schooling.  Smagorinsky  and  Barnes  (2014,  p.  48) advocate for pre-service teachers to be guided in focusing on both the negative  and  the  positive  impact  of  their  previous  teachers  in  conceptualising a vision for their own pedagogical style. Smagorinsky and Barnes (2014, p. 48) found that student teachers who reflected on their lived experiences as school  learners  could  not  only  identify  different traditional and progressive  teaching  models  but  could  also  reflect  on  and  critique  the practice of their former teachers as they started projecting visions of their own future practice underpinned by constructivist principles.

Instead  of  aggressively  deconstructing  students'  perceptions  that constitute their AoO, designers of the professional orientation programme opted for a structured programme that would take students on a journey of SDL.

## Self-directed learning

Annandale and Reyneke (2020, p. 52) highlight the challenges faced by first-year university students in South Africa in bridging the gap between secondary and higher education (HE). Cognitively, the major challenge is moving from being spoon-fed to pass tests and high-stakes examinations (Brenner 2016; De Beer &amp; Gravett 2016) to active, critical engagement with academic  content  (Nasri  2017,  p.  7).  Rantsi  (2016)  remarks  that  South African learners find the progression from secondary school level to tertiary education challenging and postulates that the gap may be attributed to the  weak public schooling system. Therefore, it is of crucial importance that students who enrol for studies at the tertiary level, especially first-year students,  are  guided  to  cope  with  the  demands  of  HE  (Annandale  &amp; Reyneke 2020, p. 52). The focus should be on developing students' SDL skills,  not  only  to  attain  academic  success  but  also  to  prepare  them. According  to  Knowles  (1975),  SDL  can  be  seen  as  a  process  that  an individual  embarks  on  by  determining  their  own  learning  needs.  Once needs  have  been  identified,  clear  learning  goals  are  set,  resources  are searched for and appropriate learning strategies are selected and implemented. The final step is  to  evaluate  one's  own  learning.  The  SDL

process can be embarked on independently or with the help of others (see ch. 1). The idea is for student teachers to become increasingly self-directed as they mature, which is an essential proficiency skill for in-service teachers to  thrive  in  the  ever-changing  field  of  education.  In  fact,  the  three  SDL goals  described  by  Merriam,  Caffarella  and  Baumgartner  (2007)  are pertinent  to  teacher-training  and  pre-professional  identity  formation:  To promote  academic  self-determination,  foster  transformational  learning, and  enhance  emancipatory  learning  and  social  action,  which  form  an integral part of SDL.

In  terms  of  Goal  1,  Rogers  (1983)  highlights  the  need  for  a  sense of discovery coming from within the student in starting the move from a self-reliant  personality  towards  one  of  self-direction  and  autonomy.  The next goal, transformational learning, may be attained through a process of critical  reflection  which  is  an  intrinsic  and  critical  component  of  SDL (Brookfield 1986). Critical reflection and transformational learning support the  final  goal  of  promoting  emancipatory  learning  and  social  action (Merriam et al. 2007). In the context of this study, the developers of the professional  orientation  programme  (as  teacher  educators)  focused  on facilitating a process through which first-year education students would be guided in reflecting on their self-reliant perceptions of teaching and the teaching  profession  and  note  attributes  and  skills  sought  after  by  the profession as expressed in documents such as the National Qualifications Framework Act Policy on Minimum Requirements for Teacher Qualifications (MRTEQ) (Republic of South Africa [RSA] 2015, p. 11). The eventual goal remains  to  foster  critical  teacher  skills  such  as  self-directedness  to emancipate themselves and become agents of positive change in education.

Instead of placing first-year students in schools a mere three months after finishing their high school (Grades 8-12) studies and running the risk of confirming any existing AoO that might have a negative influence on training, academics responsible for WIL opted for a structured professional orientation programme that would take students on a journey of SDL. As pointed out by Knowles (1975), the first step of the SDL journey would be for students to identify gaps in their own understanding, in this case, their understanding of the attributes and skills required by the profession. The hypothesis, confirmed by various scholars in the field of teacher education quoted, was that once students' awareness was raised of their naïve or one-dimensional perceptions of teacher skills and attributes in disrupting their AoO, they would be in a better position to formulate their own learning goals and become more receptive to training. As newcomers to teacher education, students needed to be guided to critically reflect on their beliefs regarding teacher skills and attributes as well as important role-players in preparation  for  the  profession  (Botha  &amp;  Reyneke  2020,  p.  232;  DarlingHammond 2006, p. 4; Darling-Hammond &amp; Bransford 2006; Jackson 2016b,

p. 934; Lortie 1975). A metacognitive task, based on the challenge of AoO, had to be designed so that student teachers would want to engage with it and be comfortable sharing their personal perceptions and thoughts as they  learn  to  take  responsibility  for  the  development  of  their  own  preprofessional  identity.  According  to  Freire  (1970),  self-direction  and  selfdetermination  can  only  be  achieved  when  we  favour  problem-based education.

## Problem-based learning

Hmelo-Silver  (2004,  p.  240)  explains  that  PBL  caters  to  formulating effective  knowledge  between  the  lecturer  and  the  students.  Instead  of 'chalk  and  talk'  that  comes  down  to  nothing  more  than  the  lecturer transmitting knowledge to the student, the pedagogy of PBL stimulates critical thinking, problem-solving abilities, and dialogue between the two parties and among students. The latter engagements should be ensured by the design of PBL tasks to give students a sense of control, independence and responsibility so that SDL and self-regulated learning (SRL) skills may be developed. From the instructor's side, there should be quality scaffolding of students' knowledge and learning (Khoiriyah &amp; Hussamah 2018, p. 156). Scaffolding, which should act as an enabler (Benson 1997, p. 127), often involves posing multiple problem-related questions that direct students to respond using selected learning resources (Atta &amp; Alghamdi 2018, p. 624). In  this  study,  problem-related  activities  guided  participants  through  a process of critical engagement, collaboration and reflection with the aim of disrupting their AoO in preparation for teacher-training.

While PBL is centred around challenging students to solve a problem that is aligned with learning outcomes, the PoP could be used to encourage creativity engagingly.

## Play-based learning

In  contrast to popular belief, Leather, Harmper and Obee (2021, p. 209) state that it is not only learners who explore through play. Siviy (2016, p. 13) agrees that playfulness is a state of mind that many adults want to be in because it minimises feelings of pressure, tension and conflict when difficult situations  are  to  be  explored  (Hendricks  2015;  Šimůnková  2018,  p.  57). Moreover,  adults  benefit  from  opportunities  to  think  creatively,  connect ideas, and apply knowledge and skills without being concerned about a wrong  answer  or  finding  the  right  answer,  liberated  by  the  notion  that everyone can succeed in play (LEGO® Foundation 2021a). Solis et al. (2019, p. 8) and Nolan and Paatsch (2017, p. 52) add that playful learning develops intellectual skills and social, emotional and physical abilities. Other benefits

include  divergent  thinking,  emotional  regulation,  imagination,  humour, motivation,  positive  emotions  and  problem-solving  skills  (Gordon  2014, p. 249; Guitard, Ferland &amp; Dutil 2005, p. 15). Siviy (2016, p. 13) believes that PoP  should  already  be  introduced  at  the  school  level  as  engaging adolescents in play may lead to adults who can navigate a changing social, emotional and cognitive landscape.

Play-based activities at the tertiary level encourage students to explore systematically, experiment and continually iterate while learning becomes experimental, motivating, memorable and meaningful. In a world mostly driven by the exponential growth in technology, it has become increasingly important to promote the holistic development of students, more so in the case of pre-service teachers who need to be equipped with 21st-century skills  pertinent  to  the  profession,  such  as  communication,  collaboration, problem-solving, and creativity (Jacquelyn et al. 2017, p. 47; Rotherham &amp; Willingham  2009,  p.  20;  Teo  2019,  p.  176).  Holistic  development,  which includes  the  development  of  soft  skills  while  engaging  in  play-based activities to solve problems aligned with learning outcomes, is believed to contribute to feelings of success and happiness (Keung &amp; Cheung 2019, p. 636). On the other hand, recent studies in education report on learners disengaging from and not thriving in pure digital settings (Bergdahl &amp; Bond 2022, p. 2653; Gillett-Swan 2017, p. 28).

This  study  used  a  problem-based  approach  in  challenging  first-year education students to identify their ideas about teaching, evaluate these ideas and reflect on the profession as a first step in becoming a teacher, that is, taking responsibility for shaping their identities as future teachers. We used guided play, that is, play with some involvement from the lecturers (Holt et al. 2015), in this case, guiding questions.

We favoured the idea of student involvement with physical hands-on activities instead of digital activities. LEGO® offered the ideal solution as the LEGO® Six BRICKS initiative allows for manipulating concrete tools to explore and make meaning of challenging concepts.

## LEGO® as an alternative spatial tool to explore identity

LEGO® is known as interlocking plastic block-shaped toys that children use to construct anything they can imagine. The word LEGO® is an abbreviation of the two Danish words ' leg godt ' meaning 'play well' in English (LEGO® Foundation  2021a).  According  to  the  LEGO®  Foundation  (2021a),  it  has been part of the schooling system over the past three decades and has been used to promote learning in language and literacy, science, computing, mathematics and technology. While different sets have specifically been

created as educational sets (LEGO® Foundation 2021a, 2021b), LEGO® Six BRICKS is a concept designed by Brent Hutcheson, the director of Care for Education,  a  non-profit  organisation  in  South  Africa  that  aims  to  train teachers in all subjects and phases of education to include LEGO® in their pedagogy, and to excite and motivate students to learn through playing with six Duplo® blocks in different colours (LEGO® Foundation 2020).

Based on the need for lifelong learning in a rapidly changing world, and the impact of technology where foundational skills are crucial, it is increasingly important  to  assist  students  in  developing  21st-century  skills  such  as collaboration and communication, creative thinking and problem-solving.

## Empirical research

## Research paradigm

The research embarked on in this study is underpinned by constructivism. Constructivism focuses on the role of people in constructing knowledge, stressing  the  notion  that  experience  is  perceived  subjectively  and  not objectively (Crotty 1998). In the context of this study, based on their unique experiences and perceptions, students construct their own understanding of teacher skills and attributes and of important role-players in their journeys of becoming teachers.

## Research design

A qualitative research design was selected because it is exploratory and allowed the researchers to develop an understanding of the reasons and opinions  of  individual  participants  based  on  their  personal  experiences (Hennink, Hutter &amp; Bailey 2020). With this study, the researchers wanted to gain access to first-year students' perceptions of crucial teacher skills and attributes and  important  role-players  in  their  individual  journeys  of becoming  teachers  to  determine  the  role  that  AoO  might  play  in  preprofessional identity formation. By adopting this research design, researchers acknowledged that there is no absolute truth and that new information and knowledge emanating from the study would be situational and derived from the personal experiences of each participant (Roller &amp; Lavrakas 2005). This notion is highly applicable to the study as a wider and deeper understanding of students' perceptions was sought to allow for a deeper understanding of the AoO.

## Methodology

Within the qualitative research design, the phenomenological method was applied because researchers wished to gain a deeper understanding of the phenomenon that literature refers to as AoO and the possible effect thereof

on pre-professional identity formation. As highlighted in the literature, student teachers' AoO is a challenge that should effectively be dealt with as a first step in guiding prospective teachers in developing their pre-professional identity (Darling-Hammond  2006,  p. 13; Jackson 2016b, p. 935; Lortie 1975; Smagorinsky &amp; Barnes 2014, p. 48). Following a problem-based approach, the play-based activities  in  this  study  were  set  up  to  deal  with  this  challenge. Based on their unique experiences as school learners, students' perceptions were  activated  by  the  LEGO®  Six  BRICKS  activities,  where  they  could manoeuvre  the  blocks  as  they  wished  before  writing  reflective  narratives. Aligned with the  phenomenological method, the study considered participants' perceptions  during  the  activity.  The  narratives  generated  the  data  for  the study. The study also considers how participants experienced specific events or activities. Thus, a database with themes was formed to validate the findings. Ethical clearance was obtained from the institution involved.

## Sampling and data analysis

A purposive sample was drawn from the narratives submitted by all firstyear students enrolled for a BEd at the NWU. Purposeful sampling is a sampling method used in qualitative research design for the researcher to  identify  and  select  information-rich  cases  that  relate  to  the  real-life situation being explored (Creswell &amp; Cresswell 2017; Palinkas et al. 2015, p. 3). In this study, the researchers randomly selected 66 narratives from the larger first-year group. These narratives were constructed based on students' engagement with the LEGO® Six BRICKS activity, during which they explored their ideas of teachers and the teaching profession, as well as  prominent  role-players  in  their  journey  of  becoming  teachers.  This study  forms  part  of  a  larger  research  project  for  which  full  ethical clearance,  gatekeeper  permission  and  student  informed  consent  were obtained.  These  photographs  and  narratives  were  then  imported  into ATLAS.ti™ (ATLAS.ti Scientific Software Development GmbH) where the researchers read and reread the students' narratives to, through inductive analysis, identify themes. These themes were coded and will be discussed in the 'Student activities' section.

## Student activities

In this study, each first-year student teacher was given a set of LEGO® Six BRICKS and asked to perform the following task: The pre-service students were asked to construct a tower of their LEGO® Six BRICKS (Figure 8.1) with  the  skills  and  attributes  they  believed  were  important  for  teachers (see Box 8.1).

After  students  constructed  their  LEGO®  towers,  they  had  to  take  a photograph of their tower and write a narrative to explain their perceptions

## BOX 8.1: Task requirements.

## Task requirements

- 1.   T ake the six bricks you have received and place the six individual bricks in a straight line before you.
- 2.   Identify six crucial skills or attributes that you believe teachers should possess and assign each skill or attribute to a specific coloured brick.
- 3.   Now build a tower with the six bricks, starting at the bottom with the least important skill or attribute and putting the most important skill or attribute at the top. Take a picture of your tower so you can submit it with the narrative requested in Step 4 below.
- 4.   Make written notes on what each skill or attribute means to you as a future teacher. Justify your ideas. Then write a narrative in which you reflect on the skills and attributes that are important in your journey of becoming a teacher.
- 5.   There are certain basic competencies that beginner teachers need to have once they finish their pre-service training. These have been listed in the MRTEQ.
- 6.   Now reconsider your tower. How many of these competencies did you address in your first becoming attempt? Would you now like to make some changes? Would you like to change the skills or attributes that you have allocated to certain bricks? Would you like to change the order of the bricks in your tower? Remember to also make these changes to your notes!
- 7.   Once you have finalised your tower and your notes, create a table with the following column headings: Colour, skill or attribute, and justification.
- 8.   T ake apart your tower again, and now consider each brick as a role-player part of your journey to becoming a teacher.
- 9.   Build a cube where you indicate the importance of and interaction between these role-players. Take a photograph of your cube and add it to your MS Word document.
- 10.   Write a paragraph where you identify each role-player, justify the placement for that specific colour in your cube and indicate the value of this role-player in your journey of becoming a teacher.

of these skills and attributes in the context of becoming a teacher. Then they had to take their towers apart and consider each brick as a role-player in their journey to become a teacher. Next, they were requested to build a cube, indicating the importance of interaction between these role-players. Students had to take a photograph of their cube and add it to their Word document before writing a paragraph where they had to identify each roleplayer,  justify  the  placement  for  that  specific  colour  in  their  cube  and indicate the value of this role-player in their journey of becoming a teacher.

## Discussion of findings

## Perceptions of attributes and skills teachers need

Based on their  experiences,  first-year  student  teachers  named  various attributes and skills that they believed were important for the profession. A  thematic  analysis  of  the  qualitative  data  strongly  portrayed  the following four themes: Communication , patience , leadership and adaptability (Botha &amp; Reyneke 2020). Quotations that follow below are verbatim and unedited.

Several participants commented on communication with learners and communication with colleagues and parents. Student teacher 01 believes that:

'[…] teachers are known for the fun spirit and extrovert qualities, hence being a good communicator is a very important aspect for being a successful teacher.' (Line 12, gender undisclosed, March 2021)

Participants  evidently  confused  communication  skills  with  pedagogical skills as is clear from the following remark from Student teacher 02:

'Teachers need to have communication skills and the ability to stand in front of other people.' (Line 04, gender undisclosed, March 2021)

Another remarked that the skill to communicate would help them get their message across to students effectively and would assist in explaining some concepts quite easily. Participant responses indicate their ignorance about pedagogy at the beginning of their studies. This statement validates Lortie's (1975)  AoO  that  highlights  this  naïve  view  that  many  students  have  of pedagogical  matters.  The  one-dimensional  understanding  of  communication in  a  teaching  environment  is  also  important  to  note.  The  notion  that communication skills are synonymous with pedagogical skills should be challenged at the onset of teacher-training, and these different skill sets should be developed during their studies and practised during periods of teaching practicum.

Another prominent theme was 'patience'. A participant believed that they had to be patient as it would not help to get angry with the learners

for  not  understanding  the  subject  or  being  rude  and  disruptive  in  the classroom (Student teacher 33, line 31, gender undisclosed, March 2021). The attribute of patience clearly correlates with some sense of pedagogy. Student teacher 18 agreed in stating that:

'Patience is the key in life. You have to be patient at all times with all kinds of learners. It's important, because there are learners who are slower than others, which  means  you  have  to  deal  with  them.'  (Line  09,  gender  undisclosed, March 2021)

The attribute of 'leadership' also emerged from the data analysis. It was interesting to note that participants' explanation of leadership correlates with the level of respect that they expect learners to show them when they enter  schools.  According  to  one  participant,  leadership  skills  in  the classroom will lead to learners being engaged and interested in what is presented (Student 61, line 03, gender undisclosed, March 2021). They see leadership  skills  as  important  because  they  believe  they  will  help  them manage  the  classroom  and  ensure  learning  goals  are  achieved.  Some student teachers seem to think that leadership will automatically constitute a manageable classroom. Student teacher 14 stated:

'Leadership  skills  can  also  be  helpful  in  the  classroom  teachers  will  need  to lead  their  classroom,  keeping  their  learners  engaged  and  interested.  This skill  is  important  because  it  can  help  you  with  managing  the  classroom  and highlighting the importance of upcoming due dates or project goals.' (Line 18, gender undisclosed, March 2021)

Student  teacher  30  agreed  that  leadership  would  facilitate  classroom management but indicated that it may lead to additional responsibilities:

'Teachers require leadership abilities both in and out of the classroom. Modelling behaviour for pupils can help them build a passion for study and a sense of general responsibility. When dealing with teachers and school administrators, leadership is also crucial. Teachers with good leadership qualities may accept additional  responsibilities  such  as  coaching  a  sports  team  or  leading  a particular interest club such as chess or drama. Teachers who have improved their leadership skills are more likely to rise to senior roles such as principal or superintendent and they will be able to manage their classroom.' (Line 24, gender undisclosed, March 2021)

During  the  process  of  pre-professional  identity  formation,  it  would  be important to focus on the characteristics of a good leader and to discuss how  respectful  relationships  ought  to  be  established  in  a  classroom (Botha &amp; Reyneke 2020).

' Adaptability'  emerged  as  a  fourth  strong  theme  in  data  attribute analysis. Participants mentioned the skill to adapt to different contexts and learners, the ability to be flexible in a changing environment, and the ability to  support learners to cope with a changing environment. This concept

might have featured strongly because the participants had been challenged to adapt to constant changes, especially in education, over the past two years  of  the  coronavirus  disease  2019  (COVID-19)  pandemic.  Other attributes  that  were  mentioned  and  linked  to  the  theme  of  adaptability were perseverance and resilience.

## Student teacher 07 stated:

' Adaptability is an orange brick since it refers to me being able to adapt to new environmental changes and the use of technology. I have to be able to change if it is needed.' (Line 08, gender undisclosed, March 2021)

Student 58 linked the attribute of adaptability to their journey of becoming a teacher:

'Lastly,  is  my  father,  Mr  Z  (Red),  who  has  forever  been  showing  skills  of  adaptability in  life  especially  ever  since  covid  started  and  I  know  that  he  amongst  other people he can instil the skill of adaptability in me hence pushing me onwards on my journey to become a teacher.' (Line 25, gender undisclosed, March 2021)

It  is  positive  to  note  that  student  teachers  seem  to  be  aware  of  the importance of these attributes - adaptability and flexibility will serve them well as they start their teaching careers in the ever-changing 21st century. Resilience would be needed to successfully face various challenges linked to  the  profession  and  persevere  when  the  going  gets  tough.  Several students indicated that they see resilience as an important attribute of a teacher.

## Student teacher 10 stated:

'I will need resilience as it allows one to grow and learn in all situations, enables one  to  approach  new  situations  and  people  with  confidence  and  a  positive mindset which will promote success.' (Line 06, gender undisclosed, March 2021)

## Student teacher 60 stated:

' Resilience when teacher is resilience they are able to bounce when a teaching method is not working and they try another one.' (Line 12, gender undisclosed, March 2021)

## Student teacher 42 stated:

'Resilience: when either one my friends faces adversity, they do not let it ruin the day, they keep moving forward. It is what I have come to learn to keep believing in myself even if the day is too tough to handle. I will need to do the same if I am a teacher.' (Line 34, gender undisclosed, March 2021)

Student teacher 42's comments  on resilience correlate with their understanding of perseverance. Student teacher 10 explained it:

' As a teacher you need to instil confidence, build a student's ability to persevere so it is easy for students to deal with failure as they shouldn't be praised for success only but also effort.' (Line 02, gender undisclosed, March 2021)

Student teacher 01 expressed their belief that there will be difficult moments in teaching, but you have to keep going:

'I have to keep going even when you feel there's no hope, there is a light at the end of every tunnel.' (Line 15, gender undisclosed, March 2021)

Participants mentioned other skills and attributes: Learner's needs, class discipline, collaboration, confidence, conflict resolution, consistency, control, critical thinking, dedication, empathy,  fairness, work  ethics, integrity,  caring  and  group  work.  The  mentioning  of  various  skills  and attributes can be linked to first-year student teachers' different backgrounds and experiences. Each student teacher built their tower from their unique perspective of what makes a good teacher. Interestingly enough, first-year student teachers generally focused much more on soft skills than on the cognitive aspects or academic requirements of teaching. This links to the concern that Lortie (1975) and Darling-Hammond and Bransford (2006) had about the influence of the AoO, especially the latter's use of the analogy of the conductor of an orchestra referred to above in making the point that it all looks so simple and easy. While one does not ignore the important role soft skills play in effective teaching, it is apparent from the data analysis that  participants  seem  ignorant  about  the  profession's  cognitive  and pedagogical demands. None of the participants mentioned a high level of content knowledge or the importance of pedagogical knowledge and skills. Neither did they mention any attributes related to handling administrative duties such as creating your own structure, being organised in planning and in record keeping. The picture of a teacher that emerged from the data was one who cared, not necessarily one who is a subject expert or notably skillful in transferring subject knowledge.

Beijaard,  Verloop  and  Vermunt  (2000)  identify  three  components  of teacher identity: Subject matter expert, pedagogical expert and didactic expert. The development of this identity is influenced by teaching content, experience  and  biography.  In  that  regard,  the  self-directed  LEGO®  Six BRICKS activity was used effectively to challenge pre-service teachers to critically  consider  their  biography  and  expose  them  to  the  parts  of professional development they might not yet be aware of. Their responses indicate areas for development.

## Perceptions of important role-players in their journeys of becoming teachers

Students  mostly  commented  on  the  importance  of  relationships,  the availability of resources, knowledge  and  attributes  required  by  the profession. The following section will discuss these perceptions that will influence their pre-professional identity formation.

## Relationships

Participants  commented  on  the  importance  of  relationships  inside  and outside the educational context and referred to people and relationships that  influenced  their  decision  to  study  education  and  relationships  that they think may influence their journey to become teachers.

## Attributes and skills inside the educational context

## Relationships with learners

Based on some participants' experiences and perspectives, they indicated a  heartfelt  wish  to  help  learners  succeed  in  their  lives,  expressed  in statements such as:

'[…] every child needs the right to education, no matter what their circumstances are, and if I can help in achieving this, I want to.' (Student teacher 55, line 04, gender undisclosed, March 2021)

In the same vein, participants remarked on the influence of caring teachers on them and how these relationships contributed to their choice to become teachers. It is important to note that this notion of caring seems to be a defining feature in the pre-professional identity of the participants.

The sense of teaching as a calling was furthermore supported by student teachers placing blocks in their tower that addressed the concept 'to teach is to care'. One participant indicated that they associated the orange LEGO® Duplo® block with caring as it makes them think of the sun and that their role as a teacher will be to care for children (Student teacher 58, line 18, gender  undisclosed,  March  2021).  Student  teacher  26  (line  14,  gender undisclosed, March 2021) stated that:

'[…] education is the most rewarding job on earth if you are a teacher that loves and care for your learnings. You have to make a difference in their lives.'

The idea of loving and caring was also expressed in responses such as:

'Love  is  the  most  important  thing  to  have  as  a  teacher  because  love  brings patience and understanding. It also creates a strong bond between you and your learners. As a teacher, you need to go the extra mile to demonstrate your love and show care to learners, it makes them be motivated and more likely to learn and engage with you.' (Student teacher 51, line 26, gender undisclosed, March 2021)

Once again, the need for soft skills featured strongly, especially in terms of an inclusive and accommodating approach to teaching. However, data on relationships with teachers portrayed some awareness of teachers' content knowledge and pedagogical skills.

## Relationships with former teachers

It  was  evident  from  the  data  analysis  that  former  teachers  played  a significant role in what first-year student teachers believed about teachers and the teaching profession and in their decisions to become teachers. Participants associated their favourite teachers with specific colours:

'My  yellow  brick  is  my  former  accounting  teacher  who  persuaded  me  into choosing this career, with the experience he has, an aspiring teacher like myself can learn a lot from him in terms of knowledge and teaching skills in this field.' (Student teacher 04, line 15, gender undisclosed, March 2021)

'My former Grade 3 teacher is yellow and played a huge role in the journey of my life as I decide to do teaching. She made it look easier, enjoyable and much easier than it may be. She taught me the best and that you should never give up and grab every opportunity that comes your way.' (Student teacher 45, line 34 gender undisclosed, March 2021)

'Green and light blue, my mentor and teacher, Mrs M. She is a blessing to me and showed me how things are and made me choose the best career in my life.  I  learnt a lot from her because she was my early childhood development teacher  that  really  made  me  to  be  the  best  that  I  am.'  (Student  teacher  33, row 23, gender undisclosed, March 2021)

Student teacher 58 (lines 20-29, gender undisclosed, March 2021) chose to assign four of the colours in the set of six blocks to different teachers who greatly  influenced  their  life.  Figure  8.2  provides  a  visual  presentation  of their cube:

'The first role player of my life is my mathematics literacy teacher in high school, Mr S (Light Blue) he is one part of why I am doing teaching right now and it was also his enthusiasm when it came to teaching and other mural activities that have now inspired this skill for me. The other role player in my life has to be my

former life sciences teacher Ms. R (Blue), she had taught us that an organized book leads to an organized life and an organized life leads to great academic success; hence she is an important role player for me. My next role player is my former principal in high school Mr E (Orange), he was also my business teacher and the reason why he's my role player is that he always showed a sense of leadership where ever he went in the school and that showed me how much of a responsible man he is when it came to leading by example to his colleagues and his students and hence I believe that he can instil that same sense of leadership within me. Above all my former teachers in high school, my geography teacher Ms. S (Yellow) who, had the biggest influence on my time management skills, hence she is also a role player in my life. She would always have everything she did have a certain time of completion and it would be just that so I believe that she  can  have  the  biggest  influence  to  my  time  management  skills.'  (Student teacher 58, lines 20-29, gender undisclosed, March 2021)

Other student teachers' comments link to the argument made by Greenwalt (2014, p. 309) that learners will be exposed to various teachers over twelve years of schooling and that it will be highly unlikely that student teachers will  model  their  own  behaviour  on  one  notion  of  teaching  practice. Examples include:

'The green block is my teachers at school. I learned a lot of valuable lessons from them, both positive and negative that I could use in my career as a teacher. I learned what will work for me as a teacher and what not out of my positive and negative experiences in school.' (Student teacher 61, line 25, gender undisclosed, March 2021)

'I  associate red with my teacher who taught me how to manage a class. You need to be strict; it is not as easy as it seems but I will do the same.' (Student teacher 02, line 37, gender undisclosed, March 2021)

This comment confirms the importance of guided reflection (highlighted by  Smagorinsky  &amp;  Barnes  2014,  p.  48)  for  student  teachers  who  must embark on constructing their own pre-professional identity. As discussed earlier,  these  researchers  call  for  pre-service  teachers  to  be  guided  in reflecting  on  both  the  negative  and  positive  impacts  of  their  former teachers so that they are scaffolded in conceptualising a vision for their pedagogical  style  and  professional  identity.  The  play-based  activities proved to be highly effective in this regard.

Participants  also  commented  on  their  relationship  with  the  institution where they enrolled for teacher-training and their relationship with the faculty.

## Relationships with the university and with the faculty

Some participants mentioned the role of the university as a place where student  teachers  hoped  to  gather  knowledge  as  well  as  the  role  of university lecturers. Although most participants did not identify the institution and its staff as role-player, some indicated that the university played a vital role in their journey to becoming teachers. These participants did not place the blocks representing the institution or staff at the base of their cubes but

either in the middle or on top, which indicated that they did not see them as foundational aspects of their journeys of becoming teachers but as roleplayers that should be considered. Student teacher 05 explained:

'On the third brick, the dark blue brick is the university where I am currently studying  and  acquiring  all  the  knowledge,  skills  and  expertise  required  to become a pedagogical practitioner.' (Line 15, gender undisclosed, March 2021)

A statement like this illustrates the realisation that lived experiences as a learner at school alone do not prepare one for the profession. The following response  focused  on  the  qualification  rather  than  the  acquisition  of knowledge and skills:

'Orange stands for university, it is important because it is the only way where I  can  obtain  my  degree  for  teaching.'  (Student  teacher  42,  line  28,  gender undisclosed, March 2021)

Another participant commented on the role to be played by the university in promoting inclusion, social cohesion, and equity:

'Dark blue represents university, I placed it at the top because university is the centre  of  learning  it  is  where  I  gain  substantive  personal  benefits,  including specific skills and capabilities throughout my university life. University will help me  gain  dignity,  it  will  help  me  respect  every  person,  regardless  of  gender, sexual  orientation,  or  gender  diversity.'  (Student  teacher  32,  line  22,  gender undisclosed, March 2021)

## Attributes and skills outside the educational context

The analysis of the qualitative data highlighted the important role-played by the community, family, friends and religion in first-year students' decision to  study  teaching  and  in  supporting  them  in  their  journey  of  becoming teachers.

Student teachers' sense of community relates to their feeling of a calling, as discussed concerning the relationship with learners. Student teacher 57 (line 18, gender undisclosed, March 2021) remarked on the need for change in the community: 'I hope that I will do better and believe that I will bring about change if I become a teacher'.

Another participant associated community with the orange brick and aimed  to  give  back  to  their  community  with  the  skills  they  learnt  at university because the community was supportive in encouraging them to become a qualified teacher (Student teacher 22, line 13, gender undisclosed, March 2021). Student teacher 44 acknowledged the influential role-played by the community when they remarked that:

'[…] the kids from my community helped, by making me realize that teaching is what I want to do by choosing me to help them with their schoolwork.' (Line 22, gender undisclosed, March 2021)

Family played a determining role in some students' decisions to enrol for studies  in  education.  Participants  commented  on  their  families,  ranging from grandparents and parents to siblings and cousins, who supported and motivated them. Some specifically remarked on the fact that their parents or  grandparents  were  teachers.  Student  teacher  24  (line  15,  gender undisclosed, March 2021) stated that both their parents were teachers and did not only motivate them to become a teacher but also guided them in best practices. While the student teacher might appreciate the guidance from their parents, a crucial part of their teacher-training would be to attain a  high  level  of  knowledge  and  skills  so  that  they  will  be  able  to  reflect critically  on  their  parents'  practice  in  the  formation  of  their  own  preprofessional identity.

Some participants who identified the family as an important role-player constructed their cubes with the family brick at the bottom and justified the placement by indicating family support as a foundational aspect. Participants selected different coloured bricks to represent their families and remarked on the lessons learnt from them while growing up. These lessons included being motivated, loving and caring for others, patience, the importance of good  communication,  overcoming  challenges,  taking  responsibility,  not overreacting, good time management, self-confidence, the importance of a wide vocabulary and word choice, enthusiasm and dedication. One student

teacher mentioned their father, who taught their the importance of patience, while another remarked on a cousin who taught them to drive a car in a 'caring  manner'  (Student  teacher  55,  line  27,  gender  undisclosed,  March 2021). These skills, which mostly fall in the category of soft skills, are typically developed in family settings and contribute to forming a pre-professional teacher identity.

Participants also mentioned peers and friends that  form part of their support structure in their journey of becoming teachers:

'My best friend is light blue as he is always by my side. He is ambitious about dreams and believes in me.' (Student teacher 01, line 29, gender undisclosed, March 2021)

'Green symbolises friends - [t]hey provide support and resources. Comparing notes  with  your  friends  you'll  see  what  information  they  believe  is  most important. You can discover new methods of note-taking.' (Student teacher 38, line 34, gender undisclosed, March 2021)

'We need our peers a lot during our journey of becoming teachers and they help us in changing ideas on which we build upon ourselves. Together we gain an understanding of different theories around teaching and without them we would struggle, hence I put them last as they are an important part of my journey of becoming a teacher.' (Student teacher 48, line 24, gender undisclosed, March 2021)

These  remarks  indicate  first-year  student  teachers'  realisation  of  the importance  of  group  work  and  how  they  start  forming  communities  of practice in taking responsibility for their academic progress.

Finally,  student  teachers'  relationship  with  God,  that  is,  their religion , was highlighted as an important role-player. Student teachers often placed religion (together with family) at the base of their LEGO® cube, indicating that religion played an important role in their decision to become teachers and in the type of teacher they wanted to become. Their religion and Bibles guided them to become the best teacher possible:

'My second foundation brick is dark blue, it represents commitment in my faith in God, Man lets you down, but God never breaks His promises. Therefore, I learn how to be committed to my job as a teacher in faith to the children.' (Student teacher 02, line 14, gender undisclosed, March 2021)

'The  Bible  is  my  guide  to  stay  on  the  right  path  when  I  will  be  teaching. Supporting human dignity and love for your fellow man.' (Student teacher 29, line 28, gender undisclosed, March 2021)

'God is my foundation brick as I would not be where I am without God.' (Student teacher 07, line 19, gender undisclosed, March 2021)

It became evident that religion guided the lives of many first-year student teachers and influenced how they saw themselves and the approach they

would have to their studies and the profession. Ultimately their spiritual awareness  and  being  would  influence  their  pre-professional  identity formation.

The next major role-player that participating student teachers commented on was resources.

## Resources

Access to resources, both digital and non-digital, is featured as a prominent theme. This aligns with Marais (2021, p. 171), who indicates that COVID-19 illustrated  that  we  need  teachers  to  create  their  own  resources.  The prominence of resources as a role-player may indicate a general perception among first-year student teachers that one's success as a teacher depends on the availability of resources:

'Dark blue color represents resources. Without resources it will be difficult to teach, so the color shows that with the use of resources there is intelligence as teaching will be easy, so it will give me motive.' (Student teacher 13, line 24, gender undisclosed, March 2021)

This comment shows that for this student teacher, resources may equal intelligence and that resources will motivate the pre-service teachers and make teaching easier.

## Digital resources

Participants indicated that their ability to teach would be shaped by their ability to use digital tools and resources. These include the Internet to find information, a computer to access information and presentation hardware to use while they may be presenting lessons. Student teacher 8 (line 48, gender undisclosed, March 2021) commented that digital resources allowed them  to  explore  varied  learning  experiences  and  familiarise  themselves with different technologies as they are living in the 21st century.

The belief that technology is the cornerstone of teaching may hugely affect  pre-professional  identity  formation.  As  part  of  their  teaching practicum, student teachers should be confronted with the reality of the diverse  educational  landscape  in  South  Africa  -  an  experience  that  will influence  pre-professional  teacher  identity  formation.  As  many  of  them might start their careers at schools with no digital resources, it is important for them to learn how to adapt their pedagogy.

The strong reliance on digital resources may have been influenced by first-year student teachers' experiences during the past two years of the COVID-19 pandemic. During this time, many of them had to rely on access and the ability to use digital resources to learn. Those who enjoyed access

to digital resources could comment on the use and value of digital resources, while those who had to cope in an environment where digital resources were not easily available relied on printed material.

## Non-digital resources

Some participants indicated  that  textbooks  played  an  important  role  in their journey of becoming teachers:

'Textbooks  are  giving  me  the  information  that  I  need  to  teach.'  (Student teacher 02, line 40, gender undisclosed, March 2021)

'I believe that academic excellence is through textbook material and resources that can help me be knowledgeable about the content I want and need.' (Student teacher 16, line 47, gender undisclosed, March 2021)

While the value of both digital and non-digital resources cannot be ignored, it  is  important to evaluate why first-year student teachers may see resources as an important role-player. Their perceptions may once again be based on their  experiences  as  school  learners  where  teaching  and  learning  could have  been  textbook-bound  and  where  assessment  tasks  focused  on regurgitating  what  was  written  in  the  textbook  or  support  material. Considering  an  ever-changing  21st-century  society,  it  is  important  for teachers  in  training  and  for  teachers  in  practice  to  be  self-directed  in lifelong learning to ensure that they are on par with the latest developments in their disciplines and that they contribute to knowledge generation. Apart from the focus on content knowledge, pedagogical knowledge and skills should  continuously  be  developed  and  adapted  as  the  teacher  ensures relevance for learners in specific contexts. It is disconcerting, though, that knowledge of subject content did not feature as an important role-player in teacher-training.

## Content knowledge

Very  few  participants  commented  on  teachers'  need  to  know  their disciplines. Those who mentioned content knowledge equated their former teachers' level of knowledge to good Grade 12 results: 'Light blue represents my Grade 12 results and my hard work' (Student teacher 04, line 13, gender undisclosed, March 2021).

One of the participants that acknowledged the importance of content knowledge shared little or even no understanding of the importance of pedagogical knowledge and skills or of pedagogical content knowledge:

- 'I  believe  knowing  the  subject  I  am  going  to  teach  makes  things  easier  for me and the student as I will be able to glide through content and be able to explain it to learners easily, knowing what the subject is about and the content

of the subject makes teaching very easy.' (Student teacher 54, line 18, gender undisclosed, March 2021)

It  ought to  be  highlighted that teacher-training needs to focus on developing all these knowledge domains (Shulman 1986) that make up the armour of a  successful  teacher.  Each  aspect  plays  an  important  part  in  student teachers' forming of pre-professional identity.

## Reflection on problem-based learning and play-based learning for student engagement and the promotion of self-directed learning skills

These pedagogies can only be reflected from the researchers' perspective because it  was  not  the  purpose  of  the  study  to  evaluate  how  effective the  implementation  of  PBL  and  PoPs  were  from  student  teachers' autoethnographic  perspectives.  However,  the  data  generation  indicates students' active engagement with the task that guided them to unpack and reflect on their perceptions of teachers, the teaching profession and prominent  role-players  in  their  journey  to  become  teachers.  They  were referred to the basic competencies that beginner teachers need once they finish their pre-service training, as stipulated in the MRTEQ, to identify gaps in their understanding. According to Knowles (1975), students' identification of  gaps in their own understanding is the first step in the SDL process. What follows is that students should formulate learning goals to address the gaps that they identified. They should then be able to select resources to meet their learning goals, identify learning strategies and finally, students should evaluate whether they have met their learning goals.

In linking with the problem statement that drove this research, hands-on LEGO®  activities  as  play-based  pedagogies  proved  to  be  successful  in raising first-year students' awareness of their perceptions about important role-players as well as skills and attributes needed for the profession and how  their  perceptions  may  be  misaligned  with  actual  requirements (Petersen &amp; De Beer 2019). Furthermore, as newcomers to the university, first-year students were requested to engage actively with the activities in disseminating knowledge as they embarked on the SDL process.

## Conclusion

In this chapter, the authors reflected on the use of LEGO® Six BRICKS as a hands-on tool within a play- and problem-based approach to disrupt firstyear  education  students'  AoO  and  foster  SDL  skills.  As  a  first  step,  this endeavour aimed to raise first-year education students' awareness of the

perceptions of teachers and the teaching profession they bring to training. By requesting participants to construct and photograph their cubes before engaging  them  in  writing  narratives,  the  researchers  aimed  to  promote critical reflection so that students would be able to identify possible gaps in  their  understanding.  This  is  the  start  of  the  SDL  process  that  should result in students' being more receptive to formal teacher-training and the progressive development  of  their professional identity. Creating an awareness of  the  pre-professional  identity,  informed  by  the  AoO,  offers space  for  growth  and  development  in  other  facets  of  professional development. The findings validate the enhancement of communication skills,  problem-solving abilities and personal reflection, not only on their choice to become teachers but also in conceptualising the kind of teacher they wish to be.

The data also highlight that student teachers are strongly influenced by several aspects and role-players ranging from family and former teachers to  their  experiences  in  the  classroom.  Using  LEGO®  Six  BRICKS  in  this research  emphasises  that  identity  is  not  static  and  linear  but  that  the journey  to  becoming  a  teacher  is  dynamic,  multi-faceted  and  can,  like LEGO®, be constructed, deconstructed and reconstructed in various ways. This argument is also true for the maturation of the professional identity. As teacher trainers guide student teachers to develop, reflect and grow, they learn and adapt. The outcomes indicate that although participants share certain perceptions, developing a teacher's professional identity is a personal and contextual matter dependent on SDL and personal reflection.

## Abstract

As English is the language of learning and teaching (LoLT) in South African classrooms, without it,  necessarily  being  learners'  first  (mother-tongue), second or sometimes even third language, teaching pedagogies need to

How to cite: Nordgaard, C, Reyneke, M &amp; Olivier, L 2023, 'Impact of drama-based pedagogy on selfdirected  learning  skills  and  motivation  in  Grade  12  English  Home  Language  learners',  in  M  Havenga, J Olivier &amp; BJ Bunt (eds.), Problem-based learning and pedagogies of play: Active approaches towards Self-Directed Learning , NWU Self-Directed Learning Series, vol. 11, AOSIS Books, Cape Town, pp. 191-214. https:/ /doi.org/10.4102/aosis.2023.BK409.09

be found that can bridge the gap between learners' Home Language (HL) and  the  LoLT.  Direct-teaching  and  teacher-centred  pedagogies  are  no longer conducive to maximising learners' intake or production of a language and do not account for the development of self-directed learning (SDL) skills and motivation to learn (MtL), two very important aspects of language learning. Thus, a more 'inclusive' pedagogy, the drama-based pedagogy (DBP), was used to teach poetry as 'sample content' in the English Home Language (EHL) classroom to measure its impact on Grade 12 learners' SDL skills and MtL. This was done with a mixed-method research design which included pre- and post-DBP exposure SDL tests as the quantitative component of the study, as well as pre- and post-DBP exposure focusgroup interviews, and observations, as the qualitative components of the study. The study's findings illustrated that challenging learners by expecting them to solve the problem of poetry analysis through critical engagement and drama-based activities positively affected both Grade 12 learners' SDL skills and MtL.

## Introduction

This chapter introduces the problem that this research aimed to solve, the theoretical framework of the study in which the problem that inspired this research will be outlined, and the potential for the use of DBP to develop learners' SDL skills and MtL is justified. After that, the research design and analysis are explained with a discussion on the application of these and the results of the study, as well as a conclusion that defends the practicality of using DBP in the language classroom.

South African secondary school learners experience two challenges at a private school in the Gauteng province. Firstly, South African classrooms reflect  that  English  is  studied  as  a  HL  when  it  is  sometimes  not  even learners'  third  or  fourth  language  (Van  der  Walt  &amp;  Evans  2019).  The situation is exacerbated by the fact that learners receive little to no input in  the  target  language  (English,  in  this  case)  outside  of  the  classroom setting  because  many  live  in  African  language-dominated  areas  where they use a variety of African languages to interact socially (Grosser &amp; Nel 2013,  p.  9).  This  essentially  means,  contradictorily,  that  learners  are learning EHL without it being their HL. Van der Walt and Evans (2019, p.  17)  expound this to the fact that the language is seen as the lingua franca and valued for the opportunities it may provide learners with after secondary  education,  as  opposed  to  its  practicality  or  usefulness  in various South African sectors. Considering this reflection of South African EHL classrooms, Grade 12 learners may have below-average capabilities in the  EHL  subject,  which  could  seriously  hamper  their  academic achievement  not  only  due  to  challenges  such  as  'limited English

proficiency' (lEp) (Monyai 2010, p. iv) but also due to their lack of MtL and their inability to take responsibility for their own learning. Both formerly mentioned aspects (MtL and SDL) are essential in aiding learners to cope with an increase in academic workload, make academic progress, equip them with lifelong learning habits and prepare them for real-life demands (Guglielmino 2013; Mentz &amp; Van Zyl 2018).

Secondly,  South  African  teachers  predominantly  use  direct-teaching methods that support a test-driven culture (Berry 2011, p. 98). Good scores in high-stakes tests and examinations, such as the South African Department of Basic Education's (DBE) National Senior Certificate (NSC), come at the price of active and critical learner engagement and the development of higher-order thinking skills (HoTS) in preparation for tertiary studies or the world of work (Berry 2011; Faizah et al. 2021).

In the language classroom, the literature study is particularly suitable for promoting HoTS, language proficiency, and active and critical engagement of learners via alternative pedagogies (Hellemann 2022).

## Literature study as part of language curricula

According to Widdowson (1975, p. 1), the principal aim of literature study is to develop the capacity for individual response to language use. Widdowson (1975, p. 3) argues  that  developing  this  capacity  to  convey  unique interpretations depends on awareness of literary discourse. Collie and Slater (1990,  p.  3)  agree  with  Widdowson  that  the  study  of  literature  plays  an important part in language enrichment and in promoting personal learner involvement and add that literature texts are valuable, authentic material that provide cultural enrichment. Gillian (1999) believes that when learners are exposed to the rich language of a good literature text, it expands their awareness of the target language and their overall knowledge of word and grammar use. Furthermore, the complex, universal themes that literary texts present can encourage confidence and imaginative reflection about their own experience versus that of the writers living in different societies (Li &amp; Fan 2019, p. 36). In linking with the argument of literature study serving the purpose of cultural enrichment, Hişmanoğlu (2005, p. 53) argues that not only is literature a tool for developing written and oral skills in the target language, but it serves as a window through which learners get to investigate the culture of the target language to construct their cultural competence. One can thus conclude that if literature is taught in a learner-centred way at the  secondary  school  level,  it  can  play  a  significant  role  in  encouraging learners' SDL skills and MtL, which, in turn, will enable learners to take on a higher workload and work independently via self-motivation at tertiary and professional levels (Mentz &amp; Van Zyl 2018).

Teaching  in  a  learner-centred  way  to  develop  independent  thinking becomes  crucially  important  with  the  study  of  poetry,  which  is  often regarded as 'the most sophisticated genre of literature, comprising a variety of contents that are narrative, lyrical and dramatic in nature' (Syed &amp; Wahas 2020,  p.  189).  The  study  of  poetry  becomes  more  problematic  when students lack proficiency in the target language. The South African DBE's Curriculum and Assessment Policy Statement (CAPS) for EHL (DBE 2011a, p. 14) acknowledges that it is never easy to teach literature and states that it can only successfully be done when learners are actively engaging with texts and invited to share their personal, thoughtful and honest interpretations. This implies that caution should be taken when teachers project their own interpretations of literary texts onto learners and rather create opportunities for meaningful learner participation. Because interpretation is subjective, every learner should be encouraged to search for meaning and feel safe to share their views and understanding.

The purpose of teaching poetry as a genre (DBE 2011a) and individual poems as creative texts is to:

[ S ]how  learners how  language  can  be  used  with  subtlety, intelligence, imagination, and flair. This means taking a close look at how text is created, manipulated, and re-arranged to clarify and emphasise what is being expressed. Such work might involve examining the presence or absence of imagery; what kind of imagery is being selected by the writer and why; sentence structures and paragraphing, or the layout of poems; choice of words, continuing motifs through  the  text;  the  use  of  symbol,  sound,  and  colour  where  appropriate. A whole text means something, not just bits and pieces of it. (p. 14)

Therefore, pedagogies involving line-by-line text analysis should be avoided (Pushpa &amp; Seyed 2014). In an examination-driven system where learners are coached to pass with good marks (Jordaan 2015, p. 154), they might find themselves ill-prepared for the demands of tertiary education and the world of work after secondary education because of a lack of SDL skills and meaningful learner engagement, as found in Strydom's (2019) study on the self-directedness of first-year university students. Thus, alternative pedagogies, such as DBP, which promotes SDL through active, meaningful learner engagement, should be emphasised better to prepare learners for their future after secondary education.

## Drama-based pedagogy

It is important to note that while there is some overlap between the CAPS subject Dramatic Arts (DA) and the application of DBP to the language classroom,  such  as  novel  and  play  study,  these  are  two  completely different concepts. Dramatic Arts, 'prepared learners for entry into further studies  for  a  possible  career[s]  in  the  drama  (or  related  arts)  field' (Ackerman 2021), as learners learn to express themselves with the use of

props, lighting, breathing and articulation, among other DA aspects, to perform in front of an audience or on stage (DBE 2011b, p. 9).

On the other hand, DBP is described by Patall et al. (2015, p. 4) as 'a collection  of  drama-based  teaching  and  learning  strategies  to  engage students in learning' and is not necessarily for performance in front of an audience. Thus, the emphasis is not on learners' ability to develop and use performative skills but rather on how integrating drama into the classroom can aid learners in becoming more engaged in their learning and developing meaningful skills that might increase their academic ability. In support, Van Heerden and Veldsman (eds. 2021, p. 78) emphasise that incorporating DBP into classrooms can 'foster social skills, critical thinking, communication and comprehension skills, integrate knowledge and expand [learners'] horizons'. Drama-based activities, or 'conventions' as Baldwin (2015) calls them, can provide the teacher and their learners with a unique way to explore complex concepts and themes related to literature being studied. For example, Van Heerden and Veldsman (eds. 2021, p. 78) explain that using role-play, a wellknown drama-based activity in which learners act 'in role' as friends sharing a  sandwich,  could  teach  learners  something  as  complex  as  compassion. Thereafter, the activity might be 'tweaked slightly' to explore themes such as poverty which might be a prominent theme in the learners' CAPS-prescribed setworks. Drama-based pedagogy is also versatile as it can be utilised for both language-based subjects and content-based subjects, such as Biology (Life Sciences) and History (Patall et al. 2015, p. 4).

However, the benefits of using DBP in language education have been realised for more than three decades (Dunn &amp; Stinson 2011). Some of these benefits, both general and language-specific, are highlighted by Kobayashi (2012, p. 30) and Uysal and Yavuz (2018, pp. 377-378):

- · measured an increase in learners' confidence and creativity.
- · promotes cooperative learning (CL) and, as a consequence, trust and acceptance.
- · are supportive learner autonomy.
- · encourages authentic language use.
- · learnt new vocabulary through rote repetition new vocabulary.
- · noted an increase in learners' motivation because of their heightened confidence using and interacting with the target language in a fun and interesting way.

Furthermore,  DBP  can  be  used  in  collaboration  with  language  learning theories, such as Vygotsky's (1978) social-constructivist theory (SCT) and the reader-response theory (RRT), as well as the approaches suggested in the CAPS for EHL Grades 10-12 (DBE 2011a) for teaching languages: The communicative  approach,  text-based  approach  and  process  approach. This  is  because  DBP  requires  the  teacher  to  adopt  a  facilitative  role  in learners' language learning and exploration. Additionally, both Vygotsky's

(1978)  SCT  and  the  RRT  acknowledge  the  learner  and  their  social background as part of the learning process, as the former theory considers the learner's socio-cultural background as the basis from which they make meaning in language learning, and the latter theory considers the learner's experiences as part of the process when making meaning of a text while reading.  The  RRT,  in  particular,  is  described  by  its  original  theorist, Rosenblatt (1978), as a 'transaction'. Amer (2003, p. 68) simply explains that this 'transaction' is the ability of the reader to make meaning of a text through self-contraction, using one's own beliefs, values, expectations, and assumptions to reflect on and create their understanding of a text. Spirovska (2019, p. 23) further elaborates that in this way, the reader has the ability to change the text (based on who they are) and shares a similar role to the author of the text in terms of designing the text's intended message.

Either way, acknowledging the learner as part of the learning process is extremely important, especially when making use of the DBP, as dramabased  activities  are  not  meaningful  if  they  do  not  relate  to  real-life examples  and  learners  cannot  express  their  real-life  lived  experiences (Patall et al. 2015, p. 4). Thus, the teacher has to be able to relinquish their role  as  the  sole  information  giver  and  allow  for  learners'  expression  of their ideas in an authentic way in order for them to realise the benefits of making use of the DBP in the language classroom. Moreover, making use of DBP has the capacity to develop HoTS such as evaluation and analysis, which are not only skills of a self-directed learner but are also used in the learning  of  poetry  because  learners  are  placed  in  the  context  of  the literature they are studying (Romylos 2020, p. 11). As a poetry-specific example: Learners are  required  to  study  a  poem  in  which  the  speaker expresses their grief about the passing of a loved one. Writing 'in role', learners might write a diary entry from the perspective of the speaker of the poem after the teacher has scaffolded the context and content of the poem. The benefits of this type of drama-based activity are twofold: (1) the development of analysis skills, as learners are required to analyse the poem with regards to, for example, diction use, imagery and message, and (2) the development of writing skills. This example also illustrates the adaptive nature of DBP and its relative activities. To better understand DBP's adaptability, Table 9.1 explains the mechanics of each drama-based activity selected for the poems used in this study. However, it is important to note that many other drama-based activities have not been mentioned in this study (cf. Baldwin 2015).

Despite this short list of adaptive and interesting drama-based activities, teachers often marginalise using poetry as a promotional tool to increase learners' 'linguistic and cultural knowledge' (Gönen 2018) and teach it the same way they were taught: line-by-line analysis (Gönen 2018). Pushpa and Seyed (2014) emphasise how unfortunate this is, as poetry can increase

## Drama-based activity Explanation of activity's mechanics

| Performance  carousel   | Learners perform a very short scene from a text in groups. All groups have the  same amount of time to perform (30 s to 1 min, for example) and must freeze as  soon as their scene has been performed so that the next group knows when to  begin their performance. Once the entire class, or all groups, have performed,  the class 'melts' to the floor the same way a carousel might slow in motion and  then stop when switched off. Alternatively, each group might 'melt' to the ground  in  slow  motion  after  their  performance,  and  once  completely  seated  and  still,  the next group may begin their presentation. Used for poetry, a teacher might  allocate a stanza to each group and facilitate its brainstorming until each group is  ready to dramatise each stanza of the poem after the other.   |

| Sculpting               | In a group of learners, a 'sculptor' is chosen to 'mould' the other group members  into a still image that captures the essence, theme or subject of a section of text  or scene. The sculptor might verbally direct other group members or physically  'mould'  them  into  a  certain  position.  In  the  activity's  application  to  poetry,  teachers might allocate a stanza or line of poetry to a group. By the end of the  activity, the entire poem can be viewed as some kind of 'sculpture gallery'.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

learners' motivation to communicate  in  the target language  when discussing, for example, the poem's theme. Thus, the adaptability of DBP has the capacity to develop learners' MtL, which can make all the difference in  language  teaching  and  learning,  and,  subsequently,  their  SDL  skills (Tohidi et al. 2019, p. 26).

## Self-directed learning

A well-known definition of SDL is provided by Knowles (1975; cf. ch. 1 of this book):

A process in which individuals take the initiative, with or without the help of others, in diagnosing their learning needs, formulating learning goals, identifying human  and  material  resources  for  learning,  choosing  and  implementing appropriate learning strategies, and evaluating learning outcomes'. (p. 18)

Knowles  (1975)  further  provides  the  following  characteristics,  among others, of a self-directed learner:

- · Sets clear learning goals.
- · Self-monitors their own learning process.

- · Evaluates the outcomes of their own learning.
- · Works autonomously.
- · Self-motivates.
- · Is curious.
- · Learns by taking the initiative.

These characteristics are aligned with both what the CAPS (DBE 2011a, p.  14)  envisions  for  the  study  of  poetry  and  the  mentioned  benefits  of integrating  DBP  into  the  language  classroom.  However,  SDL  skills  and characteristics cannot be developed 'instantly' but are rather, according to Grow (1991, p. 130), developed in stages. Grow's (1991) model of SDL is as follows:

- · Stage  1: Little  to  no  SDL  skills  can  be  observed  in  the  learners  and learners are over-reliant on the teacher as the sole information giver.
- · Stage 2: SDL skills can be observed generally, as learners are open to the idea of being motivated and guided through learning activities.
- · Stage  3: Teacher  facilitates  group  discussion  in  which  learners  are involved and are active 'role-players' in their own learning. Some learners might even conduct their own research and augment their own learning.
- · Stage  4: Teacher  acts  as  a  consultant  while  learners  identify  and coordinate their own learning goals as they are entirely self-directed.

As a result of the test-driven culture of South African classrooms (Jordaan 2015), it might be that learners may only be in Stage 1 of Grow's (1991) SDL model. Motivation also plays an integral role in learners developing SDL skills  (Beckers,  Dolmans  &amp;  Van  Merriënboer  2016).  At  Stage  2,  teachers motivate learners to believe in their own capabilities to reach their learning goals.  Thus,  South  African  learners  may  develop  or  display  the  characteristics of a self-directed learner mentioned by Knowles (1975) before should the teacher acknowledge that increasing learners' MtL is a significant part of developing learners' SDL skills. To start this process, however, one way to identify the SDL stage that learners might be in is to task learners with completing Williamson's (2007) self-rating scale of self-directed learning (SRSSDL) questionnaire, which was used for this study. The correlations between this questionnaire and both DBP and MtL can be found in some of the questionnaire's twelve categories:

- · I  consider  teachers  as  facilitators  of  learning  rather  than  providing information only, I can maintain self-motivation. (Awareness area)
- · I participate in group discussions, I find 'role-play' is a useful method for complex  learning,  I  find  interactive  teaching-learning  sessions  more effective than just listening to lectures. (Learning strategies area)
- · Interacting  with  others  helps  me  develop  the  insight  to  plan  further learning. (Interpersonal skills area)
- · I keep an open mind to others' point of view. (Learning activities area)

Drama-based pedagogy may be conducive to developing learners' SDL skills and MtL because of these connections. Another important aspect of SDL, however, is reflection (Kemp, Baxa &amp; Cortes 2022), as learners need to be able to reflect on their process of learning with reference to achieve their learning goals. Therefore, the researchers decided to add a reflection aspect to the drama-based activities in which learners were asked to reflect on other groups' presentations, where necessary, and communicate how they felt other groups dramatised certain stanzas of the poems used for this  study.  Drama-based  pedagogy,  therefore,  creates  opportunities  for learners to engage in SDL to gain more confidence in their ability to make meaning  of  texts  and  to  apply  new  knowledge  when  confronted  with analysing new texts.

This  study  focused  on  Grade  12  EHL  learners  who  are  challenged  to study English literature at the HL level, while English is not their HL. Being confronted  by  the  problem  of  making  sense  of  prescribed  poems,  this study aimed to determine the impact of DBP on the promotion of SDL and MtL in Grade 12 EHL learners.

## Research design

A  mixed-method  design  was  chosen  as  it  provides  a  more  complete understanding of the data related to the research questions and problems instead  of  using  singular  designs  such  as  the  qualitative  or  quantitative approaches on their own (Wisdom &amp; Creswell 2013). This 'more complete understanding' that the mixed-method design provides is attributed to the fact  that  the  intention  is  to  find  multilateral  relationships  between  the qualitative and quantitative data (Smith &amp; Shorten 2017, p. 74). Thus, this design is fitting for this study as the researchers intended to identify and report on the relationships between DBP, SDL skills and MtL in Grade 12 EHL learners. Thus, a convergent parallel design was used to measure the impact  of  DBP  on  Grade  12  EHL  learners'  SDL  skills  and  MtL,  as  the qualitative data and quantitative data were collected simultaneously to be combined later (Edmonds &amp; Kennedy 2017, p. 181).

The  study's  quantitative  data,  Williamson's  (2007)  SRSSDL,  were collected  at  the  same  time  as  the  study's  qualitative  data,  which  were focus-group  interviews  and  observations.  However,  both  were  repeated and collected twice. Once before, the learners were exposed to dramabased activities related to the poems selected for the study and prescribed in the Grade 12 CAPS curriculum, and once after learners' exposure to DBP. This was done as a pre- and post-process before and after a five-week EHL class  attendance  period  in  which  the  learners  engaged  in  drama-based activities relative to the following prescribed poems from Imagined Worlds: An Anthology of Poetry (eds. McIntyre, Olivier &amp; Varga 2015) - 19 selected

by the South African Independent Examination Board (IEB): Performance carousel for  'Nightsong  City'  by  Dennis  Brutus, sculpting for  'T ouch'  by Hugh Lewin, essence machine for 'Portrait of a Loaf of Bread' by Mbuyiseni Oswald  Mshali  and choral  verse for  'The  Cry  of  South  Africa'  by  Olive Schreiner.

These poems and the drama-based activities assigned to them were selected after the researchers analysed the texts regarding their specific forms,  figurative  language,  diction  and  messages,  among  other  poetic devices, and chose drama-based activities to help the learners understand the poems better. For example, in the poem 'The Cry of South Africa' by Olive Schreiner, the line 'Give back my dead!' is repeated and emphasised using the exclamation mark. Thus, choral verse (speaking in unison) seemed the most appropriate option for this poem, as it would aid the learners in understanding the angry tone of the speaker, especially while speaking in unison and screaming the line 'Give back my dead!', as opposed to a passive drama-based activity such as writing-in-role. Furthermore, other prescribed poems selected by the IEB for 2022 included, for example, 'Ulysses' by Alfred Tennyson. Considering the length of the poem (70 lines) and the historical context based on Greek mythology, this poem would take time to analyse  and  assign  a  drama-based  activity  because  of  the  limited  EHL periods  and  other  EHL  content  that  needs  to  be  taught  (Shakespeare, novel study, etc.). Nevertheless, these pre- and post-practices were done to measure the impact of DBP on Grade 12 learners' SDL skills and MtL, as the data were first  analysed  separately  and  then  later  combined  to  identify relationships between the qualitative and quantitative methods. The impact was measured through an analysis of the study's results in which learners developed skills related to DBP, SDL skills and an increase in their MtL.

## Methodology

Within the mixed-method research design, pragmatism underpinned the research paradigm because it accounts for the use of both qualitative and quantitative  methods  and  rejects  the  idea  of  using  one  method,  either qualitative or quantitative methods, separately. This is because, when using both  qualitative  and  quantitative  methods  simultaneously,  the  focus  is shifted from the data collection method, as with qualitative or quantitative research  designs,  to  the  research  problem  (Creswell  2003;  Frey  2018). Thus, pragmatism was suited to the study, as both quantitative (SRSSDL pre-  and  post-test  questionnaire)  and  qualitative  (pre-  and  post-focusgroup interviews) were used. Furthermore, to achieve triangulation in the study, the researchers conducted structured observations via spot checks during the learners' engagement in drama-based activities to support the data  collection  process  and  ensure  the  reliability  of  the  findings.  As  a

reference point to the reader, Williamson's (2007) SRSSDL questionnaire was used to measure the Grade 12 EHL learners' SDL skills before and after exposure  to  DBP  through  poetry  teaching  and  learning,  and  the  focusgroup interviews (for which learners were divided into groups of five) were used to identify learners' perception of their MtL before and after exposure to DBP through poetry.

## Sampling and data analysis

Non-probability  purposive  sampling  was  chosen  for  the  study,  which  is used by researchers that have a particular purpose in mind for the study (Maree &amp; Pietersen 2016, p. 197). Thus, the participants (20 in total) had to meet certain criteria, such as being in their last year of secondary school (Grade 12) and taking EHL, for the researchers to identify the impact of DBP on Grade 12 EHL learners' SDL skills and MtL. However, the members for  the  focus-group  interviews  (five  per  group)  and  each  drama-based activity were selected randomly to observe and receive a true reflection of the learners' behaviours, thoughts and feelings that were not influenced by being  in  groups  with  their  friends.  The  learners  gave  informed  consent to participate.

As aforementioned, both Williamson's (2007) questionnaire and the focus-group  interviews  were  analysed  before  and  after  the  learners' exposure to DBP. They were compared to indicate any change in the Grade  12  EHL  learners'  SDL  skills  and  MtL  because  they  engaged  in drama-based  activities.  However,  the  quantitative  data  (SRSSDL  preand post-questionnaires) were processed by a qualified statistician at the North-West University (NWU) to identify the learners' level of SDL before and after their exposure to DBP, as well as the reliability of the questionnaire, among other things later discussed in the 'Discussion of findings' section of this chapter.

Oppositely,  the  focus-group  interviews  were  recorded,  transcribed verbatim and uploaded into ATLAS.ti™ (Version 8.3.1, Scientific Software Development GmbH) by the researchers. They then assigned self-created codes inductively (identified from the data) to the data to identify common themes  and  relationships  between  the  data  and  answer  the  research questions. Finally, for the structured observations as the final aspect for the triangulation of the data, the researchers made notes during the learners' engagement with the drama-based activities at random times (spot checks) so  that  learners  were  caught  unawares,  and  the  researchers  could  truly reflect on their behaviour during the drama-based activities. Spot checks were also conducted as the researchers themselves facilitated the dramabased activities. According to Grow's (1991) model, notes were made about the stages of SDL that the learners were in from the first activity to the last.

This meant that the researchers had to have predetermined questions to guide the structured observation process. For example:

- · Which words, actions and gestures contribute to the learners' level of engagement with the drama-based activities?
- · Is much help asked for during the activities? How does this contribute to identifying which stage of Grow's (1991) SDL model the learners are in?
- · Are there aspects relative to the study's theoretical framework present? For example, the SCT, the communicative approach, et cetera?
- · Which words, actions and gestures suggest the stage of Grow's (1991) model the learners are in?

The notes made in response to these questions were then cross-referenced to the data collected from the focus-group interviews, and finally with the results of the SDL questionnaires to answer the study's primary research question: What is the impact of DBP on Grade 12 EHL learners' MtL and SDL skills ? However, the 'Discussion of findings' section will discuss all three of these data collection methods and their findings.

## Discussion of findings

## Learners' level of engagement with drama activities through classroom observations

While the researchers were observing the learners' level of engagement with  the  drama  activities  during  the  classroom  observations,  they appeared to enjoy the activities truly. They did not seem to be intimidated or overwhelmed by the activities at all. Most participants were observed to  be  slightly  unsure  about  the  first  activity,  but  their  confidence  to engage in the drama-based activities increased from the first to the last. The learners were observed to be smiling, laughing, gesturing animatedly and sharing ideas, which reinforced the idea that DBP '[…] fosters  [learners']  social  skills,  critical  thinking,  communication,  and comprehension  skills'  (eds.  Van  Heerden  &amp;  Veldsman  2021,  p.  78)  and 'focus on process-oriented and reflective experiences' (Patall et al. 2015, p. 4). Thus, for the learners to achieve the objective of the drama-based activity, they were required to think critically and communicate their ideas to their group members who in turn then had to reflect on the shared ideas and follow a procedure to 'get the job done'. Furthermore, Vygotsky's SCT and the RRT were prevalent in the observations. This is illustrated through the following example:

The activity assigned to the poem 'Nightsong City' by Dennis Brutus was a  performance  carousel.  This  required  the  learners  to  create  actions  and movements that represented the stanza and its lines (and poetic devices)

which were assigned randomly to each group. 'the harbour lights glaze over restless docks' is what the second line of the poem reads, and the group given the stanza including this line decided to assign one learner to represent the 'restless docks' an another to represent the 'harbour lights'. The learner representing the 'restless docks' rested on her haunches and swayed from left to right like a ship swaying on the ocean, while the learner representing the  'harbour  lights'  stuck  her  arms  out  in  front  of  her  and  made  waving motions  with  them  from  left  to  right.  Learners  not  included  in  this demonstration were asked to reflect on the images portrayed in front of them and comment on whether the demonstration reflected the line of the poem included in the group-assigned stanzas. This reflection process was done during each activity, as it is a significant step in developing the learners' SDL skills (Kemp et al. 2022). The reflection process led one learner, not included in the demonstration, to ask what the learner representing the boat was supposed to symbolise. When it was revealed that she was attempting to represent a boat to illustrate 'the restless docks', the former learner shared that she would not have done it in the same way but could now see how the learner representing the boat was trying to illustrate the 'restless docks' in the poem.

This  reflection  process  indicated  to  the  researchers  (as  observers) that  the  learners  relied  on  their  social  and  cultural  background  to make  meaning  of  the  world  around  them  but  also  learnt  from  each other by interacting in social contexts, which supported Vygotsky's SCT. Furthermore, the RRT was included in the demonstration, as the dramabased activity included the reader and their interpretation of the content they read. Characteristics from both Kobayashi's (2012, p. 30) and Uysal and Yavuz's (2018, pp. 377-378) reasons for using DBP in the language classroom were also observed; specifically, increase in creativity, confidence, non-competitive group participation, communication of ideas through authentic use of English, and inclusion and use of language skills such as reading, writing, reading and speaking.

Regarding  learners'  MtL,  it  was  observed  to  increase  from  the  first activity to the last. While the learners appeared unsure and apprehensive about  the  first  activity,  their  excitement  for  each  drama-based  activity increased. This was because of both internal motivational factors, such as drive  or  self-motivation  (intrinsic  motivation)  and  external  motivational factors, such as parental interest in academics and teacher encouragement (extrinsic motivation). This increase in MtL because of the use of DBP is later supported by the verbatim quotes from the focus-group interviews in which learners mention that they were motivated by a general appreciation for the activity, the learning of poetry in a new and exciting way, and to avoid direct-teaching methods and the usual classroom setting.

Finally, regarding learners' SDL skills, the researchers observed that they took the initiative and were self-motivated in their engagement with dramabased activities. With specific reference to Grow's (1991) stages of SDL, the learners appeared to be in Stage 1 of Grow's SDL stages as they were overreliant on the teacher to give explicit direction for their actions and exposed their  test-driven nature as they were looking for a 'right way' to do the activity.  However,  because  the  DBP  calls  for  the  teacher  to  assume  a facilitative role, the teacher facilitated the learners' learning and encouraged them to explore their ideas and use their critical thinking skills and creativity. This stance, opposite to direct-teaching methods where the teacher is the sole information provider, appeared to encourage learners to move from Stage  1  of  Grow's  (1991)  SDL  stages  to  Stage  2,  as  they  were  'open  to motivation  and  guidance  from  the  teacher'.  Thereafter,  and  through engaging in more drama-based activities, the learners moved into Stage 3 of Grow's (1991) SDL model because they only needed slight facilitation from the teacher and, perhaps for the first time in poetry learning, enjoyed themselves immensely. Stage 4, the final stage of Grow's (1991) SDL model, was achieved in the last few drama-based activities, as the teacher had only to consult with the learners in their groups about their coordinated learning goals. However, the progression through these four stages is better explained through the focus-group interview sections described hereafter.

## Focus-group interviews: Pre-exposure to dramabased activities

This step of analysing the data required the researchers first to understand the learners' perception of the EHL subject and its use in their daily lives, what motivated or demotivated their MtL in the EHL subject,  and  then more specifically, their perception of poetry teaching and learning before engaging  in  drama-based  activities.  This  offered  the  researchers  an interesting view of how the learners had experienced EHL teaching and learning up until that point and to justify the use of DBP in the language classroom.

## Participants' perceptions of English Home Language and its relevance to their lives

What the focus-group interview data indicated after being uploaded and analysed through Atlas.ti™ (version 8.3.1, Scientific Software Development GmbH) (qualitative data analysis software) that participants used English for different reasons, such as (1) career opportunities, (2) communication, (3) practical use (such as the writing of emails) and (4) because it is the lingua  franca .  Furthermore,  participants  mentioned  that  they  were  both

intrinsically and extrinsically motivated to study English. Intrinsic motivation was based on the desire to achieve professional or career goals, the inner drive  to  achieve  good  marks  and  a  general  interest  in  or  enjoyment  of subject content. Participants were extrinsically motivated as they feared failure  or  the  lack  of  job  opportunities  as  a  result  of  below-average assessment  marks,  and  because  of  passionate  teachers  and  interesting teaching strategies, meeting parents' expectations and perceived benefits such as high-paying careers. However, with regard to the EHL subject, they mentioned more negative reasons that affected their MtL in EHL rather than how it was encouraged or increased. Thus, Figure 9.1 indicates the learners' loss of motivation for the EHL subject, as opposed to their reasons for the support and encouragement of their MtL.

According to  Figure  9.1,  representational  of  the  learners'  words  from their focus-group interviews, the negative reasons for their loss of MtL in the EHL subjects include (1) the difficulty of set work (novels and poetry) and tasks, (2) limited writing skills, (3) direct-teaching methods, (4) the challenge of using HoTS (such as Bloom's evaluation), (5) irrelevance of subject content, (6) incorrect interpretation (of poetry, for example) and (7) the performance related to the maintaining good academic results. As more negative factors were mentioned than positive ones, this indicates that there needs to be a significant change in how the EHL subject is taught, especially considering that most of these negative factors seem to indicate, as aforementioned, that teaching is examination-driven. This is supported by  the  negative  factors  mentioned,  such  as  direct-teaching  methods, cognitive levels, assessment and performance, irrelevant subject material

and incorrect interpretation. Thus, there is a disconnect between participants  and  subject  material  as  everything  is  learnt  to  achieve  the ultimate  goal:  to  pass  Grade  12.  This  is  in  no  way  conducive  to  lifelong learning and the development of SDL skills necessary for either tertiary education or the world of work after secondary school. Furthermore, as can be observed in Figure 9.1, the factors mentioned that are conducive to the learners' MtL in the EHL subject are CL or group work and passionate teachers or interesting teaching strategies. Drama-based  pedagogy accounts  for  both,  as  the  pedagogy  links  with  PBL  that  considers  the learner  part  of  the  meaning-making  process  (Kobayashi  2012;  Uysal  &amp; Yavuz  2018),  includes  collaborative  learning  and  promotes  learning  of content and the development of thinking skills. These mentioned benefits will encourage and develop learners' SDL skills and MtL, as they will become more  confident  in  their  language  use  (thus  increasing  their  MtL)  and become more independent in their learning (thus an increase in SDL skills). However,  learners'  perception  of  poetry  teaching  and  learning  was  of specific importance, which is discussed hereafter.

## Poetry teaching and learning in the English Home Language subject

Like  participants'  perception  of  the  EHL  subject,  more  negative  factors than  positive  factors  were  mentioned  that  affected  their  MtL  poetry  as indicated in Figure 9.2.

The negative factors included in Figure 9.2 mirror most of the negative factors discussed for the EHL subject, namely: (1) the complexity of poems and related tasks, (2) direct-teaching methods, (3) the challenge for higher-

order  thinking  (such  as  evaluation),  (4)  irrelevance  of  subject  content, (5)  incorrect  interpretation  (related  to  poetry)  and  (6)  interpretation discouragement.  Once  more,  this  figure  represents  learners'  inability  to connect with and appreciate subject material and lack of enjoyment when having to learn. Especially relevant to the appreciation of poetry and the comprehension of the poet's message to answer examination questions, for example, is the ability to interpret the poem correctly (DBE 2011a, p. 14). While this skill, as with any, is developed with practice, the learners' words below indicate that poems were often interpreted for them while their own interpretations were discouraged:

Interviewer: 'Okay. (Long beat of silence) Nothing else? (Learners shake their heads) Alrighty, um … Have you ever been asked to give your interpretation of the poem as you read or study?'

Participant 01: 'No.' [P03: 'Never'] 'No.'

Participant 01: 'She would give us the poem, we had to read through it and then answer it. Only afterwards, she would tell us what the answers were supposed to be, and she wouldn't, like, pause and let us reflect on some of our answers. She would just rush through every poem, and it didn't give you a lot of time to connect your thoughts or like make corrections, and yeah […].'

Participant 01: 'Other than that, it was just you're given the poem, you read the poem, answer the questions.'

Participant 04: 'Yeah, it was more just, 'Here's the poem, here's what it's meant to be'.'

Participant 03: 'For me, there was no interaction or interpretation. We would just get the poems and that's what you needed to study and those are the questions and that's it.'

These direct quotes support Pushpa and Seyed (2014), who explain:

[…] teaching poetry is for using it as a means to prepare the [ learners ] for some final exams […] where [ learners ]  just  listen  to  the teachers; memorize certain words or grammatical points to get high grades instead of teaching [ learners ] independent thoughts and rational expressions. (p. 2014)

Thus, there can be no doubt why learners experience the study of poetry as  irrelevant  to  their  lives,  why  they  struggle  with  the  interpretation  of poems, why higher-order cognitive engagement is not expected or taught and  why  activities  are  perceived  as  challenging.  This  is  unfortunate,  as Pushpa  and  Seyed  (2014)  indicate  that  learning  poetry  can  increase learners' motivation because of its emotional content and increase learners' communication skills through discussions about the poem's content. Thus, using DBP to teach poetry can increase learners' MtL, and thus SDL skills, as  it  uses  a  multitude  of  different  activities  that  encourage  learners' interpretation and exploration of poetry, such as sculpting, for example.

The true impact of DBP on learners' MtL and SDL skills is reflected in the analysis  of  the  focus-group  interviews  post-exposure  to  drama-based activities.

## Focus-group interviews: Post-exposure to drama-based activities

Figure 9.3 illustrates the learners' experiences after their engagement with the drama-based activities.

Figure 9.3 illustrates the many  positive experiences the learners experienced while engaging in drama-based activities, namely: (1) 'easier to interpret the poem', (2) 'sharing of ideas', (3) 'enjoyable learning experiences', (4)  'increased  enjoyment  for  poetry  learning',  (5)  'accommodative  of different ways of learning', (6) 'made poem's content easier to understand',

(7) 'generated interest in the subject content', (8) 'use of one's body and voice to express oneself', (8) 'engaged in group participation and cooperative learning', (9) 'increased memory recall' and (10) 'an appreciation for creative teaching methods'. Oppositely to the pre-drama-based activity exposure, the  learners  had  more  positive  things  to  say  about  poetry  learning  and teaching than negative things. This indicates the ability of DBP to change the way learners engage with their subject material, which supports Van Heerden and  Veldsman  (eds.  2021)  and  Patall  et  al.  (2015)  who  express  that  the pedagogy can encourage student achievement, persistence and engagement and provide opportunities to comprehend and understand their learning in a way that no other pedagogy can. With specific reference to the development of  SDL  skills,  however,  the  increase  in  their  MtL,  as  discussed  in  the observations and illustrated in Figure 9.3, aided learners in progressing from Grow's (1991) Stage 1 of SDL to Stage 4 of SDL, as expressed in Table 9.2 with a verbatim quote to prove.

Table 9.2 further exemplifies the advantages of making use of DBP in the  language  classroom,  learners'  SDL  skills  and  MtL  increased,  which changes the usual way South African teachers teach and South African learners learn, that is, from a direct-teaching method classroom to a more collaborative,  learner-focused,  creative  classroom.  Furthermore,  learners developed skills mentioned by Knowles (1975) and Jennett (1992) related to a self-directed learner:

- · Sets clear learning goals.
- · Self-monitors their own learning process.
- · Evaluates the outcomes of their own learning.
- · Works autonomously.
- · Self-motivates.
- · Is open to learning.
- · Is curious.
- · Identifies value in learning.
- · Self-controls.
- · Learns by taking the initiative.

Furthermore, the researchers also included a 'reflective aspect' to the learners' drama-based poetry learning, which is a critical step in developing SDL skills (Kemp et al. 2022), by asking them to reflect on their own and each other's presentations of the poems. They were asked and asked each other questions such as, 'Who are you?' and 'What are you doing?' Many learners stated that this  was  a  helpful  part  of  engaging  in  the  drama-based  activities  and encouraged them to engage critically, cooperate and reflect, which Kemp et al. (2022) explain are significant features of developing SDL skills:

'I think it helped us understand, like, more at the end kind of finalise everything we just did. It tied it together to make sure everyone understood because if

every group is doing something different, you might not understand what the other groups are doing. So, reflecting at the end really helps.' (Participant 02, female, post-interview 3)

'I think it's good to reflect because it gives open to new ways of interpretation. And with  those  new,  like,  ways  of  interpretation,  you  could  come  up  with  a method on how to understand something better to the extent that everyone in the group understands it better.' (Participant 04, male, post-interview 3)

'It just showed how everyone has a different idea and interprets it differently. So, when you ask, we're able to get from their point of view how they saw that part of the poem.' (Participant 04, male, post-interview 3)

Thus, using the DBP informed by the SCT, among others, is conducive to developing learners' MtL and their SDL skills. This is further supported by the quantitative data reflected in the next section.

## The impact of drama-based pedagogy on learners' self-directed learning skills through the analysis of learners' pre- and post- self-rating scale of self-directed learning questionnaires following their engagement with drama-based activities

The quantitative data aimed to measure the impact of DBP on learners' SDL  skills  specifically,  by  making  use  of  Williamson's  (2007)  SRSSDL questionnaire as a pre- and post-test. Thus, the learners took the test twice: once  before  and  once  after  engaging  in  drama-based  activities.  The questionnaire consisted of 60 questions that learners would answer on a scale of 1-5 (the score 5 represented 'always', while the score 1 represented 'never'). Once all the scores are added, a maximum score of 300 and a minimum score of 60 would determine the learners' level of SDL. This range in score is split into three categories: Low, average and high. The low range is between 60 and 140, which indicates that learners need facilitation and guidance; the average range is between 141 and 220, which indicates that there are areas where learners need improvement for their SDL and the high range is between 221 and 300, which classifies the learners as having effective SDL (Williamson 2007).

When  the  learners  took  the  questionnaire  before  they  engaged with drama-based activities, the data reflected that 11 (55%) out of the 20  participants reported  that they regarded  themselves  as  being moderately  self-directed,  while  nine  (45%)  were  classified  as  having effective SDL. However, after engaging in the drama-based activities, the scores 'switched places': Nine participants were moderately self-directed, while eleven were effectively self-directed. This movement, while minimal, is statistically significant as the Pearson Chi-square value was 0.064. The Cramér's V -value ( φ c), determined by the Pearson Chi-square ( x 2 ) value, was  0.4,  which  indicates  that  DBP  had  a  medium  practical  effect  on learners' SDL levels. Furthermore, the p -value was determined to be 0.017, indicating a statistically significant change between the pre- and postSRSSDL, as p &lt; 0.05 is statistically significant. The use of the questionnaire and  its  values  can  also  be  validated,  as  Cronbach's  alpha  ( α ) was determined for each subsection of Williamsons' (2007) SRSSDL, which is included in Table 9.3.

These values illustrated that the questionnaire was reliable and trustworthy in reflecting the data of this study. Furthermore, dependant  -tests of the t pre-  and  post-SRSSDL  data  indicated  statistically  significant  changes before and after the learners engaged in drama-based activities. Table 9.4 illustrates the value difference between the pre- and post-SRSSDL.

The 'total' value indicated is a value of 0.59. In terms of the change in the pre-SRSSDL and post-SRSSDL tests, a value of 0.2 indicates a minimal change, 0.5 indicates moderate change and 0.8 a large change. Therefore, 0.59  indicates  a  moderate  change  and  a  medium  (thus  practically significant)  effect,  tending  to  the  large  effect  that  the  learners  perceive DBP to have on the increase or development of their SDL skills. This can especially be seen in the difference in the mean values (or Cohen's d value) between  the  pre-and  post-questionnaires  in  the  'Evaluation'  and  'Total' sub-sections  of  Williamson's  (2007)  SRSSDL.  All  values  considered,  the data reflect that incorporating DBP into the language classroom positively impacted learners' SDL skills.

## Reflection on play-based learning for student engagement and the promotion of self-directed learning skills

The data generation indicates that incorporating DBP into the EHL classroom positively affects learners' MtL and SDL skills. This was illustrated through

the observations, focus-group interviews and SRSSDL questionnaires. Thus, making use of the DBP informed by other theories such as Vygotsky's (1978) SCT, the RRT - which acknowledges the reader as part of the process when making meaning from a text (Mart 2019) - and the strategies included in the CAPS curriculum (the text-based approach, the communicative approach and the process approach) may change the way content is delivered and connected within the South African classroom. Not only will the development of MtL and SDL skills aid learners in traversing the world after secondary education, but it may inspire a true enjoyment for learning and, in this case, an appreciation for the art of literature. However, considering this pedagogy was only applied to the teaching and learning of poetry, the researchers cannot assume that this positive impact reflects across all the EHL content. Consequently, the limitations of the study are discussed hereafter.

## Limitations

The researchers identified three limitations of the study: (1) the size of the population, (2) the discipline the study was applied to and (3) the willingness of the teacher to relinquish 'control' over their student during teaching and learning, and  the  wiliness of their students  to express  themselves dramatically following the teacher's facilitation and direction.

Firstly, the population size ( n = 20) makes it impossible to generalise the data and represent all Grade 12 EHL learners, for example. The sample size is  attributed  to  two  things:  Purposive  sample  (as  the  participants  were selected for a specific purpose) and convenience (as one of the researchers works at the small school at which the study was conducted). Additionally, the learners come from generally middle- to upper-class households. As such,  the  data  might  have  been  easier  to  generalise  if  the  study  was conducted  at  a  public  school  with  learners  of  varying  socio-economic backgrounds and at a school with more than one and larger-sized EHL classrooms.

Secondly, the study was only applied to the EHL discipline and, more specifically,  the  study  of  poetry.  Thus,  the  data  cannot  represent  the application of DBP to all EHL content or other English subjects such as English as a First Additional Language (EFAL) and cannot generalise the application of DBP to other subject disciplines such as history or biology. Thus, the study only represents the impact of DBP on Grade 12 EHL learners' SDL skills and MtL in the study of poetry.

Finally, to validly repeat the study and reap the benefits of DBP in the language classroom, the teacher has to be willing to do extensive research on DBP and its application in the language classroom while taking on a facilitative role. This might be difficult for teachers who predominantly use

direct-teaching methods in their language classrooms. Furthermore, this pedagogy also requires learners to express themselves dramatically, which might be difficult for introverted learners and cause anxiety in expressing themselves in front of their peers. Therefore, while there is a 'fun factor' to using  DBP,  teachers  must  maintain  focus  during  drama-based  activities and be able to guide learners  without  explicitly  instructing  them  about their dramatic actions and decisions. Consequently, learners must be willing to express themselves extrovertedly and share their ideas with their group members, should the drama-based activity require them to do so.

## Conclusion

In language classrooms today, learners should not only passively receive knowledge  and  regurgitate  this  knowledge  in  high-stakes  tests  and examinations. Instead, teachers should move away from teacher-centred strategies and challenge learners with play-based learning to enhance their MtL and SDL skills.

This chapter explored the impact of DBP on Grade 12 EHL learners' SDL skills and MtL in a mixed-methods research design. From the qualitative and quantitative empirical investigations, it is clear that the implementation of DBP positively impacted poetry education in the Grade 12 EHL classroom at a private school in South Africa.

Although it was a small sample, and the findings cannot be generalisable, valuable insights could be transferred to other contexts and subjects to empower and equip students with MtL and SDL skills to cope with and become active participants in the global society in the 21st century.

## Abstract

Technological advancement requires relevant teaching-learning methods and  transformation  of  traditional  teaching  approaches  to  promote  skill development for the 21st century and the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) era.  It  is  therefore  essential  for  higher  education  institutions  (HEIs)  to prepare  students  for  innovation  and  future  challenges  that  may  arise.

In  particular,  educational  robotics  (ER)  has  generated  great  interest  in diverse fields such as science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). Educational robotics is also recognised as essential for developing digital skills, critical thinking and collaborative problem-solving, initiative, autonomy  and  computational  thinking.  Therefore,  students  must  take ownership  of  their  learning  when  they  are  introduced  to  ER  and  work together  responsibly.  However,  it  is  unclear  how  ER  can  promote  such abilities  in  a  playful  problem-based  learning  environment  (PPBL).  This chapter aims to provide insight into the study of ER for PPBL using thirdgeneration  cultural-historical  activity  theory  (CHAT)  as  a  research  lens. A qualitative methodology was employed, and two cohorts were involved, namely  the  postgraduate  certificate  in  education  (PGCE)  information technology (IT) students and fourth-year Bachelor of Education (BEd) IT students.  Participants'  narrative  reflections  and  video  recordings  were collected  and  analysed.  The  study's  outcome  provided  valuable  insight regarding  students'  experiences  and  the  need  for  self-directed  learning (SDL) skills in a PPBL context.

## Introduction

New developments, such as 3D-printing, nanotechnology, cloud computing and robotics, associated with the 4IR will significantly impact the world of work and society (Schwab 2016). In addition, the World Economic Forum (WEF) (2020, p. 36) highlights the top fifteen skills for the future, such as 'analytical thinking, innovation, active learning, complex problem-solving, critical  thinking  and  analysis,  and  technology design and programming'. Technological innovation plays a major role in STEM fields and positively affects  students'  skills  and  abilities.  In  particular,  ER  has  generated significant interest in STEM subjects, promotes student engagement and affects their personal development  positively (Arís &amp; Orcos  2019). Educational robotics is also recognised as essential for the development of collaboration,  initiative,  autonomy,  creativity,  systems  management  and computational  thinking  (CT)  (Chang  &amp;  Chen  2020;  González  &amp;  MuñozRepiso 2018; Schina, Esteve-González &amp; Usart 2021). Several skills can be developed by applying ER in a playful learning environment. Playful learning environments, such as game-based  learning (GBL), emphasise the importance  of  students'  engagement  in  problem  formulation  and  the design of games as they require high-level thinking and problem-solving skills in a creative way (Bressler &amp; Annetta 2022).

However,  it  is  unclear  how  ER  can  be  contextualised  to  promote responsible learning in a formal, playful, and problem-based learning (PBL) environment. Consequently, this chapter aims to contextualise ER for PPBL by  using  CHAT  as  a  research  lens  concerning  education  students  who

applied ER in an IT course. The purpose of this chapter was twofold. Firstly, to determine how CHAT can be used as a research lens to study ER for PPBL. Secondly, to explore how ER can promote essential skill development of IT education students in a PPBL context.

Educational robotics is considered crucial for the future and focuses on students'  active  involvement  in  the  planning  and  constructing  of  robot artefacts (Evripidou et al. 2020; López-Belmonte et al. 2021). It was first introduced by Seymour Papert, who envisioned a learning context 'which allowed interaction between learners and computers' (Papert 1980, p. 60) and enabled them to develop innovative thinking. Educational robotics is viewed  as  an  advancement  of  Seymour  Papert's  LOGO,  an  educational environment and programming language with Piaget's constructivist view in mind (Papert 1980). It was initially developed for children and is based on the execution of a so-called 'turtle' according to specific programming commands. Furthermore, ER is based on the constructionist theory, which emphasises  an  active  learning  environment  and  collaborative  learning (Evripidou et al. 2020). According to Ackermann (2001, p. 1), Piaget viewed constructivism  as  a  theory  that  outlines  children's  thinking,  knowledgecreation  and  activities  over  time.  In  contrast,  Papert's  constructionism focused  on  the  learning  and making  of  artefacts , and  'how  these conversations boost self-directed learning […] and facilitate the construction of new knowledge'.

Educational robotics is a multi-faceted approach that comprises the design, assembly and application of robots based on the principles of STEM  (Kim  et  al.  2015).  The  aim  of  ER  is  to  improve  the  learning experience through relevant technologies and pedagogies, as robotics offers  learners  opportunities  to  be  actively  involved  in  the  learning process (Angel-Fernandez &amp; Vincze 2018). Pedagogical approaches for ER focus on student-centred strategies such as problem- and projectbased, inquiry-based, discovery and GBL (Jaipal-Jamani &amp; Angeli 2017; Kim et al. 2015).

The advent of ER in education provides for the development of CT skills (see ch. 5) and helps students to excel in their subject areas (Chiazzese et al. 2018). Wing (2006, p. 2) considers CT as 'a fundamental skill' relating to how humans think and how they approach and solve problems, as based on the concepts of computer science. Students are required to practice CT abilities,  such  as  problem  abstraction,  decomposition,  algorithm  design and pattern recognition (Wing 2006). Several scholars concur that ER is a

suitable tool for developing students' CT skills (Chalmers 2018; Chiazzese et al. 2018). Additionally, the development of CT is one of the reasons for using ER in classrooms (Chiazzese et al. 2018).

Robotics  has  become  increasingly  popular  in  the  educational  field because  it  promotes  the  development  of  skills  such  as  creativity,  group collaboration, problem-solving and critical thinking that are necessary for demands of work in the future (Valsamidis et al. 2021). Therefore, involvement in robotics activities promotes students' high-order thinking and provides for the acquisition of new knowledge and skills as a result of programming robots (Di Battista et al. 2020; Valsamidis et al. 2021).

Unfortunately, teachers' lack of readiness to implement STEM educational programmes,  their  lack  of  knowledge  about  robotic  technology  and reluctance to use new digital technologies in the classrooms are challenges that  hinder  the  effective  implementation  of  ER  (Anisimova,  Sabirova  &amp; Shatunova 2020; Badia &amp; Iglesias 2019; Chalmers 2018). Researchers claim that ER is essential for the professional development of in-service and preservice teachers (González &amp; Muñoz-Repiso 2018; Jaipal-Jamani &amp; Angeli 2017). Therefore, HEIs must develop relevant opportunities and strategies to ensure that future teachers are well-equipped to incorporate robotics into  their  classrooms.  Learning ER is vital in teaching practice, as it will assist  students  in  acquiring  digital  and  supportive  skills  for  their  future (Hadad et al. 2021). Moreover, the successful integration of ER requires that teachers  and  lecturers  apply  several  approaches  for  implementing  ER activities in the classroom; hence, the need for the study reported on here.

## Educational robotics and playful problem-based learning

The  integration  of ER  in playful learning approaches  brings  about transformation in teaching and learning. In this regard, Paaskesen (2020) aimed to provide a playful learning environment in traditional classrooms by  inspiring  teachers  to  implement  such  activities  in  several  subjects. Elements of playful learning reveal the principles of social-constructivist learning  theory  (Piaget  1972;  Vygotsky  1978),  which  deals  with  active learning where knowledge is socially created.

Scholars  concur  that  ER  tends  to  promote  learning  playfully  and demonstrate  students'  involvement  and  collaboration  in  the  learning process (Kalogiannidou, Natsiou &amp; Tsitouridou 2021). Playful learning is an approach  that  assists  students  in  exploring  and  engaging  with  their surroundings and interacting with their peers in formal educational contexts (Zosh et al. 2018). Furthermore, studies have shown that playful learning pedagogies  produce  better  learning  outcomes  than  more  traditional

teaching practices (Nørgård, Toft-Nielsen &amp; Whitton 2017). In particular, playful learning enables students the opportunity to experiment, explore and  express  themselves  (Edwards  2017).  Therefore,  a  playful  mode  of instruction allows for meaningful and joyful learning, active engagement and interactive collaboration with peers to solve a problem or address a challenge (Zosh et al. 2018).

Scholars  also claim that playful learning can  create  a favourable environment for students in higher education (HE) by developing essential abilities they may need in the future (Forbes 2021). Playful learning utilises several pedagogical strategies, such as PBL, to enable students to develop skills by exploring a real-world problem. Thorsted, Bing and Kristensen (2015, p. 63) consider play as a 'mediator for knowledge-creation in problem-based learning' in HE. Playful learning in a PBL environment is student-centred as it fosters students' natural curiosity when addressing an open-ended problem and exposes them to essential subjects that will shape their lives and future careers  (Forbes  2021;  Higueras-Rodríguez,  Medina-García  &amp;  Molina-Ruiz 2020). Similarly, playful approaches enhance student engagement, motivation and quality of learning experiences (Forbes 2021).

## Professional development and self-directed learning

The adoption of robotics in teaching practice has increasingly gained popularity in educational fields, where it aims to promote the development  of  skills  required  by  students  (Valsamidis  et  al.  2021). Scholars claim that ER teacher-training is essential for the professional development of pre-service and in-service teachers (González &amp; MuñozRepiso 2018; Jaipal-Jamani &amp; Angeli 2017; Kim et al. 2015). Moreover, robotics  training  is  becoming  common  in  teacher-training  institutions across  the  globe  (Kim  et  al.  2015;  Majherová  &amp;  Králík  2017).  Teachertraining  institutions  should  therefore  provide  future  teachers  with opportunities  to  be  well-equipped  to  incorporate  robotics  into  their classrooms.  The  successful  integration  of  ER  requires  that  educators understand its benefits and consider the best pedagogical approaches for implementing ER in the classroom. Self-directed learning (SDL) is a vital skill that should be gained by pre-service teachers in order to move society forward in the era of science. Penprase (2018) argues:

More than anything, the 4IR puts a premium on adaptability and in self-directed learning and thinking […] requiring future workers to continuously update their skills and teach themselves about new technologies and new industries. (p. 220)

Educational robotics provides opportunities to develop SDL abilities. Selfdirected  learners  can  manage  their  own  learning  responsibly  and  apply

appropriate  learning  strategies  to  achieve  learning  outcomes  (Knowles 1975). Moreover, SDL is used to strengthen the self-monitoring and selfevaluation skills that are crucial for the growth of professional competence (Wong, Tang &amp; Cheng 2021).

Openness to learning possibilities, self-concept, initiative and independent learning, responsibility for learning, love of learning, creativity and a hopeful outlook  on  the  future  are  itemised  as  SDL's  characteristics  (Guglielmino 2013). Self-directed students inquire and seek new knowledge about which they are inquisitive and eager to take on new challenges and solve intricate problems (Knowles 1975). In a similar vein, higher-order thinking of students can be improved through ER (Bressler &amp; Annetta 2022). Educational robotics was  designed  to  improve  teachers'  confidence  in  teaching  and  learning programming languages (Jaipal-Jamani &amp; Angeli 2017). Effective teacher preparation is  a  vital  factor  in  promoting  the  self-confidence  of  teachers involved in teaching ER (Scaradozzi et al. 2019). In addition, the move to ER is  essential  as  the  South  African  Department  of  Basic  Education's  (DBE) 2021 draft of the Curriculum and Assessment Policy Statement (CAPS) for Coding and Robotics Grades R-9 has been compiled and planned to be formally implemented in schools in the next few years. As a result, teachertraining programmes should expose pre-service teachers to ER to support and  prepare  them  to  gain  content  and  pedagogical  knowledge  and  to provide professional development opportunities.

## Cultural-historical activity theory

The CHAT originated from social constructivism and is mostly influenced by the work of Lev Vygotsky, a Russian psychologist, who emphasised the role  of  psychology  in  teaching  and  learning  (Vygotsky  1978).  Vygotsky believed  that  culture  is  an  important  aspect  of  children's  cognitive development. Moreover, he referred to the core concept of the zone of proximal development (ZPD) regarding a learner's abilities and the potential development of a learner with the guidance of a teacher, adult or supportive peers (Vygotsky 1978).

Leontiev refined the activity theory (Leontiev 1978), while Engeström focused on active and ongoing interactions within socio-cultural settings (Engeström 2001). The activity system depicted in Figure 10.1 comprises six interconnected elements that work together to achieve the goal of the activity  (Engeström  2001).  Each  of  the  elements  (subject,  object,  tools, rules, community and division of labour) is outlined:

- 1. Subject: People involved in activities and who perform certain actions to achieve particular objectives.
- 2. Object: The activities being acted on to achieve a specific goal or outcome.

<!-- image -->

Source : Adapted from Engeström (1987, 2001).

- 3. Tools: The medium through which subjects perform an activity.
- 4. Community: Several people who work together and share the object of activity.
- 5. Rule: Formal and informal conventions and norms involved in an activity system.
- 6. Outcome: The goal that the subject aims to achieve.
- 7. Division of labour: Ways by which the subject manages to achieve the outcome.

## Third-generation cultural-historical activity theory

The third-generation CHAT connects two activity systems working towards individual and collective goals (Engeström 2001). Cultural-historical activity theory views human activity as a complicated process involving a subject driven to achieve a goal and assisted by tools, which can be either physical or mental opportunities (Engeström 2009). An activity system is viewed as the  unit  of  analysis  in  CHAT  while  simultaneously  acknowledging  the influence of other activity systems on the original activity system. Engeström (2001) highlights five guiding principles that reflect the essence of CHAT, namely:

- · The  first  principle  emphasises  that  an  activity  system  is  communal, artefact-facilitated and object-focused.
- · The second principle highlights various voices or dialogues with people who are involved in the activity system (e.g. subject, object and community).
- · The third principle accentuates the feature of historicity as it requires a long time to form and transform activity systems.

- · The fourth  principle  focuses  on  the  role  of  so-called  'contradictions', which are essential drivers of growth and change.
- · The  fifth  principle  affirms  the  potential  for  significant  change  in  an activity system.

The activity is an essential construct in CHAT in terms of its purpose and  role  in  the  interaction  ('activities  directed  towards  the  object  to achieve a goal') between actors or so-called 'subjects' (Engeström 1999, p. 9) with the aim to achieve a particular goal (metaphoric presentation of objects). The third-generation CHAT can be used as a research lens to  assist  in  comparing  and  interpreting  findings  in  activity  systems (Mentz  &amp;  De  Beer  2019,  p.  56).  Figure  10.2  shows  the  application  of CHAT  on  an  interpersonal  plane  (teacher  and  learner)  where  the enhancement of SDL is the outcome of the activity system (De Beer &amp; Mentz 2017, p. 11).

Although the activity system in Figure 10.2 focuses on enhancing SDL, it could be refined to provide an elaborate understanding of PPBL and ER. Carvalho  et  al.  (2015,  p.  2)  applied  the  CHAT  framework  in  the  case  of postgraduate  students  involved  in  designing  severe  games  driven  by  a socio-cultural context. Based on the activity theory, the students considered educational games as 'part of a complex system that also includes human actors […] and the motives driving their [students'] interactions with the game' (Carvalho et al. 2015, p. 2).

In  Figure 10.3, we illustrate how we applied CHAT as a conceptual lens  to  indicate  border-crossing  and  object-driven  activities  and  the deliberate  interaction  between  the  lecturer  (facilitator)  (Subject  [in activity  system  one  on  the  left])  and  students  (Subject  [in  activity

system  two  on  the  right])  where  PPBL  was  applied  with  the  aim  of analysing students' mastering of coding and robotics as well essential skill development.

All  outcomes  of  both  activity  systems  are  explicitly  indicated  with  a verb  as  they  involve  'a  common  word  to  describe  an  action,  state,  or occurrence' (The Concise Oxford English Dictionary 2004, p. 1605). Using verbs,  therefore,  serves  a  specific  purpose  in  terms  of  emphasising  the interrelated activities of both subjects and providing for operational action to  achieve  the  outcomes.  Such  activities  are  also  a  function  of  time,  as students are exposed to ER and develop essential skills over time. However, several  internal  contradictions  may  occur  as  the  lecturer  offered  an opportunity  for  essential  skill  development  while  students  were  not introduced to ER previously. This is elaborated upon and discussed based on the study's emergent findings.

## Playful problem-based learning intervention using educational robotics

Details regarding the intervention are outlined in this section.

## Participants

Two  cohorts  were  involved  in  this  qualitative  study,  namely  PGCE  IT students as well as fourth-year BEd IT students (Table 10.1). For practical reasons, the students worked together in small groups to allow members to collaborate and contribute to the group. Members decided with whom they wanted to work. Each member had to be committed and willing to take responsibility for tasks involved in the robotics problem. The Research Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Education (EduREC) and the institutional gatekeeper approved the research project. Furthermore, all students who participated completed and signed informed consent to be involved in the research. Although two cohorts were involved, it should be stated that we

did not aim to compare these cohorts but rather to implement PPBL with the  use  of  ER.  Moreover,  only  a  few  students  enrol  annually  for  PGCE (full-time) or BEd in IT. As a result, we would like to allow all students to develop skills in ER, as it is essential for future demands.

In terms of trustworthiness, the data analysis was conducted in such a way as to allow for precise and consistent interpretation of meanings as they  emerged  from  participant's  written  feedback.  In  addition,  video recordings of students' programming attempts as well as robot performance, based on the programming, were used as a means of triangulating findings and to indicate certain patterns of meaning.

## Contextualised robot activities

Participants mentioned that they did not have prior knowledge of robotics. Consequently, it required detailed planning on the part of the lecturers to plan  class  activities  and  guide  the  students  in  their  learning.  Playful problem-based  learning  was  applied  as  an  active  teaching-learning strategy  in  this  research.  The  rationale  was  to  focus  on  the  activities involved in the process  of playing and, therefore, to provide  rich opportunities for learning as these emerged in collaborative and playful problem-solving  (see  ch.  4).  Students  worked  together  in  groups  while the lecturer planned robot activities on a learning curve to facilitate them. A brief introduction to LEGO® MINDSTORMS® EV3 (Figure 10.4) was given. The MINDSTORMS® core kit consists of a programmable brick, large and medium motors, as well as several sensors and supporting cables. Students were expected to build, program and execute robot movements, engage in critical discussion and reflect on their programming. Participants used the visual EV3 programming tool and transferred the code (program) to the robot using a USB port. Robot movements (based on the coding) were performed on a 12 cm × 12 cm vinyl mat.

Teaching-learning activities, shown in Figure 10.5, were conducted over a period of four weeks.

Initially,  students  were  provided  with  study  materials  to  give  some background on what programming in LEGO® MINDSTORMS® entails. This was  followed  by  several  activities  where  students  collaborated  in  small groups.  They  were  requested  to  build  a  simple  robot  (Riley  Rover)  to perform basic movements (e.g. rotation and iteration). The following week, group members combined robot movement using various sensors. After each activity, students assessed each other according to their contribution to the group.

FIGURE 10.5: Teaching and learning activities involved in coding and robotics.

As part of professional development, group members were challenged to formulate a class activity, which had to include building their own robot, movement and use of sensors as previously done in class. Instructions for this activity were the following:

- · Design, build and move a robot to achieve certain objectives.
- · Use several sensors, implement gears and also provide for push or pull actions.

- · For each activity:
- ◦ include photos (start and end position)
- ◦ opy  the  visual  programme  code  from  LEGO®  MINDSTORMS®  to  a c Microsoft (MS) Word document
- ◦ eflect on each robot movement r
- ◦ make a two-three-minute video of the movement as evidence with each activity.

After  completing  the  assignments,  students  reflected  individually  and assessed themselves as well as their peers in terms of their responsibilities (individual and group), assistance, interaction and contribution to group work. In total, fifteen students participated in the reflections. They were prompted with questions to direct their thinking, as shown in Box 10.1.

Furthermore, students gave feedback on their challenges and how the group  dealt  with  them.  After  four  weeks,  students  submitted  coding diagrams, videos and reflections on their group work and PPBL experiences on the LMS. Students' assignments and reflections were manually analysed using open coding (Saldaña 2016), and certain themes emerged.

## Findings

Four  themes  emerged  from  the  data.  Selected  exemplars  related  to  a specific theme are included.

## Authentic playful problem-based experiences

The students were challenged with open-ended robotics problems. Some responses  were  the  following:  '[We  had  to]  work  out  an  activity  for learners to apply PBL and get to know the environment of [MINDSTORMS®]'

(Respondent 04, student, date unknown); '[ w ]e […] set good goals for ourselves […] we struggle with programming, so it makes us work slower than we wanted […] but we get it right' (Respondent 05, student, date unknown). Students also consulted various sources to assist them in using sensors: '[ W ]e searched for a lot of information about colour sensors […] especially  on  YouTube'  (Respondent  05,  student,  date  unknown);  '[ ] I praised and valued everyone's effort. At first, we all built the car, but later we switched roles' (Respondent 14, student, date unknown). The value of addressing authentic problems was evident in students' feedback. They also  valued  group  work  and  communication,  as  indicated  in  the  next theme.

## Active student collaboration and communication

Noteworthy  is  students'  feedback  about  their  active  collaboration  with PPBL.  Some  examples  are:  '[ A ]ll members  worked  well  together  and communicated about the problem and solutions' (Respondent 07, student, date unknown); '[ w ]e work very hard, and we have seen ourselves more determined,  and  it  made  us  work  very  close  together'  (Respondent  01, student,  date  unknown).  Students  were  motivated  and  realised  that everyone  had  to  contribute  to  the  group  in  order  to  succeed.  Group members emphasised the importance of enhancing each other's learning:  '[ e ]veryone was helpful and did their part […] helped with the code' (Respondent 07, student, date unknown); 'when someone doesn't understand,  the  rest  will  explain  to  everyone'  (Respondent  08,  student, date unknown); '[ t ]eamwork is what made  the robot a success' (Respondent 14, student, date unknown).

'We didn't have anyone that just sat around and did nothing. Everyone made sure to help in the building process and in the coding process thus ensuring that everyone is responsible for the work that we did.' (Respondent 12, student, date unknown)

Positive  and  negative  responses  regarding  group  communication  were noted: '[ W/hairspace ]e are communicating well and sharing ideas' (Respondent 01, student, date unknown); '[ c ]ommunication is important to argue and in the end to deliver a better product' (Respondent 04, student, date unknown); '[ w ]e all played a similar role, however [Student T] was the programmer, and we all gave some ideas on which events should be taken'; '[ ] was able I to follow instructions on how to build the robot. I was able to understand different opinions when it came to discussing the program' (Respondent 13, student, date unknown). Unfortunately, some groups had some challenges: '[ W/hairspace ]e struggled with communication, everyone just wanted to do [what they wanted] and not notice what the others were doing' (Respondent 03, student, date unknown).

## Students' reflections on robot activities

Students reflected on their thinking and adjusted their programming to ensure the robot movements were performed correctly. Some responses were the following:

'[ W ]e improved on the previous problem each time and then made adjustments to address the problems that arose' (Respondent 04, student, date unknown); '[ w ]e constantly adjusted the number of degrees until it was done correctly' (Respondent 06, student, date unknown); '[ o ]ur  planning  went  well,  and  the robot did what we wanted it to do' (Respondent 05, student, date unknown); '[ t ]he colour sensor only worked on certain colours.' (Respondent 03, student, date unknown)

In addition, most groups experienced challenges with time management: '[ O ]ur pace was a bit slow because we had to restart our programme […] we were a bit disappointed and made us want to work harder the next time' (Respondent 01, student, date unknown); '[ ]he class time was a bit t short, or we did not spend our time properly' (Respondent 08, student, date unknown); '[ w ]e  worked efficiently and were able to complete the goal' (Respondent 04, student, date unknown); '[ ]t is really nice that we i work  together  […]  LEGO®  [MINDSTORMS®]  [are]  fun'  (Respondent  10, student, date unknown). In contrast, one student (Respondent 06, student, date unknown) mentioned that, although she participated, she considered robotics a waste of time, as she was very busy and could have been doing better things (Respondent 06, student, date unknown).

## Essential skill development for the future

Digital  technologies  require  lecturers  to  assist  students  in  developing essential skills for the 21st century and the 4IR. The incorporation of ER was valuable for students: '[ W/hairspace ]e had to think, and we brainstormed and came up  with  solutions'  (Respondent  01,  student,  date  unknown).  Students initially experienced problems working with the various types of sensors. The coding, in particular, was a problem: '[ S ]truggled to make the colour sensor  work,  but  everyone  was  thinking  of  solutions  to  get  it  right' (Respondent  03,  student,  date  unknown);  '[ p ]roximity  sensor  was  a  bit lacking; it wasn't exact with the percentages. Colour sensor wasn't accurate with the colours' (Respondent 14, student, date unknown). Group members also referred to important skills they developed: '[ W/hairspace ]e had good reasoning ability and could use it to deal with error handling' (Respondent 04, student, date unknown); '[ w ]e had to research how to perform a rotation before we could implement it' (Respondent 04, student, date unknown); '[ c ]ontinue to improve it over and over, did it step by step' (Respondent 07, student, date unknown); '[ ]here were pieces that were missing when we wanted to t do the push/pull activity, we had to improvise […] we didn't have an object

to test the push/pull activity so we used wheels and some pieces the robot can perform its task on' (Respondent 14, student, date unknown). Reflection regarding their progress involved the following: '[ g ]ood progress and the longer  we  worked,  the  faster  we  got  it.  Good  progression  was  shown' (Respondent 05, student, date unknown); '[ ]t was nice to physically build i the robot and to see how it fits together […] we strengthened the robot [structure] and were able to test additional code and programs' (Respondent 08, student, date unknown). Development of skills was also indicated by Respondent 12:

'In  the  whole process of building the robot I made sure to take notes of the various factors that went into building the robot such as the design, the use of the different parts and the little errors in the coding process that we would run into. After making an error I would make sure to reflect on the error to find out if  there was anything I could have done better in order to avoid some of the mistakes we made.' (Student, date unknown)

Regarding the development of CT, such as decomposition and algorithmic thinking, Respondent 12 stated:

'[ T ]he robot needed to make use of the colour sensor and the motion sensor. So, we took them apart first and firstly added in functions for the colour sensor and made sure they work before starting with the next section of the motion sensors coding. After both were completed and tested separately, we went to work on adding them together to then complete the task.' (Student, date unknown)

## Discussion

In  the  study  reported  here,  we  investigated  how  ER  can  promote  skill development  and  SDL  in  a  playful  problem-based  context.  Among  the findings were that students set specific learning goals, were curious and searched for relevant information regarding LEGO® robots, they learnt the MINDSTORMS® programming environment, they assisted each other (e.g. how  to  use  several  sensors)  and  ensured  that  everyone  was  actively involved  in  building  and  coding  the  robot.  Participating  students  also persisted in their learning (a characteristic of a self-directed learner), as some groups struggled with the programming but got it right in the end. Group members emphasised that working responsibly together enabled them  to  succeed.  Facilitation  by  the  lecturer  was  crucial  in  scaffolding students. The findings align with Valsamidis et al. (2021), who argued that SDL  promotes  the  development  of  skills  such  as  creativity, group collaboration, problem-solving and critical thinking.

In  terms  of  professional  development,  future  teachers  must  develop relevant abilities and select appropriate strategies to incorporate robotics in their classrooms.  Consequently,  the  students  were  challenged  to formulate their own programming problem, plan a solution, use relevant

components and deal with complexity. This is supported by Scaradozzi et al. (2019), who claimed that effective teacher-training is a vital factor in both the knowledge and the self-confidence of teaching ER.

Although  it  was  initially  difficult,  most  of  them  were  interested  and collaborated  in  this  challenge.  One  group  revealed  that  they  had  some problems  with  communication;  however,  most  of  the  members  were actively  involved,  shared  ideas,  argued  about  possible  solutions  and reflected  on  their  thinking.  One  hurdle  to  overcome  was  students'  time management, as some did not spend their time properly while others were able to achieve their goals. Students set aside time to reflect on their ER activities and learn from their mistakes to improve their thinking about the robot  movement.  Iterative  cycles  of  programming  and  robot  execution were  essential  to  improve  each  group's  performance.  Group  members considered their learning about programming and robotics as valuable for the  future.  They  strengthened  the  robot  structure,  developed  complex thinking (reasoning, logical thinking, judgement, decision-making and CT), dealt with error handling and debugging, learnt from their mistakes and critically  reflected  on  their  thinking.  Bressler  and  Annetta  (2022)  argue that students' higher-order thinking skills (HoTS) can be improved through ER.  The  findings  are  also  supported  by  Di  Battista  et  al.  (2020),  who emphasise that involvement in robotics activities  provides  for  acquiring new knowledge and skills as a result of programming such robots.

In  addition, students developed CT skills, such as decomposition and algorithmic thinking (see ch. 5). Wing (2014) emphasises these skills are important for future development and society. The fun and playful element in PPBL were also prominent. Students were motivated and reflected that they  enjoyed  ER  and  experienced  LEGO®  MINDSTORMS®  to  be  fun,  as mentioned: '[I]t was nice to build the robot physically and to see how it fits together'.

Learning about ER is vital for the digital future, as stated by Hadad et al. (2021). Findings are supported by scholars who emphasise skill development in ER for the future (Schina et al. 2021). Complex problem-solving, active and innovative thinking, design and programming of solutions, and the use of active learning strategies (e.g. PBL and playful learning) are highlighted by several  scholars,  such  as  the  WEF  (2020),  to  be  crucial  for  the  4IR. Consequently, ER mediates the learning for the 4IR as students develop as independent and self-directed learners.

Regarding the application of the third-generation activity theory in this study,  the  findings  indicate  that  students  enjoyed  PPBL  and  several opportunities were provided to develop higher-order thinking, CT and the value of student collaboration to address the problems in ER. For example,

students  had  to  understand  that  the  robot's  components  for  input  and output had to be attached in a specific way. They built and strengthened the  robot  structure,  and  this  was  followed  by  understanding  the  visual programming palette and applying programming code in a logical way to perform  the  robot  movement.  As  part  of  this  activity  system,  students (Subject 2 ) demonstrated knowledge construction and the development of crucial skills and could take ownership of their learning. However, it is worth noting that one student mentioned that she considered robotics a waste of time,  as  she  could  have  used  it  much  better  than  doing  two  hours  of robotics  a  week.  In  addition,  some  groups  experienced  difficulty  in completing  a  weekly  assignment  on  time.  Furthermore,  this  indicates certain tensions in the activity system where the students experienced ER as coercive instead of an opportunity to develop skills for the future. It also emphasised enhanced scaffolding and guidance from the lecturer (Subject 1 ) regarding group work and time management.

## Reflective points, recommendations and limitations

Based on our findings, we highlight some important points and suggest some recommendations:

- · Playful problem-based learning provides nuanced ways of learning and creative and innovative thinking and favours fun activities.
- · Detailed planning and design of activities and scaffolding are essential to encourage students when solving complex problems and developing active learning abilities.
- · Interpersonal  skills,  effective  collaboration  and  group  communication are crucial in PPBL.
- · Students must be owners of their learning, be motivated and develop as self-directed learners.
- · Educational  robotics  mediates  learning  and  skill  development  for  a challenging future and the 4IR.

The  scope  of  the  research  is  limited  to  IT  students  in  the  North-West University's (NWU) Faculty of Education, South Africa. The study consisted of a small sample size (15), making it difficult to generalise to HEIs. Further research is required to help scholars understand whether similar trends are evident elsewhere.

## Conclusion

This  chapter  highlighted  how  ER  could  promote  skill  development  in  a playful problem-based environment. Third-generation CHAT was used as a

conceptual  framework  to  guide  the  researchers  in  understanding  the border-crossing and object-driven activities between two activity systems where  PPBL  was  applied.  It  was  clear  that  most  students  enjoyed  the application of ER in PPBL, and opportunities were provided for collaboration and the development of HoTS while addressing problems in ER. Students' experiences  with  ER  offered  the  promotion  of  SDL  when  working  with robots. Various reflective points were also mentioned. Unfortunately, only a  small  number  of  participants  were  involved  in  the  research,  and  the findings cannot be generalised.

This edited collection offers a compelling examination of how to use games and play to teach. With an interdisciplinary and international focus, this book critically meets a growing international demand within academia to educate using games. Teaching effectively utilising games is difficult, especially from a global and cross-disciplinary perspective, making this book's diverse pedagogical perspectives essential to scholarship.

The  chapters  in  this  book  cover  different  aspects  of  building  engaging  pedagogies  and  active learning. Aspects include problem-based learning, interactive pedagogy of play, joyful learning, game-based tasks, computational thinking, using puzzles, developing teacher identity and cultural facets. The book also provides theoretical foundations and practical examples of integrating these practices into various subjects and grade levels. One of the most important - and probably most challenging - developments in teaching currently is the production of 21st-century skills such as critical thinking, creativity and problem-solving through self-directed learning.

This book provides scholarly recommendations on strategies for active engagement in teaching and learning. It implements a holistic approach to developing self-directed learning, especially in the mathematics discipline. These recommendations can enhance self-directed learning, not only for  future  challenges  but  for  current  challenges  faced  in  the  educational  environment.  This publication will also spur scholarly research in this new and challenging field.
