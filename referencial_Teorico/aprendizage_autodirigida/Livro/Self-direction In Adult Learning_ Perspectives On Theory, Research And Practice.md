## Series editor's note

The Routledge series of  books on the Theory and  Practice of Adult Education in North America provides practitioners,  scholars and students with a collection  of  studies  by  eminent  scholars  of  all  aspects  of  adult  education throughout  the continent.  The series already includes  books on  planning, history, and learning in the workplace. It is intended that others will be added to the list from all the sub-disciplines of adult  education. They will cover both theoretical  and practical  considerations  and each  will  constitute  a  major contribution to its own specific field of study. Some of these will be symposia while others will consist of single-authored treatises.

This series of  books  has  been well received throughout the adult education world and the current volume is another relevant and significant study. One of the most predominant features of adult education over the past decade has been  the study of self-direction,  but there have been few books that have examined the theory and practice of self-directed learning. Many papers have been published on this subject and prominent among those authors have been Brockett and Hiemstra. Hence  this book  extends the debate and opens the discussion in some new and important ways.

Ralph Brockett is an Associate  Professor at the University of  Tennessee and has played a very active role in the American Association for Adult and Continuing Education in recent years. Roger Hiemstra is Professor of Adult Education at the Syracuse University, he is currently working with a Kellogg sponsored project in which the Syracuse adult education materials are being made more widely available through various technologies. In addition, Roger has been a past chair of the Commission of Professors of Adult Education in the United States and his previous writing is well known to the field.

## Preface

Few topics, if any, have received more attention in the field of adult education over  the past  two decades  than self-directed  learning.  Ever  since the  1971 publication  of Allen Tough's seminal study, The Adult's Learning  Projects, fascination  with self-planned and self-directed learning has led to one of the most  extensive  and  sustained  research  efforts  in  the  history  of  the  field. During the same time, a host of new programs and practices, such as external degree programs and computer and video technologies, have gained enthusiastic support  from  many segments of the field. The time seems  appropriate for  drawing some meaning from  all of these theory, research,  and  practice developments.

Self-Direction  in Adult Learning: Perspectives on Theory, Research, and Practice is our effort to make sense out of this body of knowledge and array of  practices  that  have  done  so  much  to  shape  the  current  face  of  adult education in North America and, indeed, throughout much of the world. The purpose  of  the  book  is  twofold.  First,  we  have  attempted  to  provide  a comprehensive synthesis of major  developments, trends, issues,  and practices relative to self-direction and adult education. Second, we have  offered an  array  of  strategies  that  have  direct  application  to  practice.  The  ideas presented in this book represent over 25 years of combined commitment to better understanding the area of self-direction in adult learning.

In attempting to bridge theory and practice, the book  was written with several audiences in mind. First, it was written for practitioners  from a wide range  of  settings  concerned  with  developing programs  for  adult  learners where  self-direction is  an integral part  of  the  program.  Included  here  are practitioners  involved  in  such  areas  as independent study/external degree programs, training and development activities, agricultural extension,  health and human services, literacy efforts,  and continuing professional  education. We hope that the book  will be of value not only to those who are currently employed in programs where self-direction is stressed,  but also for those who may  be  considering  adopting some  of  these  approaches  within existing

## x Preface

programs.  We also hope that the book will be helpful to those readers with a more general interest in learning about areas of current development  relative to the education of adults.

Another  major audience for which this book  is intended  is made up of those professors,  graduate students, and researchers  in adult education  who have an interest in the area of self-direction in adult learning. We have tried to provide a comprehensive look at the "state of the art" of self-direction  and, thus, believe that the book could be used effectively  either as a primary text for courses on self-direction  in adult learning  or as a supplemental  text for courses on adult learning or current issues in adult education. In addition, it is our hope  that the book has generated many questions that are worthy of further investigation; thus, the book is also intended as a tool for  researchers exploring the territory of self-direction.

The  13 chapters of the book are arranged into five sections, or parts. Part I, "Introduction,"  consists of two chapters. Chapter 1  sets the stage for the book by presenting  scenarios  for three types of learners, in order to illustrate that self-direction  is  a  way  of  life.  We  also  present  and  discuss  a number of popular myths that have helped to create confusion about self-direction  and its potential for adult learners. In the second chapter, we define  self-direction and offer a model designed to help alleviate some of the confusion  surrounding the many ways in which self-directed learning and related  terms  have been  described.  In this model, we  suggest  that  self-direction  can best  be understood as both an instructional method and as a personality  dimension.

Part II, "The Underlying Knowledge  Base,*' consists of three chapters that critically examine the research literature  on self-direction. Here, we look at the  various  ways  in  which self-direction  has  been  studied  and provide  a critical analysis of this research.

The next two chapters, which comprise Part  III, "Process and  personal orientation",  are  intended to  bridge  theory  and  practice.  These chapters present  strategies for  facilitating  self-directed learning  as  an  instructional method and for enhancing learner self-direction as an aspect of adult personality. Thus, each chapter emphasizes one of the dimensions presented  in the model in Chapter 2.

In Part  IV, "Fostering  Opportunities for Self-Direction  in Adult Learning," we present four chapters that address what we believe to be major issues for practice. Chapters in this section focus on self-direction in institutionallybased adult education programs, policy issues, international perspectives on self-direction,  and ethical issues.

Part V, "A Glance at the Future," begins with a hypothetical  scenario of what a family of the near future might look like if they embrace  the ideals of self-direction. And the final chapter includes a number of  recommendations

that  we believe  are  important  in  creating  future  growth  of  self-direction ideals.

Finally, it might help to put this book into perspective by knowing a little more about our own journey over the past several years in trying to better understand the idea of self-direction  in adult learning. We both have carried out and supervised research studies where we have watched with amazement how alive people  become  when they begin to talk about their own learning and how they have been able to take control of these efforts. When they come to realize  that it is "okay" to be the major  planner  of  such  learning, that enthusiasm  generally  jumps  another  notch.  The  enjoyment  and  thrill  of seeing  this self-discovery  has led us to talk  about self-direction  at professional meetings, to conduct workshops on  the  topic, and  to search continuously for new ways to enhance opportunities for self-direction within the university  classes we teach.  This  book  is an attempt to document our "odyssey" in the search for new and creative ways to embrace the ideals of self-direction  in adult learning.  If we have been able to stimulate awareness further, by conveying  our enthusiasm for self-direction and our expectations for future promise,  we are doubly gratified.

We would like to offer  special thanks to Peter Jarvis, Series  Editor for Routledge,  for  believing in  our  project,  and  to  Sue  Joshua,  Editor  for Routledge, for her advice  and assistance.  We are especially gratified for the editorial  support and advice offered  by our colleague Mary Beth Hinton. A special thanks is owed to Wanda Chasteen, who provided valuable assistance in preparing  the  final  manuscript.  We  would  also  like  to thank the  many graduate student colleagues from five different  universities with whom we have worked on research projects, in classes, and during workshops; our own ideas  have been  vastly  refined  over  time as a result of these  interactions. Finally,  we wish to acknowledge  the support  given to us by our  families: Patricia and Megan Brockett; and Janet, Nancy, and David Hiemstra, They have  lived  with  us  through  the  struggles  and  the  joys  of  our  work  in self-direction,  and this book is our way of saying "thanks."

## Parti Introduction

Self-direction has been one of the most exciting topics to emerge relative to adult learning in the past two decades. As a way of introducing  the topic, it is stressed  that self-direction  is not a fad; rather it is a way of life for  most adults. In the opening chapter, three hypothetical cases are  presented in order to  illustrate  this  point.  Also,  the  chapter  includes  a look  at self-direction throughout history and a discussion of several common myths that have often brought confusion to what self-direction means.

Chapter 2 presents a conceptual framework  for better understanding the concept of self-direction. There has been much confusion over what is meant by  self-direction.  In  this chapter,  the Personal  Responsibility  Orientation (PRO) model is presented as a tool for better understanding this  distinction. The PRO model is premised on the idea that individuals taking  personal responsibility  for  their learning is  central to  understanding self-direction. From this, it is possible to recognize that self-direction can be seen as both an instructional  method (self-directed learning) and a personality  characteristic (learner self-direction). Also, the PRO model stresses the importance of understanding the social context  in which  learning takes place. This model serves as a framework  for the remainder of the book.

Mary's  interest in genealogy  grew slowly out of the enjoyment of  hearing her grandparents talk about the "old country" and all the interesting  characters on the family tree. However, high school, college, first job, more  college, and marriage all took considerable energy. Then, soon after moving with her family for a college  teaching position, she read about a course  in  genealogy offered  through the local community college. Wanting some variety in her otherwise heavy schedule of juggling home and work responsibilities,  Mary enrolled  in the 8-week course.

Taking the course revealed to Mary a whole world of ideas, resources, and other people interested in tracing their family backgrounds.  However, it was after the course ended that Mary's real learning about genealogy  began.  She started  reading everything she could get her hands on about how to gather genealogical  information. Her university library had an excellent  genealogy section  with experienced  librarians eager  to  show  people  how  to use  the resources.  Mary also filled  out many forms requesting archival  information and sent them to the Genealogical Society in Salt Lake City for their computer searches.

As her  family  information began  to  accumulate, she had  the  bonus  of communicating  with relatives not  only  in  the  United  States,  but  in  other countries as well. In addition,  Mary had an opportunity to visit with a second cousin  who was gathering genealogical  information on one portion of the family tree. She also began to communicate with people  she did not know, but who happened to share her family name, about possible connections with other families. Each exchange of information led to more clues, She believed, too, that she helped her second cousin gain some new searching  skills.

Over the past  15 years Mary has continued gathering information about the  family  and  about how  to do  genealogical work. She  wrote  a  40-page summary for her relatives, visited two of the countries where ancestors had lived, and even taught a non-credit  genealogy class twice. Her visit to one of the countries was especially educational,  resulting  in some new and valuable

## 4 Introduction

information. She also stimulated  a third newly met cousin to begin genealogy work on the family  name. In short, her independent  genealogical research has become a way of life.

NeaTs approach to life and learning was quite different  from Mary's, and it has changed dramatically in the past 15 years. When he retired at age 62 from an engineering position, Neal didn't really have a hobby, unless one counted the occasional golf game he played with colleagues. He had always  worked very hard, and his wife's sudden death two years before he retired  had only intensified his need to stay very busy with work. However, his son John often voiced  concern  about  Neal's  working too hard, and a growing  disenchantment with his firm's emphasis on weapons  development prompted  Neal  to jump at an offer  for early retirement.

For the first  few weeks Neal enjoyed rising late, working  in the  garden, cleaning out the long-neglected attic, and visiting his grandchildren.  He woke one morning, though, and realized that he wanted something  a little  more challenging out of life.  He visited a senior citizen center twice, but tired of the card playing so popular with many of the men there. Then one  morning he drove to the local  library hoping to find  an interesting book. By accident he stopped  in the magazine room and picked up a recent  issue of a science periodical.  His life suddenly  took a large turn in direction.

The magazine featured several articles on alternative power  development in  the  United  States  and  throughout the  world. As  he  read  about  various experiments, his mind wandered to the ranch house that his son and family occupied. They had a ranch house on a small hill in the country. There were about 10 acres of mostly weeds, scrub trees, and large rocks surrounding  the house; a small trout stream draining  from the nearby hills wound through the property. Musing to himself that some of the experiments might work at that site, he called his son that  afternoon to talk about starting an alternative power project. John agreed enthusiastically, as he had complained  for years  about the high price of electricity that seemed a part of living in the country.

Neal then began reading everything he could find  on alternative  power. With his  engineering  background, he  soon  discovered  the need  for  more technical information than the popular press could provide. He attended two conferences devoted to alternative  power, toured some experimental  homes, and began to correspond  by letter with people in other states  and countries about what they were doing.

The first  project he tackled involved wind as an energy source. He had read about a new type of windmill design developed in The Netherlands that showed  promise.  There  was  a  flat,  open  field  behind  the  house,  so  Neal designed and installed a windmill there similar to The Netherlands'  prototype.  After  Neal  conquered  some  design  and  regulation  problems, the

windmill  began  generating  enough  electricity  at peak  wind  conditions to meet about 20 percent of John's needs.

Neal  then  spent  several  months  clearing  brush  around  a portion of the stream where he installed  a miniature water-driven turbine patterned  after a Colorado  experiment.  The  turbine  generated  enough  electricity  to  pump water  to  the  garden  area,  meeting  another 10 percent  of  John's  power requirements. NeaTs next task was to install a solar panel on John's roof that now meets  most  of  the family's hot  water needs.  Meanwhile,  throughout these activities Neal has continued to read as much as  he can about  alternative power. He has actually become somewhat of an expert and a local celebrity. He has been interviewed  on local television,  taught a course on  alternative energy sources, and is now writing a book about the topic.

Alice's independence  as a learner was slow to develop as compared  with Neal. Alice had been a home economics field-worker for a family planning organization  in  her  native country, Nigeria, for  eight  years.  Her  college education in home economics education  had consisted of a four-year program with grades that placed her in the top one-third of the class. Alice had earned the respect  of her  teachers as a hardworking student who  would make  an excellent professional in the home economics  field.

Alice was quite ambitious, however, and by the end of 10  years she wished to  leave  field  work  and  serve  in  some  administrative capacity  with  the national  headquarters  in  Lagos.  She  applied  for  federal  support  and  was granted  a fellowship for  advanced  education. She then  applied  to  several universities  in  the  United  States  and was  accepted  into  a masters  degree program in adult education in one of them.

Upon arriving at the university she began to experience  several  frustrations.  Finding  an  affordable  place  to  live within walking  distance  of  the campus was confusing and difficult. The International Student Office eventually helped her find  a place, but those first three days were  nerve-racking. Then she met with her graduate advisor  and had a difficult time understanding the program's  philosophy:  students were expected  to take major responsibility in designing their graduate programs by choosing  their own courses, final  advisors,  and even  intensive  examination questions.  Although  Alice understood  the  words  of  her  advisor  and  the  written  materials,  her  past experience  in a traditional academic program had not prepared her very well for what was being described.

Her biggest shock came when she met with the instructors  for the  three courses  she was to take that semester. They  also described  a  self-directed teaching  and learning approach where she was expected to assess  her own needs and complete a learning contract for each course.  She had decided  to come to the United States to study adult education because she believed  that

## 6 Introduction

she would find the best professors there, and now they were asking her to select her own learning path. It simply did not make sense.

Alice  was  confused  for  the  first  two  weeks  of  the  semester,  and  after discussions with two of the instructors she met with her advisor who was also the instructor of the third course. Alice described how other students seemed comfortable with the teaching approach, and were even working together on learning  activities;  but she was concerned  that she would not get from  the courses what she had come to learn. After talking about the courses and the teaching  approach,  the advisor suggested that she go a little slower than she had originally planned  in the first semester, and that the two of them should meet frequently during that time . Alice agreed to drop one of the courses, and her advisor agreed to work with her on needs assessment  and to help her complete her learning contracts for the other courses.

The concept of learning contracts  proved to be perhaps the most confusing aspect of the courses  for Alice, However, discussion  with her advisor  and with the other course  instructor helped her develop a plan for learning  that followed quite closely some of the specific options described by the instructors in their course materials.  By the time the courses were finished, and after Alice had heard other students describe their own initial frustrations with the teaching  and learning process  used by the  faculty for  the adult  education program  she  had  begun  to  understand how  she  could  carry  out  learning activities by herself. She realized that she actually had learned  a great deal in both courses and that those learnings had taken her well beyond her initial skill and knowledge levels.

During  the  two  adult  education  courses  that  she  took  in  the  second semester, Alice felt much more comfortable filling out the learning contracts, although she still asked several questions of other students and her  instructors. In fact, the third course she took that semester was  not in adult education, and the teaching and learning philosophy was quite similar to what she had experienced  in her previous formal education  in Nigeria. To her surprise, she found  herself feeling  frustrated  at having to fulfill  many requirements with little relevance to what she would need professionally. This helped  her  to understand the value of a teaching approach that encourages learners to take more responsibility for  decision-making.

During the last year of her degree program, she became quite comfortable with  self-directed learning. She began  to  develop learning  plans  in adult education courses that deviated markedly from  the more structured options suggested by the instructors, She also began to assert herself more in courses outside  of  the  adult education program  by  talking with instructors  about altering course requirements to better meet her professional  needs.  By the end of her graduate program Alice had become  a successful  self-directed

learner. During her final intensive exams she described how she was going to take her new learning skills and apply them in her future  job.

While the situations of Mary, Neal, and Alice are very different, they share some  common  threads.  Each  of  them  made  a  conscious  choice  to  take responsibility  for their own learning. For each of these individuals,  selfdirection in learning has become a way of life.

The field of adult education has long embraced such ideas as autonomy, independence, and personal development of adult learners. These ideas are implicit  in  such  terms  as  lifelong  learning,  self-directed  learning, selfplanned  learning,  independent study, distance education, learning  projects, andragogy, and self-directed  learning readiness.  All of these  in some way stress the role of individual learners in the learning process.

Thus, the three examples chosen to begin this book illustrate some of the possible ways in which an individual comes  to use  self-directed  learning approaches.  There  are  in  reality many possible  routes.  In  fact,  we  have observed  that no two learners approach self-directed learning  in the same way. Perhaps this is why the concept of self-directed learning has become so popular in recent years among adult education scholars. This also is why the concept has existed in some form for hundreds  of years. The purpose of this chapter  will  be  to  describe  the phenomenon of self-direction  in  learning, which has become a way of life for a great many people.

## A HISTORICAL LOOK

In North America, many adult education scholars trace the current  interest in such topics as learning projects, andragogy, and self-directed learning to Houle's  (1961)  typology of goal, activity, and learning orientations  among adult learners, or to Johnstone  and Rivera's (1965)  seminal work on adult education participation. However, the idea of self-direction, under the guise of numerous names, has existed from  classical  antiquity to the present.  In fact,  Kulich (1970)  noted  that,  prior  to  the  widespread  development  of schools,  self-education was  the primary  way for  individuals to deal with happenings going on about  them.

Self-education, according to Kulich,  played an important part in the lives of the Greek philosophers.  Socrates described himself as a self-learner who capitalized on opportunities to learn from those around him. Plato believed that the ultimate goal of education for the young should be the development of an ability to function as a self-learner in adulthood. Aristotle  emphasized the importance of self-realization, a potential wisdom that can be developed either with or without the guidance of a teacher.

Kulich  (1970)  illustrates  numerous other  examples  of  self-education

## 8 Introduction

throughout history. Alexander the Great was said to have carried the works of Homer with him when he travelled. Caesar set time aside daily for writing and study.  Erasmus of Rotterdam's Study  of Christian Philosophy, published in  1516,  offered  guidelines for self-education. In the  seventeenth  century, Rend  Descartes,  in his Discourse  on Mind, described  how  he  abandoned formal  study at an early age and gained his education by experiencing  and observing  the  world  around him  and by  reflecting  on  these experiences. Newsom  (1977)  examined  the role  of "self-directed  lifelong  learning" in London between the years 1558-1640. He concluded  that there were many opportunities  for  self-directed  learning  during  this period  through  private tutors, lectures, books, libraries, and  schools - for those persons who  had the time and money to take advantage of these  opportunities.

Self-direction is also clearly reflected throughout the history of the United States.  Long  (1976)  addressed the history of  adult education  prior  to  the American Revolution. According to Long, the social conditions that existed in Colonial America, combined with a lack of formal educational institutions, led many persons to learn on their own during this period.

Self-directed  learners in Colonial America had a wide range of learning resources  from which to choose. They relied heavily on the "oral tradition", which was supplemented by the use of letters, diaries, and written records of the times that could be passed on orally to others. Societies and associations also provided a wide range of opportunities to self-directed adult  learners. However,  Long  puts  the  main  emphasis  on  available  printed  materials. Personal libraries were common among persons wealthy enough to afford  a collection of books. Subscription libraries, whereby patrons paid a specified amount for the use of services, made libraries accessible to a greater number of people.  Almanacs offered  the self-directed  learner in Colonial  America  a plethora of information, much as they do today.  Newspapers helped mobilize political activities leading to the Revolution, Magazines also proved to be a valuable resource  for the self-directed  learner in Colonial  America.

Benjamin Franklin was an important example of a self-directed  learner, and  some  consider  him  to be  the  "patron  saint" of  adult education  in the United  States. He was involved in discussion clubs, library  activities,  and helping others with learning efforts.  The Junto, a discussion club organized in Philadelphia in 1727 (Grattan, 1955), utilized reading and discussion  as a means for intellectual  development. Franklin's numerous contributions are, to a great extent, a result of various self-education  efforts.

Serious thinking about self-directed  learning took place some  150 years ago. For example, Craik's Pursuit of Knowledge  Under  Difficulties (1840) describes the self-directed learning  behaviors  of many people. As Six (1989a) notes, through a variety of examples Craik demonstrates:

(a)  the  practicability  of  self-directed  learning,  (b)  the  most  effective methods for self-instruction,  and (c) the potency  of  a determined  selfdirected learner in overcoming barriers to learning. Moreover, he [Craik] asserts that success or failure in an act of learning depends more upon the learner than upon  any set of circumstances in which the learner may be placed.

(Six,  1987:  26)

Another early author was Hosmer, whose 1847 work entitled Self-Education makes a distinction between what he referred to as self-initiated learning acts and other  educational  forms. His definition of self-education  is offered  in Chapter 2,

More recently,  in  1980,  Gibbons  and his colleagues  demonstrated  that self-directed  education  was  foundational  to  the  success  of  several  past notables  who had completed less formal  education than the norm  for their time. Using  a content  analysis  of their  biographies,  Gibbons, et al. (1980) studied twenty people,  including such individuals as Amelia Earhart, Harry Truman, Frank Lloyd Wright, Malcolm X, and Walt Disney.  Each of these individuals made important contributions to their field of expertise  despite  a lack of formal training beyond the high school  level.

Clearly, self-direction in learning has played an important, though sometimes easy to overlook, role in history. Today, the term and, more important, the basic ideals underlying the notion, have been embraced by educators and learners throughout the world. What are some of the reasons for this?

As we emphasize in the definition and conceptual framework that will be presented in the next chapter, we believe that self-direction in learning is a combination  of forces both within and outside the individual that stress the learner accepting ever-increasing responsibility for decisions associated with the  learning  process. Rogers  (1983)  saw  this  as  the  personal  process of learning how to learn, how to change, and how to adapt. Smith (1982) applied this concept of "learning how to learn" to the adult education field. Bruner's (1966) perspective was similar to Rogers, and to the point we are making in this book.  He goes so far as to define teaching as "the provisional state that has  as its object to make the learner ... self-sufficient"  (Bruner,  1966:  53). Kidd suggested that "the purpose of adult education,  or any kind of education, is to make the subject a continuing 'inner-directed', self-operating  learner" (Kidd, 1973: 47).

Tough (1979) is another North American scholar  associated  with selfdirected  learning because of his seminal work on adults' learning  projects. He  found  that  learners  prefer  to  assume  considerable  responsibility  for planning  and directing  their learning activities if given the choice. This has since been substantiated by many researchers. Chapter 3 will provide much

## 10 Introduction

more detail about learning projects research and its foundational importance to our current understanding of self-direction  in  learning.

Knowles (1975)  describes  several  reasons for advocating  this development of "self-directed"  skill. These  include  the following:  (a)  individuals who take initiative in learning are more likely to retain what is learned than the passive  learner; (b) taking initiative in learning is more in tune with our natural processes of psychological development; and (c) many recent educational developments actually place the responsibility  for learning right on the shoulders of learners.  Knowles provides a long-term reason  that cuts across various  cultural boundaries  and provides a rationale for why  self-direction in learning applies to a wide variety of educational  situations:

To sum up: the 'why* of self-directed  learning  is survival  -  your own survival as an individual, and also the survival of the human race.  Clearly, we are not talking here about something that would be nice or  desirable; neither are we talking  about some new educational fad. We are talking about a  basic human competence - the ability to  learn on  one's own - that has suddenly become a prerequisite for living in this new world.

(Knowles, 1975: 16-17)

We believe it is important to add that individuals will vary in their  readiness for self-direction thereby requiring varying degrees of assistance by facilitators, especially as self-directed learning skills are developing. Another point is  that  self-directed learning  will  not  always be  the best  way  to learn  for certain people.  As we have noted elsewhere, "perhaps it is more  appropriate to  think  of  self-directed  learning  as  an ideal  mode  of learning  for certain individuals and for certain  situations" (Brockett and Hiemstra, 1985:  33).

## TEN MYTHS ASSOCIATED  WITH SELF-DIRECTION IN LEARNING

As one looks at the literature of adult education that has accumulated  over the past two decades, a number of what we believe are myths or misconceptions regarding self-direction in learning have emerged. These  myths have often  added  to  the  confusion  over  the  meaning  of  self-direction  and  its implications for adult education  practice, At least ten such myths can readily be identified.  The purpose of this section is to discuss these myths and to set the scene for dispelling them throughout the remainder of the book.

## Myth 1: Self-directedness is an all or nothing concept

Some  educators  and  some  learners have  come  rushing  to  embrace  selfdirectedness as though it were finally the answer to finding fulfillment in life.

It  should  be  obvious  that  learning  styles  and  approaches  will  vary  with particular  individuals  and learning situations. In addition, as  people face new learning challenges, they  will  find  differing  needs  for  outside  assistance, personal  initiative,  and individual reflection in terms of their learning  activities.  Thus,  as we have noted  elsewhere  (Brockett and Hiemstra,  1985), self-directedness is best viewed as a continuum rather than as some  dichotomous model. Here, self-direction is viewed as a characteristic  that exists, to a greater or lesser degree, in all persons  and in all learning  situations.

The complexity of this continuum view, however, can be illustrated when looking at some of the research on cognitive styles. Even (1982), for example, notes that people who exhibit field-independent learning styles are likely to benefit  from  a self-directed  emphasis,  since field-dependent  learners  who typically require a more social orientation, are not as likely to be successful with self-initiated learning activities.  Yet, field-dependent  learners also tend to prefer more structured,  formal learning environments, which is inconsistent with much of what is typically associated with self-direction. Thus, the distinction is not  as clear cut as it may appear at  first.

The  fact  that  learners  will be  at  different  places  on  the  continuum  has implications for facilitators and for learners, especially as learners plan and carry out their educational efforts  or move toward higher levels of personal self-direction. In Chapters 6 and 7 we explore these implications.

## Myth 2: Self-direction  implies learning in  isolation

For purposes of this book, and especially in light of the teaching and learning process  detailed  in  Chapter  6,  we  are  referring  to  learning  based  on  a preference for taking individual responsibility. However, we do not necessarily equate self-direction with learning that is independent of a facilitator or of  some  outside  resource.  In  other  words, we  believe  it  is  a  mistake  to automatically associate  self-directed learning with learning  in isolation  or learning on an independent basis (Hiemstra, 1985c). Moore (1973:669) also argues that a self-directed learner is not "an  intellectual Robinson  Crusoe, castaway  and shut off  in self-sufficiency".  Brookfield  (1985c: 7)  believes this, too, noting that "it is evident that no act of learning can be  self-directed if  we understand  self-direction  as meaning the absence  of external sources of assistance".

An  assumption  often  made  by  those  looking  at  the  concept  of  selfdirectedness for the first time is that learning takes place primarily in isolation or only through limited contact with others. Some instructors believe that this would mean sending a student away from  a group or formal setting  to do independent study. Another example is the stereotype of a person  cloistered

## 12 Introduction

in the corner  of  a library  reading  a book,  or at home  using  a package  of individualized learning materials.

However, self-direction in learning does not necessarily  mean learning in isolation.  What  it does  mean is that the learner  assumes primary responsibility  for  and  control  over  decisions  about  planning,  implementing,  and evaluating the learning experience. This may happen in isolation  -  or in a large  group, or  when two or more learners  share responsibilities  for  their learning. Hiemstra(1975) and Baghi (1979), for example, found that learners often  go  to  others  as  resources  for  their  self-directed  efforts.  Brookfield (1980) also found that learners  working part of the time in isolation often come together in what he calls a "fellowship of learning"  where competition among learners is balanced with a degree of cooperation and sharing.

## Myth 3: Self-direction  is  just another adult education fad

The 1970s and 1980s in the United States, and to some extent throughout the world, have produced what some refer to as the "me"  generation, known for hedonism  and  self-centeredness.  Self-direction in learning may  be  tied  to such notions in some people's minds. In addition, the adult education  field has not been immune  from fads or from short-lived movements. Competency-based  adult learning efforts, group process  methods, and even the  "Great  Books" movement are examples of the ebb  and  flow  of  adult learner  involvement.

However, the notion of individuals taking personal responsibility for their learning  and the ideal  of a facilitator providing  guidance  for  self-directed efforts have been around for some time. As we noted earlier in this  chapter, the history of self-direction in learning is long and enduring. These  notions have been strengthened by research during the past two decades, and it is our contention that such research will continue for some time. While terms such as "self-direction in learning" or "self-directed learning" may be replaced at some point in the  future,  the emphasis on personal responsibility  and  the belief  in  the  never-ending potential of  humans will  survive  and, indeed, thrive, because they lie at the heart of adult education as a field of practice and study.

## Myth 4: Self-direction  is not worth  the time required to make it work

One myth frequently bandied about reflects beliefs that there are no  special benefits to promoting self-directedness or individualization of the  teaching and  learning process.  So why go to all the  time  and bother  necessary  for success?  In fact,  as is described in subsequent chapters, considerable  "upfront" time is required by instructors  and learners in organizing the learning

activities.  However,  we believe  that  the  benefits  far  outweigh  the  effort required  by learners  and facilitators.

For example, from our experience there appears to be a greater transfer of learning  from  one situation,  or course,  to  another  -  of both  knowledge obtained  and self-direction  skills.  These  skills enable  learners  to  diagnose needs,  secure  resources,  and carry out learning activities.  Knowles  (1975) believed  this, too,  and Skager (1979: 519) noted that an essential feature of self-directed  learners  appears  to be "a willingness  to initiate and  maintain systematic  learning  on  their  own  initiative".  We  also  believe  that  other positive  educational  results  come  from  self-direction  in  learning,  such  as increased  retention, greater interest in continued learning, greater interest in the subject,  and more positive  attitudes toward the instructor,  and we hope that this can be verified by future  research.

Another benefit is enhanced self-concept  (Brockett, 1983c; Sabbaghian, 1980).  For example, some students who are not as strong or vocal as others because  of shyness  or a lower self-concept, in the self-directed  setting  can progress  at their own rate and surpass what they might do when following the same path as everyone else, or a path set by an instructor. Thus, learning to  develop  personal  patterns  for  approaching  and  solving  problems  will enhance one's confidence and concept of self as a learner.

## Myth 5: Self-directed learning activities are limited primarily to reading and writing

We have  actually  found  quite the  opposite  to be  true.  A  wide variety  of learning activities and approaches generally are used to encourage  learners to take personal responsibility for their own learning. The following are only some of the activities used by those learners with whom we have  associated that go beyond just readings, discussions, and writings related to a subject matter:  (a)  personal  investigation  of  a  topic  using  interviews  as  a basic information  source;  (b)  self-guided  reading, where the instructor  or  some other  person  in  a mentoring role  provides  some  guidance  and  evaluative support as needed  or as required; (c) participation in a study group,  where three or more people cooperate in finding information and compiling a report on a topic through reading, research, and discussion; (d) involvement in an agency  visitation  or  study tour of  some organization;  (e) completion  of a practicum or internship in an agency or with some expert; (f)  studying a  topic through correspondence with an instructor or some expert; and (g) engaging in  a  debate  via  on-line  computer conferencing  software.  In  addition,  the literature contains  descriptions of several other individualized study methods, such as learning packages/kits, programmed instruction, and computer or electronic  assisted materials.

## 14 Introduction

## Myth 6: Facilitating self-direction is an easy way out for teachers

For  some,  self-direction implies that the  facilitator  sits  back  and takes  a passive approach to teaching. The image of the instructor who says "go ahead and do whatever you want to do" comes to mind. Taken to an extreme, this means  that  self-direction  can  be  a  "cop-out"  for  instructors  who,  either deliberately or out of ignorance, misuse the concept for their own benefit or to manipulate learners, rather than as a way to better serve them. In reality, however, the successful facilitator of self-directed learning assumes a very active role that involves negotiation, exchange of views, securing  needed resources,  and validation of outcomes.

Effective  facilitators  establish  a special  relationship  with learners  that, while sometimes painful  and frustrating  (Brookfield,  1986),  is most often rewarding for both learner and facilitator.  Hiemstra (1988a) refers to this as a  "learning  partnership"  that  must  develop  between  participants  in  the teaching-learning  transaction.  In  order  for  this  to  happen,  though,  it  is necessary to move beyond the view of the facilitator as a passive observer to one who actively works to ensure a high-quality  learning experience  and, as Brookfield (1987) notes, even the promotion of critical thinking by learners.

## Myth 7: Self-directed learning is limited primarily  to those settings where freedom  and democracy  prevail

In  some  circumstances learners  experience  external  pressures  to  learn. Incarcerated people, Adult Basic Education students, and those involved in mandatory continuing education programs, for example, typically will think much differently,  at least initially,  about their involvement  than  a person voluntarily taking an evening course or participating in a graduate program of adult education. Those who are studying  under some sort of duress or who have been used  to a teacher directed and controlled  experience may need much more time than others to accept that they can take personal  responsibility for much of their learning. In addition, as we demonstrate in Chapter 10, self-direction in  learning  takes place  in  a variety  of  societal  settings throughout the world.

There also are times  in any person's life when the desire to be self-directed will be low or difficult  to maintain.  These are times when the learner wants an instructor or some expert to give the information directly, or to present it in a well-written  booklet. However,  we believe that the value of self-directed approaches in freeing learners far outweighs any problems from slower starts or heavier loads on instructors. In fact, we have observed that authority-based approaches  frequently force individuals into learning modes that may not be conducive to maximum  learning. Thus, we hope that one of the results of this

book will be the inspiration of learners and facilitators to utilize  self-directed approaches.

## Myth 8: Self-direction in learning is limited primarily to white, middle-class  adults

Brookfield  (1984c,  1985b, 1988)  contends  that  self-directed  learning  is limited  primarily  to  white,  middle-class  adults.  Although  much  of  the research  noted in Chapters 3,4, and 5 focuses on white adults with considerable education and economic means, other research has demonstrated that various groups are capable of self-direction in learning. For example, Baghi (1979), Denys (1975), Field  (1979),  Guglielmino and Guglielmino (1983, 1988),  Hassan  (1982),  Heisel  (1985),  Long  and  Agyekum  (1983, 1984, 1988),  Penland  (1978),  Ralston  (1979, 1981),  Shackelford  (1983),  and Umoren (1978) are only some of the researchers reporting results or conclusions based on self-directed learning research with black adults.

Brockett (1985c) also responds to Brookfield's criticism and suggests that most of the considerable research on hard-to-reach adults was not included in the evidence cited by Brookfield.  Caffarella and O'Donnell also point out that the evidence goes well beyond white adults. They note (1988: 45) that various studies  confirmed "that the majority of adults, from all walks of life, are actively involved in self-directed learning projects, though the number of projects  involved  and the amount of time spent on those  projects  were quite diverse." Chapter 10  provides some illustrations of self-directed  activity in various locations  around the world and with a variety of people.

## Myth 9: Self-directed learning will erode the quality of institutional programs

It is true that many institutions  do not support self-directed learning, In some instances  this is  a result of  a lack of understanding about the potential  of self-direction in learning. In other instances, this is because they embrace the traditional notion that teachers are experts and that learners should be willing receivers of that expert knowledge. However, as Brockett (1988a) notes, that traditional outlook is safe, but also static. Such a circumstance  may make it difficult  for  teachers  and  learners  to  obtain  full  support  for  self-directed approaches, thereby potentially affecting quality.

Some learners will take advantage of a self-directed learning process and not work to their maximum. In addition, it will be difficult for some instructors to place full trust in the ability  of learners to take responsibility  for their own learning. Obviously, much of the responsibility for quality must reside with  the  learner  in  situations  where  individual  initiative  is expected.

## 16 Introduction

Fortunately,  our experience  has been that when the trust is given,  the  vast majority of learners  will work to their maximum and seek out  high-quality learning experiences.  Knowles and Associates (1984) are among the growing numbers  demonstrating  how  excellent  learning  experiences  are  possible when self-directed  attitudes prevail.

## Myth  10: Self-directed  learning is the best approach for adults

This  myth  may  appear  to  support  the book's  main  thrust.  However,  we believe it important to acknowledge potential problems in never  questioning when to use self-directed learning approaches.  Certainly we support the value of promoting self-direction in adult learning, but we recognize that there will be times when utilizing an individualized teaching approach  (we  describe how  to  individualize instruction in Chapter 6)  may not  be  appropriate  or expedient.

Collins  also  is concerned  that the facilitation of  self-directed learning, especially for individuals with restricted freedom  (i.e. prison inmates),  can become  a  vehicle  for  promoting  accommodation,  rather  than  promoting individual autonomy: "Thus, attention is diverted away from  the need for a genuine emancipatory practice of adult education on behalf  of those whose interests  are most poorly  served within existing power relations" (Collins, 1988:  107).

While Collins's philosophy  regarding the expected or suspected  use of self-directed  approaches  or  management tools  is  different  from  ours,  we believe  it  is  important  always to  ask both  practical  and ethical  questions regarding when it may not be prudent to utilize an individualizing  approach. Chapter  11 provides more discussion on some of the ethical considerations that we believe should be made.

## CONCLUSION

Self-direction  in learning is a way of life.  It is not merely a fad that fits  in with the emphasis on self-development  and self-help that have been popular over the last decade or so. Nor is it the latest in a series of current trends in adult  education  that  will  likely  pass within  a  few  years.  The  idea  of self-education  or  taking  responsibility  for  one's  own  learning  is  clearly rooted  in  history  and,  in  our  view, the current popularity  of  self-directed learning reflects the adult education field's deliberate effort to embrace these values and incorporate  them into the mainstream of practice.

In this chapter, we have identified  and attempted to dispel several  myths relative to self-direction in learning. These myths have grown largely out of a  misunderstanding of what self-direction in adult learning  is about.  The

remainder of the  book is intended to  replace misconceptions  with information and to  raise questions that can guide us toward a future wherein  self-dkection is, in fact, clearly in the mainstream of adult education theory, research, and practice,

## 2 A conceptual framework for understanding self-direction in adult learning

Self-direction  in  learning  is  a way  of  life.  This  idea, which  served  as  the backdrop for Chapter  1, may be self-evident  to many readers. Yet much of what we do as educators of adults  runs contrary to this basic idea. The myths presented  in Chapter 1  illustrate  some of the ways in which we, as educators, sometimes misunderstand or misuse our roles in a way that may run contrary to this "way of life." It is our view that much of this misunderstanding  and misuse is due, in large part, to confusion that exists relative to what is meant by self-direction in adult learning.

In this chapter, we work to alleviate some of this confusion by providing a conceptual  framework that can help to clarify the concept of  self-direction relative to the process of adult learning. We begin by looking at various ways in which self-direction and related concepts have been defined. We then offer our  own definition of self-direction in adult learning.  Finally,  we share  a conceptual  framework  that emphasizes distinctions  between  self-directed learning as an instructional method and learner self-direction as a personality characteristic.

## SELF-DIRECTION IN ADULT LEARNING: A MISUNDERSTOOD CONCEPT

As with so many of the ideas found  within the study and practice of adult education, self-direction in learning is fraught with  confusion. This confusion is  compounded  by  the  many related concepts  that  are  often  used  either interchangeably or in a similar way. Examples include self-directed  learning, self-planned learning, self-teaching, autonomous  learning, independent study,  and  distance  education. Yet  these  terms offer  varied,  though often subtly different,  emphases. To illustrate these differences, several  views of self-direction can be compared and contrasted.

## An early view of  self-education

In  the nineteenth  century, Hosmer  (1847)  described  self-education  in the following way:

The common opinion seems to be that self-education is distinguished  by nothing but the manner of its acquisition. It is thought to denote  simply acquirements made without  a teacher, or at all events without oral instruction  advantages  always  comprehended  in  the  ordinary  cause  of education. But this merely negative circumstance, however important..., is only one of several particulars  equally  characteristic of self-education.... Besides the  absence  of many, or  all of the usual facilities for  learning, there are at least three things  peculiar  to this enterprise, namely: the longer time required, the wider range of studies, and the higher character  of its object.

(Hosmer, 1847: 42)

## A lifelong learning perspective

It is important to think of self-direction in learning from  a lifelong learning perspective.  Lifelong learning, as  will  be  noted  in  Chapter  8,  is  not  the exclusive domain of  adult educators; it refers  to learning that takes  place across the entire lifespan. This view is supported by Kidd in the following passage: "It has often been said that the purpose of adult education, or of any kind  of  education,  is  to  make  the  subject  a  continuing,  'inner-directed* self-operating learner" (Kidd, 1973: 47).

Another way of looking  at self-directed learning has been provided  by Mocker  and  Spear  (1982).  Using  a  2  x  2  matrix,  based  on  learner  vs. institution control  over the objectives (purposes)  and means (processes) of learning,  Mocker  and  Spear  identify  four  categories  comprising  lifelong learning: formal, where "learners  have no  control  over  the  objectives  or means of their learning"; nonformal, where "learners control the objectives but not the means"; informal, where "learners control the means but not the objectives";  and self-directed, where "learners  control both  the objectives and the means" (Mocker and Spear, 1982: 4).

## Self-directed  learning and schooling

Looking  at self-direction as it relates to schooling for young people,  DeliaDora and Blanchard offer  the following view:

Self-directed learning refers to characteristics of schooling which should

## 20 Introduction

distinguish  education in a democratic society  from  school in  autocratic societies.

(Delia-Dora  and Blanchard, 1979:  1)

However, in describing  the nature of self-education, Gibbons  and Phillips offer  a different view of self-education and  schooling:

Self-education occurs outside of formal institutions, not inside them. The skills  can  be  taught  and  practiced  in  schools,  teachers  can  gradually transfer the authority and responsibility for self-direction to students, and self-educational  acts can be simulated, but self-education can only truly occur when people are not compelled to learn and others are  not compelled to teach them -  especially  not to teach them a particular  subject-matter curriculum. While schools can prepare students  for a life of self-education, true self-education can only occur when a person  chooses to learn what he can also decide not to learn.

(Gibbons and Phillips,  1982: 69)

This second view reinforces the idea of learning as a lifelong process. Though the focus of this book is on self-direction in learning during adulthood,  it is important to recognize  that self-direction is not restricted  solely  to  learning in the adult years.

## A learning process  perspective

Self-direction in adulthood has often been described as a learning process, with specific phases, in which the learner assumes primary control.  Tough (1979), for instance,  has emphasized  the concept  of self-planned learning. His  research  was  concerned  with  a  specific  portion  of  the  process:  the "planning and deciding" aspects of learning.

Using  the  related  concept  of  the  "autonomous  learner,"  Moore has described  such an individual as one who can do the following:

identify his learning need when he finds a problem to be solved, a skill to be acquired, or information to be obtained. He is able to articulate his need in the form of a general goal, differentiate  that goal into several  specific objectives, and define fairly explicitly his criteria for successful  achievement. In implementing his need, he gathers the information he desires, collects ideas, practices skills, works  to resolve his  problems, and achieves his goals. In evaluating, the learner judges the appropriateness  of newly acquired skills, the adequacy of his solutions, and the quality of his new ideas and knowledge.

(Moore,  1980:  23)

Still  another  view  of  self-direction that  stresses  the phases of  a  learning process has been offered by Knowles. His view has been perhaps the most frequently used in the adult education literature to date:

In its broadest  meaning,  'self-directed  learning* describes a process in which individuals take the initiative, with or without the help of others, in diagnosing their learning needs, formulating learning goals, identifying human and material resources  for learning, choosing  and implementing appropriate learning strategies, and evaluating learning outcomes.

(Knowles, 1975: 18)

## An evolving perspective

Not only do individuals differ in their views of self-direction in learning, but each individual's view is likely to change over time. Thus, when considering definitions, it is  not only necessary to  understand who has offered a  particular definition, but when it was offered.  This evolutionary process can be illustrated  through the writings of Stephen  Brookfield. For  example, in  1980, Brookfield used the term "independent  adult learning" to describe a process that  takes place  in situations  "when  the decisions  about intermediate and terminal learning goals to be pursued, rate of student progress,  evaluative procedures to be employed, and sources of material to be consulted are in the hands of the learner" (Brookfield, 1980: 3).

Subsequently,  as  Brookfield  began  to  contribute his ideas about self-direction  to  the  North American  adult education  literature,  the  term "self-directed  learning"  started to appear in his writing. In using this term, Brookfield (1984c) noted the need to recognize differences between "learning" and  "education".  Citing  various  authors  who  had  addressed  this distinction (e.g. Jensen, 1960; Verner, 1964; Little, 1979; andBoshier, 1983), Brookfield  (1984c:  61)  noted  that  learning has  been  used  alternately  to describe "an internal change in consciousness ... an alteration in the state of the central nervous system" as well as "a range of activities ... equivalent to the act of learning".  In this view, the former is used interchangeably with learning while the latter is used in a way similar to education.

Most  recently,  Brookfield has  expressed  this  concern  about  semantic ambiguity to the extent that, instead of using the term "self-directed  learning," he is "reverting  to talking about the complex phenomenon of learning (as an internal change of consciousness) and making a distinction between this phenomenon and the educational setting or mode in which such learning occurs" (Brookfield, 1988:16). While some may disparage writers who  make such drastic  changes  in stance  over  time, we  applaud Brookfield's  effort since, although we do not agree with his recent view that the adult education

## 22 Introduction

field should abandon its enthusiasm for the concept of self-directed  learning, Brookfield  demonstrates  a willingness  to accommodate  new insights and information  and to modify his position accordingly. Indeed, the conceptual framework presented  later in this chapter reflects the evolution of our own thinking about self-direction over the past several years.

## INSTRUCTIONAL METHOD OR PERSONALITY CHARACTERISTIC?

As  has  been  noted earlier, most efforts to understand self-direction in learning to date have centered  on the notion of an instructional process in which the learner  assumes  a primary role  in planning,  implementing,  and  evaluating the experience. Yet this view becomes weakened when considered in relation to semantic and conceptual concerns such as those raised by Brookfield. One of the first authors to address the confusion over the meaning of self-directed learning was Kasworm, who stated that self-directed learning can be viewed as  a  "set  of  generic,  finite  behaviors;  as  a  belief  system  reflecting  and evolving from a process of self-initiated learning activity; or as an ideal state of the mature self-actualized learner" (Kasworm, 1983:1). At about the same time, Chene addressed the concept of autonomy, which she largely  equated with self-directed  learning.  Chene  distinguished  between  two meanings  of autonomy, where one view is psychological  and the other "is related  to a methodology which either assumes that the learner is autonomous or aims at achieving  autonomy through training" (Chene, 1983:  40).

Clearly, the  concern  over  what is meant by  self-directed  learning  is a relevant one. Take, for example, the researcher who is interested in studying self-directedness  as  an  internal  change  process,  but  who  operationalizes self-directed  learning  as an instructional process. While  there  are definite similarities between the two concepts, the ideas are not the same. In fact, as will be noted in Chapter 4, this has been a problem in much of the research on self-direction conducted to date.

During  a period  of  about  one  year,  three  authors  tried  to  clarify  the meaning of self-directed learning. Brookfield (1984c), as was noted  earlier, used an argument presented by Boshier (1983) to point out that ambiguity of the term self-directed learning might  be linked to confusion between learning (an internal change process) and education (a process for managing external conditions that facilitate this internal change). In this view, the term "self-directed learning" might best be reserved for the former while the latter would actually be viewed as "self-directed education."

At about the same time, Fellenz made a distinction between self-direction as a learning process  and as an aspect of personal development, According to Fellenz, self-direction can be viewed in one of two ways:

either as  arole adopted during the  process of learning or as a  psychological state attained by an individual in personal development. Both factors can be viewed as developed abilities and, hence, analyzed both as to how they are learned and how they affect  self-directed learning efforts.

(Fellenz,  1985:164)

In building the link between self-direction and personal development,  Fellenz  draws  from  such  concepts  as  inner-directedness  (Riesman,  1950), self-actualization (Maslow, 1954), locus of control (Rotter, 1966), autonomy (Erikson, 1964), and field independence (Witkin, et al 1971).

A third effort  to clarify  the concept of self-direction was made by Oddi (1984, 1985), who reported  the development of a new instrument designed to identify what she refers to as "self-directed continuing learners". The Oddi Continuing Learning Inventory (OCLI), a 24-item Likert scale, grew out of Oddi's concern  over the lack of a theoretical foundation for understanding personality characteristics of self-directed continuing learners. The development of this instrument, which will be discussed more fully in Chapter 4, was an outgrowth of the need to distinguish between personality  characteristics of self-directed learners and the notion of self-directed learning as "a process of self-instruction" (Oddi, 1985: 230). This distinction is not unlike the one made by Chene (1983) relative to the concept of autonomy.

In a subsequent article, Oddi (1987) distinguished between the "process perspective" and the "personality perspective" relative  to self-directed learning, suggesting that the process perspective has been the most predominant in discussions of research and practice to date. As will be shown later in this chapter, this distinction between process and personality perspectives lies at the heart of the model we will present.

Finally,  Candy  (1988)  has  offered further support  for  a  distinction between concepts. In a critical analysis  of the term "self-direction"  through a review of literature and synthesis of research findings, Candy concluded that  self-direction  has  been  used  "(i)  as  a  personal  quality  or  attribute (personal  autonomy); (ii)  as  the  independent pursuit of  learning  outside formal instructional settings (autodidaxy); and (iii) as a way of  organizing instruction (learner-control)" (Candy, 1988: 1033A). Thus, Candy is essentially  taking  the  distinction  even  further  by  differentiating  between  the learning process  taking place both  within and outside of  the  institutional setting.

Clearly, the concept of self-directed learning has undergone close scrutiny over the past  several  years. What has emerged is an important  distinction between the process of self-directed learning and the notion of self-direction as a personality construct. This distinction needs careful consideration if we are to move ahead with the study and practice of the phenomenon.

## 24 Introduction

## SELF-DIRECTION IN LEARNING AS AN UMBRELLA CONCEPT

As we have noted, the idea of self-directed learning has undergone considerable  evolution  over  the  past  several  years.  Indeed,  this  evolution  can sometimes  be seen in the case of a single author, as has been the case with Brookfield.  It  can  also  be  seen  in  the  subtle  changes  resulting  from  the research of many individuals over several years. Like Brookfield's, our own notions of self-directed  learning have evolved over time. The following two definitions are indicative of our earlier thinking about the  concept:

Self-planned learning A learning  activity that is self-directed,  selfinitiated, and frequently carried out alone.

(Hiemstra, 1976a: 39)

and

Broadly defined, self-directed learning refers to activities where primary responsibility  for planning, carrying out, and evaluating a learning endeavor is assumed by the individual learner.

(Brockett, 1983b: 16)

Unlike Brookfield,  however, instead of advocating movement away from the concept, we embrace the view that what is needed is to expand the concept and to encourage its continued development as a central theme in the  field of  adult education. However, it is our belief that in doing this, we need  to move away from overemphasis on the term "self-directed learning." Instead, given  the  confusion  over  self-directed  learning  as  instructional method versus personality  characteristic, we suggest that the term self-direction in learning can provide  the breadth needed  to reflect more  fully  the  current understanding of the concept.

In our view, self-direction  in learning refers to two distinct  but  related dimensions.  The first of these  dimensions is a process in which  a learner assumes primary responsibility  for planning, implementing,  and evaluating the learning process. An education agent or resource often plays a facilitating role  in  this  process.  This  is  the  notion  of self-directed learning as  it  has generally  been used in  the professional literature. The  second  dimension, which we refer  to as learner self-direction, centers on a learner's desire or preference  for assuming responsibility for learning. This is the personality aspect  discussed  earlier. Thus, self-direction in learning refers to both the external characteristics of an instructional process  and the internal  characteristics of the learner, where the individual assumes primary  responsibility for  a  learning  experience.  The  remainder  of  this  chapter  will  center  on discussion of a model designed to clarify  this definition further.

## THE PRO MODEL: A FRAMEWORK FOR UNDERSTANDING SELF-DIRECTION IN ADULT LEARNING

If the idea of self-direction  in learning is viewed as comprising  both instructional method processes (self-directed learning) and personality characteristics of  the  individual  (learner  self-direction),  it  is important  to consider how these two dimensions are related. As a way of illustrating  this relationship,  we  propose  a  model  that  distinguishes  between  these  two dimensions while at the same time recognizing  that the two dimensions are inextricably linked to a broader view of self-direction. This model, which we refer  to  as  the  "Personal  Responsibility  Orientation"  (PRO)  model  of self-direction  in adult learning is designed to recognize both the differences and similarities  between self-directed learning as an instructional method and learner self-direction as a personality characteristic.  The model is not only intended to serve as a way of better understanding self-direction,  it can also serve as a framework for building future theory, research,  and practice. The major components of the PRO model, as illustrated in Figure 2.1, are outlined on the following pages.

## Personal responsibility as a central  concept

As  can  be  seen  in  Figure  2,1,  the  point  of  departure  for  understanding self-direction in adult learning, according to the PRO model, is the notion of personal responsibility. By personal responsibility we mean that individuals assume ownership for their own thoughts  and actions. Personal  responsibility does not necessarily  mean control over personal  life circumstances or environment.  However,  it does mean  that  a  person  has  control  over  how  to respond to a situation. As summarized by Elias and Merriam (1980:  118), behavior "is the consequence of human choice which individuals can  freely exercise*'. For instance,  oppressed  people  typically lack  control  over  their social environment; however, they can choose how they will respond  to the environment. They can resign themselves to accepting the status quo or they can choose to act in a way designed to alter the current situation. In the latter case,  while the outcome may not always be what is desired, the decision to act in a certain  way reflects a choice not to willingly  accept "the way things are*'. Within the  context of learning, it is the  ability and/or  willingness  of individuals to take control of their own learning that determines their potential for self-direction.

Drawing largely on assumptions of humanistic philosophy,  we base this emphasis on personal responsibility  on two ideas. First, we embrace the view that human nature is basically good  and that individuals possess virtually unlimited potential for growth. Second, we believe that only by  accepting

responsibility  for  one's  own  learning  is  it  possible  to  take  a  proactive approach  to the learning process.  These  assumptions  imply  a great  deal of faith  and trust in the learner and, thus, offer  a foundation for the notion of personal responsibility  relative to learning.

Perhaps another way of understanding what we mean by personal responsibility can be found  in the idea of autonomy, as discussed  by Chene,  who provides the following  perspective:

Autonomy means  that one can  and does  set one's own rules,  and can choose for oneself  the norms one will respect.  In other words, autonomy refers  to one's ability to choose  what has value, that is to say, to make choices in harmony with  self-realization.

(Chene,  1983:  39)

Autonomy, as defined above, assumes that one will take personal  responsibility, because one  is  independent  "from all exterior regulations and constraints" (Chene, 1983: 39),

While  we envision  personal  responsibility as the cornerstone  of  selfdirection in learning, it is important to stress three related points. First, while we emphasize our commitment to the view that human potential is unlimited, we believe that each individual assumes some degree of personal responsibility. It is not  an either/or characteristic. Thus, adult learners will possess different  degrees  of  willingness to accept  responsibility  for  themselves  as learners.  As was noted  in the last chapter, it is a misconception  to  assume that  learners  necessarily enter  a learning  experience  with  a high  level  of self-direction  already intact. Self-direction  is not a panacea  for all problems associated  with adult learning. Nor is it always necessary  for one to be highly self-directed  in order  to be a successful learner. However, if being  able  to assume greater control for one's destiny is a desirable goal of adult education (and we believe it is!), then a role for educators of adults is to help  learners become  increasingly  able to assume personal  responsibility  for their  own learning.

Second,  the  emphasis  on personal  responsibility  as the  cornerstone  of self-direction  in  learning  implies  that  the  primary  focus  of  the  learning process is on the individual, as opposed to the larger society. Yet,  accepting responsibility for one's actions as a learner does not ignore the social context in which the learning  takes place.  Such a view would be extremely  shortsighted. What personal  responsibility does mean, however, is that the point of  departure for understanding learning lies within the individual. Once this individual dimension is recognized, it is then important to examine the social dimensions that impact upon the learning process.  And related  to this point is a belief that someone who assumes personal responsibility as an individual is in a stronger position  to also be more socially  responsible.

## 28 Introduction

Finally, it is important to point out that in taking responsibility  for one's thoughts and actions,  one also assumes responsibility  for the consequences of  those  actions.  As  Rogers  (1961:  171)  has  stated,  to be "self-directing means that one chooses -  and then learns from  the consequences." Within the context  of  adult education, Day (1988)  has used  fictional  literature  to illustrate  this point.  Drawing  from  the works Oedipus Rex, Martin  Eden, Pygmalion, and Educating Rita, Day argues that adults are  "decision-making beings" who are "ultimately responsible" for the decisions  they make, that the "results of our learning experiences may as likely lead to discontent  as to a state of well-being", and that in general "learning produces consequences" (Day,  1988:  125).

In conclusion,  the notion of personal  responsibility,  as we are using it in the PRO model, means that learners have choices  about the directions they pursue as learners.  Along with this goes  a responsibility  for accepting  the consequences of one's thoughts and actions as a learner. The idea of personal responsibility will be further developed throughout the book, particularly in Chapter 7, where the theoretical underpinnings of learner self-direction  are explored.

## Self-directed  learning: the process  orientation

Self-directed  learning,  as  we  have  come  to  view  the  term,  refers  to  an instructional method. It is a process that centers on the activities of  planning, implementing, and evaluating learning. Most of the writings and research on self-directed  and self-planned learning from the early and mid-1970s were developed from  this perspective (e.g., Knowles, 1975; Tough,  1979).  Similarly, the definitions of self-directed learning that we have used previously (Hiemstra, 1976a; Brockett, 1983a) stress this process  orientation.  Further, one of us (Hiemstra, 1988a; Hiemstra and Sisco,  1990) has described this as individualizing the teaching and learning  process.

The  process  orientation  of  self-direction  in  adult learning  focuses  on characteristics  of the teaching-learning  transaction. Thus, when  considering this aspect of self-direction, concern revolves around factors external to the individual. Needs assessment, evaluation,  learning resources, facilitator roles and skills, and independent study are a few of the concepts  that fall within the domain of the self-directed  learning process. The illustrations compiled in recent books by Knowles and Associates (1984) and Brookfield (1985a) exemplify  this concept of self-directed  learning as an instructional  process in  such  areas  as  human  resource  development,  continuing professional education,  graduate and  undergraduate study,  and  community  education. Given  the  distinction between learning and education made earlier  in the chapter,  some  readers  may  wish  to  think  of  this  process  orientation  as

"self-directed education". We do not disagree with this term, but choose to refer to the process as "self-directed  learning" in order to stress  the link  to the foundation laid by Knowles. Chapter 6 offers a closer look at the  process orientation  of self-directed learning,

## Learner self-direction:  the personal  orientation

While most  of  the  work  that  has  been  seminal to  the  foundation  of self-direction  in learning  has focused on the process  orientation  described above, the importance of understanding characteristics of successful self-directed learners  has  generally  been  stressed  as  well.  For  instance, Knowles  (1970) identified  several  assumptions  underlying  the concept of andragogy as a model for helping adults learn, The first of these  assumptions was that the self-concept  of adult learners is characterized  by  self-direction, whereas  dependence  characterizes  the  self-concept  of  the child.  Knowles (1980) later revised his view of pedagogy and andragogy from a dichotomy to a continuum. However, his emphasis on self-concept reflects the centrality of personality  as an element of self-direction in learning. This emphasis  on personality  characteristics  of the learner, or factors internal to the individual, is what we refer to as the "personal  orientation" or learner  self-direction.

Thus, in our view, learner self-direction refers to characteristics  of an individual that predispose  one  toward talcing primary responsibility  for  personal learning  endeavors.  Conceptually, the  notion of  learner self-direction  grows largely from ideas addressed by Rogers (1961,1983), Maslow (1970), and other writers  from  the  area  of  humanistic psychology.  Evidence  of  this  personal orientation  can  be  found  in  much  of  the  research  on  self-direction  in adult learning since the late 1970s, For instance, self-directedness has been studied in  relation  to  such  variables  as  creativity  (Torrance  and  Mourad, 1978), self-concept (Sabbaghian, 1980), life satisfaction (Brockett,  1983c,  1985a), intellectual  development  (Shaw,  1987),  and  hemisphericity  (Blackwood, 1989).  Learner  self-direction is discussed further in Chapter 7.

## Self-direction in learning: the vital link

As we pointed out earlier, self-direction in learning  is a term that we use as an umbrella  concept  to  recognize  both  external  factors  that  facilitate  the learner taking primary responsibility for planning, implementing, and evaluating learning, and  internal  factors  or  personality characteristics that predispose one  toward  accepting  responsibility  for  one's  thoughts  and actions  as  a  learner,  The  PRO  model  illustrates this  distinction  between external  and  internal  forces,  At  the  same  time  it  recognizes, through  the notion  of personal responsibility,  that there is a strong connection  between

## 30 Introduction

self-directed  learning and learner self-direction. This connection  provides  a key to understanding the success of self-direction in a given learning context.

It was noted in Chapter 1  that one of the myths related to self-direction  in learning is that it is an "all-or-nothing" characteristic.  In our view, both the internal and external aspects of self-direction can be viewed on a continuum. Thus, a given learning  situation will fit somewhere within a range relative to opportunity for self-directed learning and, similarly, an individual's  level of self-directedness will fall somewhere within a range of possible levels. Related to this view of self-direction as a continuum is our belief that it is a mistake to consider high self-direction as ideal in all learning situations. As we have noted previously, because of "the great diversity that exists both in learning  styles  and in reasons  for learning,  it is extremely short-sighted  to advance" the view that self-direction  is the best way to learn and that instead, it is more desirable to think of self-direction  as "an ideal mode of learning for  certain  individuals and for certain situations"  (Brockett and Hiemstra, 1985:  33).  It is this point  that serves  to link  the  concepts  of  self-directed learning and learner self-direction.

We suggest that optimal conditions  for learning result when there is a balance, or congruence, between the learner's level of self-direction and the extent to which opportunity for self-directed learning is possible  in a given situation. If, for example, one is predisposed toward a high level of self-directedness  and is engaged in a learning experience  where self-direction  is actively facilitated,  chances for success are high. Similarly, the learner who is  not  as  high  in  self-directedness is  likely  to  find  comfort  and,  in  all likelihood,  a greater chance  of success  in a situation where the  instructor assumes a more directive role. In both instances, the chances for success are relatively  high,  since  the  learner's  expectations  are  congruent  with  the conditions of the learning situation.

Where  difficulties  and  frustrations  arise  is  when  the  balance  between internal  characteristics  of  the  learner  are  not  in  harmony  with  external characteristics  of the teaching-learning  transaction. Individuals who enter a learning situation with a clear idea of how and what they wish to learn are likely  to  become  frustrated  and disenchanted  if  not  given  the  freedom  to pursue these directions. In the same vein, the learner who seeks a high level of guidance and direction will probably have similar feelings in a situation where the facilitator emphasizes an active  leadership role by the learners. For individuals  in  either  situation,  the  problem  is  that  the  teaching-learning situation  is not  in  harmony with  the needs  and desires  which  the  learner brought to the situation. This does not mean that the learner was "unsuccessful", nor that the facilitator was "ineffective". Rather, it suggests that success and effectiveness are relative terms that depend on clear communication of

needs and expectations among  all parties engaged in the teaching-learning transaction,

The notion  of learner  self-direction,  as an element  of the  PRO  model, suggests  a general  tendency  that exists  to a greater  or lesser degree  in all learners.  However,  it is important  to recognize that  situational factors are often likely to impact on the type of instructional method a learner will seek. An adult who seeks to learn about current trends in real estate,  for example, may be willing to relinquish control over the learning situation to the session leader for reasons of expedience or because of a personal  lack of knowledge and experience  in the real estate area. This does not diminish  the learner's level of self-direction;  indeed, the decision  to relinquish a degree of  control was consciously  made by the learner.

Several years ago, the first  author attended a research  conference  where participants met to exchange information and ideas based on current research. The format for this conference, as is often the case for research  conferences, was a series of paper sessions  and symposia consisting of formal presentations  followed  by  questions  and  discussions  from  the  audience.  In  one symposium, the  first  presenter  began  by  discussing some  of  the  research trends in the topical area under consideration.  However, about 20 minutes later,  the  second  presenter  began  his portion of the symposium by  asking participants  to move their chairs into a circle so that it would be easier  to "share ideas." At least half of the group exercised a degree of self-direction by immediately leaving the room.

The above examples have been presented to illustrate two points.  First, self-directed  learning -  the method that the second  presenter  was trying to implement -  is not inherently the best method for adult learning.  Although we believe that self-directed learning situations will most often be compatible with the needs,  desires,  and capabilities of adult learners, there are times when  a  highly  teacher-directed  approach  will prove  most  effective  and, indeed, will be expected and even demanded.

Second,  when  considering  the  fit  between  self-directed  learning  and learner  self-direction, it  is important to keep  in  mind that  the  congruence between these dimensions may at times be mitigated by factors such as the expectations of the learners. That symposium presenter must certainly have felt  a degree of frustration  and perhaps hurt as half of the audience  walked out on his efforts  to create a climate that most likely had served  him very well  in  other  settings.  However,  it  is  likely  that  the  lack  of  congruence between his  approach  and the context in  which  the learning  situation  was taking place is what led to the exodus of so many participants.  This  brings us to a final element of the PRO model, which is a consideration of the social context in which self-direction  in learning exists.

## 32 Introduction

## The social context for self-direction  in learning

The final element of the PRO model is represented by the circle  encompassing the other elements.  One of the most frequent criticisms of  self-direction in learning  has been  an overemphasis  on the individual, which  is usually accompanied  by a failure to consider  the social context  in which  learning takes place.  Brookfield, for example, has suggested  that by "concentrating attention  on  the  features  of  individual  learner  control  over  the  planning, conduct and evaluation of learning, the importance of learning networks and informal learning exchanges has been forgotten"  (Brookfield, 1984c: 67). In the  PRO  model,  the  individual learner  is,  in  fact, central to  the  idea  of self-direction. However, such learning activities cannot be divorced  from the social  context in which they occur. This point is further reinforced  through discussions  on  the  role  of  institutions  in  Chapter  8  and  policy  issues  in Chapter 9. We agree with Brookfield that social  context is vital to understanding  self-direction  and  that,  to  date,  this  concern  has  largely  been overlooked.  Brookfield's  (1981b)  own  research,  in  which  he  found  that "independent adult learners" often  function  as a "fellowship of learning" is a  noteworthy  exception  to  this  gap  in  knowledge. One  of  the  myths of self-direction  identified in  Chapter  1 is  that  such  learning  takes  place  in isolation. In order to truly understand the impact of self-direction, both as an instructional  method  and  as  a  personality  characteristic,  it  is  crucial  to recognize  the social milieu in which such activity transpires.

Related to the social context are the political implications of  self-direction in  learning.  Again,  Brookfield (1984c)  has  helped  to raise consciousness about  the politics  of  self-direction. This,  in  turn,  triggered  the  following response:

Brookfield's  comments are most insightful,  for they force us to ponder the real consequences  of situations where learners are truly in control of their  learning  ....  many individuals, especially  those  who  can be  considered "hard-to-reach", may believe that formal educational settings can reinforce  conformity while stifling creativity. For such persons, institutions may be perceived as antithetical to the self-directed learning process. On a larger scale, these issues are amplified  in situations where individuals view themselves as powerless in determining the direction of their lives. What  are  the  potential  consequences  ... of promoting  self-direction  in societies where individual  human  rights may be in question? Clearly, the issue of control is a crucial one because, ultimately, it must move beyond the individual dimension into the social and political  arenas.

(Brockett, 1985c: 58)

Thus, while the individual is the "starting point" for understanding self-di-

rection in adult learning, the social context provides the arena in which the activity of self-direction is played out. In order for us to truly understand the phenomenon of self-direction in adult learning, it will be crucial to recognize and deal with the interface between these individual and social dimensions. Chapters  8  and 10  address  the  social context from institutional and cross-cultural perspectives, respectively.

## CONCLUSION

In  this  chapter,  we  have  attempted  to  alleviate  some  of  the  confusion surrounding the meaning of self-direction and related concepts. By  proposing the PRO model, we are suggesting that in order to understand the complexity of  self-direction  in  adult learning,  it  is  essential  to recognize  differences between self-directed learning as an instructional method and learner selfdirection  as a personality characteristic.  These two dimensions are linked through  the  recognition  that each  emphasizes the  importance  of  learners assuming personal responsibility for their thoughts and actions. Finally, the PRO model is designed to advance  understanding  of self-direction by recognizing the vital role played  by the social context in which  learning takes  place. Moving to a critical examination of research on self-direction in the next two chapters, the remainder of the book is designed to further illuminate the ideas expressed in the PRO model.

## Part II

## The underlying knowledge base

Since the early  1970s,  few if any topics have been the focus of more study in adult education than self-direction in learning. In looking at the knowledge base of self-direction, this part is divided into three chapters, each of which examines a different stream of research. In Chapter 3, studies growing out of Allen  Tough's  seminal  work  on  adult's  learning  projects  are  presented. Through this research, it became clear that self-planning is the most frequent approach  adults take in their learning  efforts.

As researchers  became more enthusiastic about the potential  of studying self-direction,  efforts  were undertaken  to  find  ways to  measure  levels  of self-directedness  among  learners. To date, two instruments  have  been  the primary vehicles for such studies. These are reviewed  in Chapter 4.

The next chapter, 5, considers studies on self-direction based  on naturalistic research and qualitative data. These studies have added considerably  to how  the  process  of  self-directed learning  is undertaken  and  to the  social context in which such learning takes place.

Together, the studies presented in the three chapters of Part II fill in many pieces  of  the  puzzle  that  is  self-direction  in  adult  learning.  But,  more important, they help to provide an understanding  of where holes still exist in the knowledge  base.

## 3 Adult learning as an iceberg: establishing the  knowledge base on self-direction

As was stressed in Chapter  1, self-direction in learning is not a  new idea. Yet, while  self-direction  or  self-education has  been  held  as  an  ideal  for  adult education by various authors over the past several decades (e.g., Lindeman, 1926;  Bryson,  1936;  Snedden,  1930), only since the early 1970s have adult education  researchers actively  and  systematically  directed their efforts toward this area. This may be due, in part, to the relative newness  of adult education  as a field of study in North America. While  some  authors  (e.g., Boshier  and Pickard,  1979;  Boyd  and  Apps,  1980)  have  described  adult education as a  "discipline," the idea of adult education as an area of academic inquiry  is nonetheless  quite recent. In fact, much of the  seminal  thinking about the study of the adult education field can be traced to the  publication of Adult  Education:  Outlines  of  an  Emerging  Field  of  University  Study (Jensen, et al., 1964). Further, a content analysis of Adult Education (Dickinson  and  Rusnell,  1971)  revealed  that during the  mid-to-late  1960s,  the number of descriptive/opinion-oriented  articles declined  while the number of  original  research  articles  increased.  We  suggest  that  self-direction  in learning, therefore, has actually been one of the first major areas within the field  to  undergo  systematic  and  sustained  inquiry.  Indeed,  Beder  (1985) supported  this view by suggesting that, along with the area of participation, self-direction has been the only other research area to be extensively examined within adult education.

Another possible  reason  for the relatively recent  emphasis  on selfdirection  as a research  area is the  inherent  difficulty  of  studying  learners outside  of  educational  institutions. Since  so  many  self-directed  learning efforts  take place outside of institutions, it can be quite difficult  to examine self-directedness  in a holistic way that considers social,  cultural,  political, and psychological dimensions of the concept. As will  be demonstrated in this chapter, the knowledge base of self-direction in adult learning  has  evolved largely through the efforts of researchers to identify numerous,  often creative,

## 38 The underlying knowledge base

strategies for  answering  questions  about  the  frequency  and  nature  ofself-directed  learning.

While efforts to study self-direction in learning have escalated since the early  1970s,  one individual who seems to have played a key role in laying the groundwork for this research as far back as the early 1960s is Cyril Houle. In addition to serving  as major professor  for Malcolm  Knowles and Allen Tough,  two of the seminal contributors  to current  thought on  self-direction in learning,  Houle is author of The Inquiring Mind, first published in 1961. For  this  study,  sometimes  credited  with  sparking  the  current  interest  in self-direction, Houle interviewed twenty-two adult learning participants  in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, during 1960. Using an informal interview schedule, he concluded that these individuals  fell  within three subgroups  with regard to  their  reasons  for  engaging in a continuing education  activity. The first group,  which  Houle  called goal-oriented, consisted of  individuals  who viewed  their participation  as  a  means to  some  other  end,  such  as  career advancement  or  change.  A  second  group,  the activity-oriented, chose  to participate  in continuing  education primarily for fellowship, or the opportunity  to meet new  people,  Finally, a group  that Houle referred  to as the learning-oriented, was  comprised  of individuals  who participated  for  the sake of personal enjoyment; these individuals viewed learning  as an end in and  of  itself.  As  will  be  discussed  later  in  the  chapter,  it  is  this  latter orientation that led Tough to pursue an interest in what he initially referred to as "adult self-teachers."

The  focus of this  and the following  two  chapters  will be  a review and critical  analysis of existing research  related to self-direction  in learning.  In this  chapter,  we  will  introduce  what  we  believe  to  be  the  three  major directions that research in this area has taken to date. We will then highlight the first of these areas. In the following two chapters, we will look at each of the other two major research directions and will offer  an assessment  of the current  state  of  this  research  area.  Subsequent  chapters  will  apply  this knowledge  to  examine  ways  in  which  adult  educators  can  utilize  these findings in order to improve practice.

## THREE STREAMS OF INQUIRY

Despite  the relatively recent  emergence of  self-direction in learning  as a research direction for adult education, the picture resulting from this body of knowledge seems rather bright. Unlike  many of the researchable areas within the field that  have been largely  unexplored,  deliberate  efforts have been made to bridge theory, research, and practice in self-direction. As a result, it has been possible  to apply information gained from  research both  to improve practice  and  to  further  expand  research  and  theory-building efforts.  For

example, in the twenty issues of Adult Education Quarterly appearing during the 5-year period  between Fall,  1984 and Summer 1989,  a total of sixteen articles  dealt  directly  with  self-direction  in  learning,  while  several  other articles  were  related  in  a  secondary  way.  Also,  during  the  1985  Adult Education Research Conference, over 11 percent of the paper sessions were on the topic of  self-direction.

Nonetheless, while we are encouraged by the picture presented in this and the  following  two  chapters,  we believe  that the  future  of  adult education research  in  general  depends  on  continuing  research  efforts.  To  this  end, self-direction  in learning  can serve as a "miner's canary," something  of a gauge for measuring the ability of adult education to develop,  sustain, and utilize a substantial knowledge base. Beder (1985) has suggested that while self-directed  learning  is one of the two relatively well developed  research areas  in  adult education,  it  is  doubtful  whether this knowledge  has  been utilized  to guide practice  in a major  way. While, as we have stated  above, research has often been used to improve  practice, Beder's point is well  taken, and should be kept in mind when implementing  self-directed learning in the future.

In trying to make sense of the research base on self-direction in learning, it may be helpful to classify the various types of studies  that have contributed to the development of this research base. Caffarella  and O'Donnell  (1988: 40) have offered  one such scheme. According to this view, research can be classified  along five  categories:

- 1 Nature  of the philosophical position -conceptual  perspectives  on the process of self-directed learning;
- 2 Verification studies descriptive investigations of adults learning  projects;
- 3 Nature  of  the method  of  self-directed learning questions  of "how" people plan and implement learning projects;
- 4 Nature  of  the  individual  learner  questions  of  who participates  in self-directed learning and for what purposes; and
- 5 Policy questions pertaining to the educator, institutions, and society.

This  classification  is  based  on  the content of  research  studies. Further, it emphasizes both empirical research "as well as serious conceptual  articles" (Caffarella and O'Donnell, 1988: 39).

An  alternative  classification  scheme  is  based  on  the  type  of  research paradigm under which an investigation falls. Several years ago, we presented a classification  scheme consisting  of three major categories  or "streams" of inquiry:  descriptive learning  projects  investigations,  research involving measurement of self-directed learning levels, and qualitative studies (Brockett et al., 1982).  In our view, this "three-streams"  model still serves as an

## 40 The underlying  knowledge base

appropriate classification scheme,  for  the  vast  majority  of  studies  on self-direction still fit within one of these categories.

The first  major branch of inquiry grew out of the methodology utilized initially by Tough in his work, The Adult's Learning Projects (1971, 1979). This line of research,  since replicated by numerous researchers  with a wide range of adult populations, provides convincing descriptive evidence of the frequency of self-planning by adult learners.

A second major branch of research has essentially defined  self-directedness as apersonological, or personality-related variable. In this approach, written instruments  are used  to determine the extent to which individuals possess qualities associated with self-directedness. This branch of inquiry has led to a number of studies linking self-directedness with such concepts as creativity (Torrance  and  Mourad,  1978),  self-concept  (Sabbaghian,  1980),  motivational orientation (Reynolds, 1986), life  satisfaction (Brockett,  1985a), and intellectual development (Shaw, 1987). Also, several researchers have used instruments designed to measure self-directedness in a diagnostic capacity within the classroom  setting (e.g., Caffarella,  1983b;  Kasworm,  1983;  Savoie, 1980; Six, 1987; Six and Hiemstra, 1989a). This branch of inquiry has been responsible  for moving our understanding  of self-direction in learning from basic description toward greater understanding of how such  variables may be related to one another and, to a lesser degree, where changes in one variable may cause a change in the other. Chapter 4 will highlight this branch of research.

A  third  approach  to  studying self-direction  in  learning  has employed qualitative methods such as observation and interviewing  in order to develop models that can help to explain the meanings and contexts of self-direction in learning during adulthood (e.g., Brookfield,  198Ib; Gibbons et al., 1980; Spear and Mocker,  1984), This branch of research (which will serve as the focus for Chapter 5) has helped adult educators in theory-building, which, in turn,  has  influenced the ways in  which researchers and practitioners now understand self-direction in adult learning.

It is important to bear in mind that while these three streams of research have evolved in a somewhat sequential manner, they are not distinct stages of research. In other words,  newer  methodologies  have not replaced previous approaches.  Rather, each stream of inquiry continues to serve an important role in addressing specific types of research questions relative to self-direction in adult learning. The remainder of this chapter will offer a closer look at the first major stream of research by focusing on selected studies that reflect the learning projects paradigm.

## LEARNING PROJECTS RESEARCH

## The work of Allen Tough

In 1965,  Allen Tough completed his doctoral  dissertation  at the  University of Chicago  on teaching  tasks performed by "adult  self-teachers." He found that, while self-teaching  implies a degree of independence  or autonomy, the learning that occurs through self-teaching  does not generally  take place in isolation (Tough,  1966), Those  individuals who engage in self-teaching  are highly  likely  to  seek  the  assistance  of  others,  such  as  close  friends  and relatives,  librarians,  subject-matter  experts,  and fellow  learners.

Tough,  in this  study, focused  on individuals engaged in a  self-teaching project.  As an outgrowth of this work, he began to raise questions  about the extent to which self-teaching is a part of the total range of an  individual's learning activities. Subsequently, during 1970, Tough and several colleagues at the Ontario  Institute  for Studies in Education  (Toronto)  interviewed  66 adults in an attempt to examine "the highly deliberate learning  efforts" of adults.  Particular  emphasis  was  placed  on  the  "planning and  deciding" aspects of the learning project.

Tough defined a learning project as "a series of related episodes, adding up  to  at  least  seven  hours"  where  "more  than  half  of  the  person's  total motivation  is to gain and retain certain fairly  clear knowledge  and skill,  or to  produce some other lasting change in himself' (Tough, 1971:7). Similarly, an episode was defined as "a period of time devoted to a cluster or sequence of  similar  or  related  activities, which  are  not  interrupted  much  by  other activities" (Tough,  1971; 7). Examples of episodes might include reading a newspaper or a chapter of a book, visiting a museum, or attending a class. An episode had a definite  beginning and concluding time,  and,  to  be classified as an episode, the information had to be retained for at least 2 days after the learning activity took place. This qualification excluded activities in which learning was intended to serve an immediate purpose,  such as being able to assemble  a piece  of household  furniture  -  an ability quickly  forgotten. A learning  project,  then, was considered  to be the total of all episodes  that a person had undertaken in order to gain (and retain) some specific  knowledge or skill.

Tough was very specific in stating that a learning project must encompass a minimum of seven hours. There were two major reasons  for setting  this seven hour minimum. First, this period of time is approximately equivalent to  a  traditional  working  day  (excluding breaks  and  "down  time"),  which Tough thought a considerable investment of time for a single learning project. Second,  seven hours  was  found  to  work well in interviews with  subjects because  it  eliminated very  brief  activities but  not  major  learning  efforts. Additionally,  this  seven  hours  must have  taken  place  within  a  six-month

## 42 The underlying  knowledge base

period. It is important to emphasize that the "seven hours within a six-month period" qualification was intended as a minimum expenditure  of  time.  In reality, Tough found that the majority of learning projects  uncovered  by his survey team far exceeded this minimum.

Thus, the 66 subjects were interviewed about their involvement in learning projects  over the previous year. These individuals were drawn from  the following seven sections of the population:

- 1  Blue-collar workers;
- 2  Women in lower-level white-collar positions;
- 3  Men in lower-level white-collar positions;
- 4  Beginning elementary school teachers;
- 5  Municipal politicians;
- 6  Social science professors; and
- 7  Upper-middle-class women with pre-school children.

To obtain data, a highly structured  interview process was employed.  Interviewers were trained in how to use the interview format and in how to identify learning projects. Thus, interviewees could uncover many different kinds of efforts  while eliminating "borderline learning," such as brief episodes and activities in which learning  was not  the major reason for undertaking  the effort.  While the interview procedure was generally structured, there  were certain  points in the process  where interviewers would share with subjects various "probe sheets" that  prompted a  recall of learning projects from a wide range of areas (e.g., child-rearing,  gardening, music,  collecting, and job-related knowledge and skills).

It  was  found  that the "typical"  adult had  been  involved  in  about  eight different  learning projects during the year prior to the interviews. The mean number of projects  was  8.3;  the  median was  8. Of  the  sixty-six persons interviewed, all but one reported having been involved in at least one learning project. The highest median  number  of projects were completed by the social science professors  (11.5)  and elementary school teachers  (9.0), while  blue collar  workers  and  municipal politicians had  the lowest  mean number of projects (5.5 and 7.0 projects, respectively). The mean number of hours spent on an individual learning project was 104 while the median was 81, a figure well above the minimum criterion set by Tough. Further, less than 1 percent of all learning projects were undertaken in order to gain credit. Why do adults make the choice to undertake deliberate learning projects? According to the individuals  interviewed in  the  Tough survey, the  major  reasons  included preparation for a  job and  maintenance of  job skills, solving a specific problem or task on the job, gaining knowledge and skill about some aspect  of one's personal  development or responsibilities within the home, and learning out of curiosity or interest in a topic or as a leisure pursuit. Tough stressed  that

most learning projects are  motivated  by  "some anticipated use or application" of what has been learned. This finding is quite consistent with other surveys of reasons for adult learning participation (e.g., Aslanian and Brickell,  1980; Cross,  1981;  Boshier and Collins,  1985).

Probably  the most important  finding  to emerge  from  Tough's study  certainly  with regard to our current discussion -  pertains to the question of who assumes  responsibility for  planning  learning  projects. By  far  the majority of projects identified in the Tough study (68 percent) were planned primarily by the individual  learners  themselves.  Another  12 percent  were planned by a group or its leader/instructor  (e.g., formal classes),  8 percent were planned primarily  by another person  in a one-to-one  situation  (e.g., tutorial), and anon-human resource (e.g., aprogrammed instruction manual) served as the planner in only 3 percent of the projects. In the remainder of projects, no single type of planner could be clearly identified.

It is this finding about individual planning preferences that lies at the heart of the current emphasis on self-direction research. While self-direction  has long been  assumed to be a major  goal of adult education, it was not until Tough's  investigation  that  the  impact  of  this  preference  for  individual responsibility  in  planning  was  made  apparent.  In  fact,  Tough  used  the analogy of an iceberg to describe adult learning. Only a very small portion of each  (i.e., an iceberg  and learning) is clearly visible, while the rest lies beneath the surface. The point here is that the vast majority  of what adults learn is not easily observed as through rates of participation in formal adult education programs.

More recently, Tough (1982) has expanded his focus from the notion of adults learning projects to the broader concept of intentional changes.  Here, Tough looked at the ways  people undertake major personal change in various aspects of their lives. Using a format similar  to the learning projects interview protocol  and via a team of interviewers, Tough found that 75 percent of the changes  reported  by  interviewees  fell  into  four  areas:  job,  career,  and training;  human  relationships,  emotions,  and  self-perception;  enjoyable activities; and changes in residence location. With regard to taking responsibility for intentional changes, Tough (1982: 52) observed that, on average, "the person assumes about 70 percent of the responsibility for all the subtasks involved in choosing  the change, planning the strategy, and implementing the change".

While  the  intentional  changes  approach  does  not  seem  to  have  been embraced  as  widely  as  the  learning  projects  paradigm  (e.g., Caffarella, 1983a; Sisco, 1983), there have been a few efforts to build on Tough's initial study. Moore (1986), for example, found that most of the prison inmates in his survey undertook several important changes in a year, with self-directed learning serving as an important foundational aspect of the change. Lundgren

## 44 The underlying knowledge  base

(1988) interviewed  46 Type II diabetics in Montana, and found that at least 85 percent had made at least one health-related change in the previous five years. Self-planned  learning projects were an important  part of the change process for many of the individuals interviewed by Lundgren, and reading was viewed as the primary learning activity. From these studies, it can be seen that while  the thrust of the intentional  changes  paradigm  is  different from  Tough's earlier  work,  the  link  to  self-planned  learning nonetheless remains.

With the publication of The Adults'  Learning Projects in 1971, numerous researchers began  to adopt the methodology used by Tough  in  conducting additional  studies  with  different  segments  of  the  adult population.  In  the following sections, we discuss several of these replication studies. Our intent in  these  sections  is to provide  a feel  for the diversity  and flavor that  have characterized the  follow-up work  to  Tough's  study.  In  reviewing  these replications, it should be noted that despite considerable variation in both the total number of learning projects and in the total percentage  of self-planned projects,  the  findings  from  the  original  Tough  investigation  are  largely substantiated.

## Mothers with pre-school children

Johnstone and Rivera (1965), in their study of participation in adult education,  found  that  mothers  with  young  children  had  especially  low rates of participation  in institutional adult education programs.  Of the seven  groups studied  by Tough,  mothers with children of pre-school age completed  the third  smallest  number  of  projects  during  the  study period.  In  one  of  the earliest learning projects replications, conducted by someone other than one of Tough's associates,  Coolican (1975) explored the total range of learning activities (institutional as well as non-institutional)  of a sample of 48 mothers in Syracuse, New York, whose oldest child had not yet entered school.

Data were obtained through the use of a two-part survey instrument. One part of the instrument was a questionnaire designed to obtain  demographic information  about the interviewee. The other instrument  was an  interview schedule adapted from the one used by Tough. All interviews were conducted by the researcher and took place in the subjects' homes. Each interview began with  the researcher  striving to  develop  a relaxed  tone.  After  rapport  was established, the structured interview began. On the average, interviews lasted 85 minutes.

Coolican found that the subjects in her sample had conducted an average of 5.8 projects per year with a mean length of 43 hours for each project.  It was found that 66 percent of these projects were self-planned, a figure very similar to  that of Tough.  Nearly half of the projects  were concerned  with

home and family issues. Other major areas of interest included hobbies and recreation  (18 percent)  and personal  development  (11 percent). With the demands of caring  for  small children and running  a household,  Coolican found that these women typically were only able to spend short amounts of time on subjects in which they were interested.

Several possible  limitations of the study identified by Coolican  serve to point out some of the potential constraints of the learning projects methodology. First, since the data were obtained from a rather homogeneous  sample, results cannot be generalized  to a more heterogeneous  population.  Second, there  may be limitations in using  the interview  approach,  especially  with regard  to the recollection of learning projects  that had taken place  several months prior to the interview. Third, because of an unwillingness of subjects to reveal certain kinds of information or an inability to verbalize  responses, there may be instances  where the responses  of subjects do not  accurately reflect their actual experience. Fourth, no attempts were made to verify  the accuracy  of interviewees'  statements. Fifth,  the sample was based  entirely on willing participants and, thus, there is a possibility that those  who chose to respond were more oriented to or interested in learning than those who did not participate in the study. These  limiting factors do not detract from  the importance of Coolican's findings. Rather, they serve to articulate some of the very real concerns  that need to be taken into account when interpreting the findings of studies using the learning projects methodology.

## Rural and urban adults

In  the  earliest  large-scale  study  comparing  the  learning projects  of adults within a particular geographical area, Peters and Gordon (1974) interviewed a total of 475 persons  residing in Knoxville, Tennessee  and a nearby rural county. At the outset, fifteen  interviewers received 9 hours of formal training and were involved in several days of related activities such as readings, role playing,  and  practice  interviews.  The  interviews consisted  of  the  basic structure developed by Tough and lasted an average of 1 hour.

The 475 persons who were interviewed for the study ranged in age from 18 to 90,  with  a mean age of 41; the  majority  (61 percent) were male; 54 percent reported having less than a high school  education;  17 percent  were high school graduates while the remaining 29 percent held either undergraduate or graduate degrees.

Peters and Gordon found that their subjects had conducted an average of 3.7 learning projects in the year prior to the study.  This figure was higher for the urban subjects (4.1 projects) than for the rural interviewees (3.1 projects). Half of the subjects reported four or more learning projects during the study period; however, nearly 12 percent conducted no projects during this time.

## 46 The underlying knowledge base

The number of projects  for females and single  people  was slightly  higher than for men and those who were married. Looking  at age groups, persons in the 35-39 age group conducted the largest number of projects (4.8) while those in the 55+ age group conducted the fewest projects (3.7). It is interesting to note the difference between urban and rural subjects in the older  group. While interviewees in the 55+ age group who lived in the city averaged 5.4 projects - somewhat higher than the  average for  the total sample - those  who lived in rural areas averaged only three projects.

Consistent with  the  findings  of  Tough  (1979) and  Cooiican  (1975), learning projects conducted by persons in the Peters and Gordon sample were overwhelmingly  self-planned.  In  fact,  of  these  projects  66  percent  were planned  by the individual learner. Unlike Tough's findings, however,  12.6 percent of the Peters and Gordon sample were enrolled in formal courses,  a finding  attributed by  the  authors to the  relatively high number  of  college graduates found within the sample. This figure is consistent  with data  from the National Center for Education Statistics, which found that, in 1981,12.8 percent  of all adults participated in an adult education course of some type (Kay,  1982).  Other  findings reported  by  Peters  and  Gordon  dealt  with utilization of resources, obstacles to participation, and content areas studied by learners in the sample. Resources most frequently used included books, magazines, tools and raw materials, and other individuals.  The obstacles most often perceived by learners were lack of time, money, motivation, or education, plus family conflicts. The content of the majority of projects focused on topics related to employment or recreational pursuits.

In a follow-up analysis of the Peters and Gordon data, Brasfield  (1974) focused  specifically  on  the  link  between  learning  projects  activity  and educational attainment. In this analysis,  Brasfield found that those adults  with more formal education reported a greater number of learning  projects  than those  with less formal education. However, she also found  that the highest proportion of self-planned projects were found among those with fewer years of formal education. While the figures for self-planning among those with high school diplomas, or those with high school diplomas and some  college experience but no college diploma, and those with  at least a  bachelor's degree were  72  percent  and 74 percent  respectively, the  self-planning  figure for those with  0-12 years of education was 86 percent. This is a major departure from previous and subsequent research supporting a link between self-direction and  educational  attainment.  We  believe  that  the  findings  lend  empirical support  to the idea, which will be stressed  further  in the next chapter, that self-direction  holds  much potential for  serving  learners  traditionally  considered to be "hard-to-reach."

## Older adults

For the most part, learning projects research has been based on general adult samples,  not focusing  upon  any specific  age group within the  population. Yet, in studies of formal adult education participation  (e.g., Kay  1982),  an almost  universally  consistent  finding  has  been  that participation declines drastically  among those  persons  age 55 and above.  However,  at least  four studies employing the learning projects methodology have painted a somewhat  more  optimistic  picture  of  the  older  adult  as  a  potential learning participant.

The first study in North America to focus on the learning projects of older adults was Hiemstra's 1975 study in Nebraska, He examined 256 adults, at least 55 years of age, selected randomly from the voter registration cards in two communities and 18 rural townships, and from the membership list of a Hispanic community center. The sample for this study was predominantly white (88.7 percent)  and middle-class blue or white collar  (87.8  percent). Slightly more than three-quarters of the subjects (75.4 percent) lived in their own homes,  and 63.3  percent  were married while 25.4  percent  were  widowed. In terms of previous education,  66.3 percent were at least high school graduates and nearly 20 percent had graduated from college. The mean age of the sample was 68.1 years of age (Hiemstra, 1975,1976a).

Using the learning projects interview schedule, seven trained  interviewers spent between 1 and 2 hours with each of the interviewees. Hiemstra found that of the 256 individuals interviewed, 214 or 83.5 percent  reported  conducting one or more learning projects in the previous year. An average of 325 hours per year was spent on a mean of 3.3 projects. And, as with other learning projects studies, it was also found  that the majority of projects (55 percent)  were  self-planned. The  primary planner  used  by  subjects  in  this study is shown in Table 3.1.

With regard  to various  sub-groupings, there were some  important differences. For example, a higher proportion of people 65 and older reported no  learning  projects  in  the  year  before  the  interview  than  did  younger

Table 3.1 Different types of primary planner in learning  projects

| Type  of primary p lanner              |     % |
|----------------------------------------|-------|
| A group or its leader/instructor       | 20.45 |

individuals. However,  there  were  no  significant  differences  across  age groups between  those  who participated  in more self-planned projects  and those participating  in fewer projects of this type. Finally, when asked to name the primary subject matter of their learning projects, there were no significant differences  among the two age groups (i.e., those over and ui)der age 65) in terms of preferences for self-fulfillment  subjects (Hiemstra, 1985b).

From this study, we believe there is evidence that older adults often are active learners  and that most  of this  activity  is reflected  through  the  selfplanned  learning projects in which such individuals are engaged. This study suggests that "educators must learn how to remove their institutional blinders and recognize all the self-directed, independent learning going on and needed outside  institutional  structures"  (Hiemstra,  1976b: 337).  Such  research on older  adults is important  in terms of understanding how to facilitate daily learning efforts  (Hiemstra,  1987c).

A second study using the learning projects approach with older  subjects was reported by Ralston (1981), who was interested in comparing  black and non-black  groups. Ralston interviewed 110 randomly selected  persons  age 65 or older in Champaign-Urbana, Illinois. Among the findings of this study, Ralston found that her interviewees conducted a mean of 2.45 projects. She noted that "respondents who were white, white-collar, and had higher educational  levels  were involved in  significantly  more  learning  projects  than other  subgroups"  (Ralston,  1981:  1237).  She did not  seek  to  identify  the primary planner  of projects, so it is not possible  to determine the extent to which these projects were self-planned.

Hassan (1982) studied self-directed learning among a sample of 77 adults residing in Ames, Iowa. Of this sample, more than 37 percent were over 55 years of age. The 29 people in this older age group conducted a mean of 9.7 projects per year, a figure that was not significantly different  from that of the 48 younger people. The Hassan study is discussed further in Chapter 4.

In  a  fourth  study  involving  older  adults, Estrin  (1986)  examined  the relationship between life satisfaction and learning participation among older women living in two subsidized senior housing developments in southern Rhode Island. Of the 87 women in this study, 54 were widowed, the mean age was 72.5, and the mean educational level was 10.3 years. Estrin found a significant positive relationship between life satisfaction and learning  activity, both in terms of number of projects and number of hours spent  engaged in learning. She concluded that participation in learning can be viewed as a strategy for enhancing life satisfaction in the later years. This conclusion  is further  supported through research (Brockett, 1985a) that will be addressed in the next chapter.

## A U.S. national sample

Probably  the most comprehensive  learning projects  study to date was  conducted by Penland (1977,1978,1979), For the most part, learning  projects studies have focused on self-planned activities within specific groups; thus, the findings have not been generalizable to a larger population. By obtaining data from a  U.S. national-probability sample, Penland attempted to overcome this limiting factor by conducting  a study that would address what he felt to be a "lack of a systematic behavioral foundation for a professional  helping relationship" (Penland,  1978: 1).

The study sample  was drawn from  the total U.S. population  of persons aged 18 or older, in a manner similar to the way in which public opinion polls are conducted. Since the study was conducted under different  circumstances than  other  learning  projects  studies,  the  interview  format  was  modified somewhat  from  the  structured  interview  schedule  developed  by  Tough (Penland,  1979).  The  instrument used by  Penland  was  developed  so  that interviews could be completed in 1  hour, and so those subjects not involved in learning could be accommodated "more efficiently" (Penland, 1978). For purposes  of  the  study,  Penland  defined  a  continuing  self-learner  as  "an individual (usually adult) who plans  and designs  an independent  learning project",  and independent self-designed learning was defined as "the  overt behavioral  evidence  of  a  sequence  of  information  processing  episodes" (Penland,  1978: 3).

The interview schedule used by Penland looked at three different  sets of questions. The first set sought information about the "patterns and purposes" of  adult  learning  activities.  These  questions  explored  the  frequency  and nature of learning projects. A second group of questions explored the use of resources  as a part  of the learning process.  In  addition, several  questions focused on obtaining demographic information about the subjects.

Penland found that 78.9 percent of the sample perceived themselves to be "continuing  learners"  and  that  76.1  percent  had  conducted  at  least  one self-planned  learning  project  in  the  year prior  to  the  study. The  average number of projects per person was 3.3 with a range of from 1 to 18. A mean of  155.8  hours was spent on each project. Penland  attributed much of this figure to the involvement of the learner in planning aspects of activities that might otherwise be assumed by someone or something else.

The three reasons cited by subjects for preferring self-planned  learning include the desire to learn what they choose and at their own pace, to maintain flexibility  in  their  learning  activities, and  to  structure  their  own  project. According to Penland, the widespread  emphasis on self-planned learning can be viewed as evidence  to support the centrality of individualism in United States society.

## 50 The underlying  knowledge base

An important component of the Penland survey was the use of resources, particularly the library, in conjunction with self-planned learning projects. It was found that 73.2 percent of those persons who considered themselves to be continuing learners had deliberately looked up some piece of information during the 7 days prior to the interview. However, only  14 percent of the sample stated that they used the library on a regular basis, while another 60 percent never used the library for self-planned learning. Penland concluded that those persons who participate in lifelong learning activities need "shopping center" access to resources. This, he feels, requires the cooperation of adult educators, information brokers, and community  development personnel. In Chapter 9, we suggest some policies related to this need.

## Low levels of self-planning

The studies described  above indicate a high degree of self-planning among learners from a  variety  of settings. Indeed, most learning  projects studies  have shown that a clear  majority  of projects  are  self-planned. However, some studies have found half or less of all projects to be planned primarily by the learners themselves.

Johnson (1973) interviewed forty adults in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, who had recently completed senior  high school examinations. This group conducted  an  average  of  14.4  learning  projects,  50  percent  of  which were self-planned.

Miller and Botsman (1975), using a modified case study approach, examined the learning projects of  nine Cooperative Extension agents in New York State. Subjects conducted an average of twelve projects; of these, 40 percent were self-planned, while more than half of the projects consisted of workshops planned by others.

Umoren (1978) studied 50 individuals from two socioeconomic groups in Lincoln, Nebraska. In this sample, the 38 low income adults and 22 middle or high income individuals conducted  an average of 4.7 learning projects, and about 40 percent of these projects were self-planned.

Field (1979) examined  the learning activities of 86  low-literacy attainment  adults in  the  Brownstown, Jamaica,  area.  Of  the  4.2  average number  of  projects  conducted  by  these  subjects,  about  20  percent  were self-planned and more than 50 percent were planned by group leaders. Field attributed  these  figures  to  a  prevalence  of  literacy  training  and  projects pertaining  to  religious  activities,  both  of  which  tended  to  rely  on  group leaders.

Baghi (1979) looked at the learning project activity of 46 participants in adult basic education classes and learning centers near Des Moines,  Iowa. These individuals reported an average of 6.6 projects per year, 57 percent of

which were self-planned. In this sample black respondents reported a higher mean number of learning  projects  and of hours  spent on learning  projects activity  than white interviewees,  although the differences were not statistically  significant.

While studies reporting low figures for self-planning  are a clear minority of  learning  projects  research,  they make an important  contribution  to this research  area in  at least  three  ways. First,  the findings  indicate  that  such groups are, indeed, much more actively involved in adult learning  activities than studies focusing on more "formal" participation  typically indicate. This has  clear  implications  for  how  educators  of  adults  might  work  to  reach traditionally  "hard-to-reach" groups  of  adults  (Brockett,  1983b).  Second, these studies accentuate  the need to use caution when espousing the value of self-planning  for all  adult learners.  This  concern  is related  to some  of the myths presented in Chapter 1.  Finally, these findings can serve as an impetus for encouraging a critical look at both the contributions and potential limitations of the learning projects methodology.

## Contributions and limitations of learning projects research

Has  the  learning  projects  methodology had  a  major  impact  on  efforts  to understand self-direction in  adult  learning? To  address this question,  it is necessary  to assess both the contributions and limitations of this  approach. Looking first at contributions, there are at least three ways in which learning projects  research  has  benefited  the  field  of  adult  education.  First,  it  has offered  a method for studying the learning efforts  of countless  individuals who prefer to engage in learning activities outside of the formal, educational institution setting. Because the methodology emphasizes learning that takes place both within and outside of institutions, it has provided away of studying learning among individuals, such as older adults and those persons with little or no formal education,  who have traditionally been  considered  "hard-toreach."

A second, related contribution is that the learning projects  methodology has served to redefine the meaning  of adult education participation (Brockett, 1983b). For the most part, surveys of participation in adult education, such as those conducted by the National  Center for Education Statistics (e.g.,  Kay, 1982)  are based only on involvement in adult education courses.  However, as the Tough study and subsequent replications indicate, courses  comprise only a very small portion of all adult learning activity. The learning projects approach  can provide  data that  are much more  inclusive -  and,  as such, representative of the actual nature of adult learning -  than data reported in most survey studies to date.

Still another contribution of learning projects research is that the approach

## 52 The underlying  knowledge  base

has  represented  the  first  effort  by  adult  education  researchers  to  study systematically  the concept of self-direction in learning. The learning  projects approach  seems  to have served  a "consciousness-raising" function for the adult  education  field,  providing  data  to  confirm  that  which  was  known intuitively for many years. If the extent to which the research  approach  has been replicated by other researchers can serve as testimonial, Tough's initial study  would have  to be considered  one  of  the most  significant  pieces of research in all of North American adult education.

It is clear that the contributions of the learning projects  methodology  are quite substantial.  At the same time, as with any other research  approach, the paradigm has certain  constraints  that define and delimit the ways in which learning  projects  data may be interpreted. Brookfield (198  la),  for example, has  reviewed  Tough's  research  and  identified  three  limitations  with  the approach.

First,  there  are limitations  in using the structured interview.  While  the structured  interview  format  has  the  advantage  that  it  can  be replicated, Brookfield (198 la:  115) points out that the methodology can "run the risk of forcing  the  researcher's notion  of  what  are  admissible  and appropriate substantive concerns" upon subjects without taking into consideration  what they believe  to be relevant. In other words, the interview questions  and the biases of the interviewer might prompt subjects to respond in a specific way.

Second,  most of the subjects in Tough's  1971 survey were highly educated. Using the popular notion that education begets education, it could be argued that, since self-planning was clearly the predominant mode of learning in this study, it is not surprising for these learners to express a preference for  this  mode.  Since then, however, several  studies have  investigated  the learning projects  conducted by adults of lower educational attainment  than those in Tough's sample and have often found high degrees of self-planning (e.g. Brockett, 1983b,  1985c). Yet, as noted earlier, in the studies where the figures for self-planning were low, the samples tended to have a large number of  "undereducated"  adults.  Thus, one  could  believe that a preference  for self-planned learning will tend to be higher among those who have completed more formal  schooling,  But the relationship between self-directedness and previous education is not entirely clear and might, in fact, be related to other factors.  In any case, this potential limitation is certainly a relevant  concern when assessing the impact of self-directed learning research, and is therefore addressed  further in Chapter 5.

Third,  one might question the appropriateness  of studying  self-planned learning. Brookfield summarized this argument by stating that:

extended investigations into the nature of noninstitutionalized adult learning, while interesting, are inappropriate in the current economic  climate.

## Establishing  the knowledge base 53

Instead of  studying  those  adults  who  choose  to  ignore  formal  adult education provision and to devise their own learning schemes,  we should be  concentrating  our  efforts  on  retaining  the  loyalty  and continuing participation  of existing  students  as well as working  to increase  overall student numbers.

(Brookfield,  1981a:  117).

However, Brookfield  is quick to negate this argument by stating  that if, in fact,  self-planning  is as prevalent as the learning  projects  research  suggests, adult  education  faces  the  challenge  of  identifying  ways  to  support such efforts.  It  is  this  emphasis  on  supporting  self-directed  learners  and  their efforts  that comprises the major focus of subsequent chapters in this book.

There are at least two other considerations  that we believe are  important when reviewing learning projects research.  These  have less to do with the methodology, per se, than with the way in which results could potentially  be misinterpreted.  When interpreting the results of learning projects  studies, it is important to bear in mind that, while  most researchers have used the Tough interview  schedule  as  a  point  of  departure,  there  is  often considerable variation  in the specific  questions asked, the actual interview process, and the  data  analysis  procedures.  For example, most  studies report  figures for self-planning  as a percentage  of the total projects conducted by all subjects in the sample.  However, Penland (1979) based  his finding relative  to selfplanning  on  the  percentage of  the  sample  who  completed at  least  one self-planned  project,  rather  than the total percentage  of projects  that  were planned by the learners themselves. This kind of variation is not a limitation in and of itself; however, those who utilize the findings need to be aware of these variations when interpreting data from these studies.

Another way in which learning projects data can be misinterpreted is that the  approach  is  sometimes described  as a qualitative research  method.  In reality, it is a quantitative descriptive survey approach.  While  interviewing is  frequently  associated  with  qualitative research,  it  is  the  way  in  which learning projects data are analyzed that places the method into a descriptive category.  Fingeret  (1982)  points out that qualitative data  are presented  as quotations that have been taken from  an interview or observation.  She states that data are not the numbers of responses  given to a particular question but, rather, are the actual words of the subjects themselves. In learning  projects studies data are treated primarily through descriptive  statistics.

Finally, Caffarella  and O'Dormell have raised  the concern  that  learning projects studies have "reached the point of dullness.*' They go on to offer the following suggestion;

We may need to put the element  of surprise into future verification studies. If we know the answer in advance, do we really need to ask the question?

## 54 The underlying  knowledge base

The greater the surprise or astonishment  with the findings  of our  selfdirected  learning  research,  the  greater  the  new  knowledge  about  the concept will be.

(Caffarellaand O'Donnell, 1988: 47)

The implication  here is that while learning projects research has been vital to our understanding of self-direction in adult learning, we have pretty much reached  a point of saturation with this approach.  The kinds of studies that will be reported in the next two chapters are indicative of a  healthy evolution in the development of research on self-direction in adult learning.

## CONCLUSION

In  summary, we believe  that the  learning  projects  approach  has  made  a landmark contribution to the adult education literature and has, both directly and indirectly, served as a major source of impetus for the development of a systematic body of knowledge in the area of self-directed adult learning. At the same time, we believe that it is important to interpret learning projects findings  with a degree of caution, and to recognize  that the approach  was designed to address \hefrequency and nature of learning projects activity, not to assess the quality  of or reasons for such activities. These kinds of issues have begun to be addressed through other methodologies and will be  explored in the next two chapters.

## 4 Measuring the iceberg: quantitative approaches to studying self-direction

In the previous chapter, we suggested that research on self-direction  in adult learning has followed three different,  though related, streams of inquiry. As was noted  in  Chapter  3,  the  first  stream  consists  of  descriptive  research studies using the learning projects methodology. While this line of inquiry laid a foundation for our present understanding of self-direction by illustrating the widespread emphasis on such learning efforts, it became clear during the  late  1970s and early  1980s that the "iceberg" concept, as outlined  by Tough (1979) was itself only the tip of an iceberg. Thus, researchers  began to search out new ways to gain a broader understanding of the  self-direction phenomenon that would stretch beyond merely describing the frequency and nature of such activities.

As a result, two additional streams of research have evolved: the quantitative measurement of self-direction through written instruments and the use of  qualitative methods such as observation  and interviewing. This chapter will  offer an  examination  of  efforts  to  expand  the  knowledge  base  of self-direction  by reviewing the first  of these research directions. The third stream of research will be considered in Chapter 5.

## QUANTITATIVE MEASURES OF SELF-DIRECTION

As was pointed out above, learning projects investigations provided greater understanding of the frequency  and nature of participation in self-directed learning by many segments of the adult population.  However, many questions remained unanswered. After  several years of extensive replication  of the Tough  methodology by various researchers,  it became clear that there was  a  need  for  research  that  would  go  beneath  the  surface  explored  by learning projects studies. For instance, little was known about personological variables, like self-concept and creativity, that might enhance  or limit the urge toward self-direction. Similarly, questions remained about the nature and extent  to which self-direction  can influence  the teaching-learning process

## 56 The underlying  knowledge base

in institutional settings. Thus, it was only possible  to make indirect links to self-direction through measures such as the Internal-External  Scale (Rotter, 1966),  a scale  designed  to  assess  one's  locus  of  control  (the  amount of personal control one perceives oneself to have), or the Personal Orientation Inventory (Shostrom, 1964,1974) (a scale that measures the extent to which one believes oneself to possess characteristics associated  with self-actualization) as conceptualized by  Maslow  (1970). An  exception was  the Autonomous Learner Index (ALI), a twenty-item self-administered Likert scale designed to measure attitudes toward dependence and independence in learning (Ferrell, 1978). However, this scale does  not seem to  have been used in research on self-direction beyond its initial reporting.

During  the  late  1970s,  it  became  clear  that,  in  order  to  advance  the knowledge base  of self-direction,  it would be necessary  to move beyond description  toward prediction  and  comparison  of  self-direction vis-b-vis other  characteristics. To  this  end,  Guglielmino  (1977)  developed  the Self-Directed Learning Readiness Scale. A few years later, the Oddi Continuing Learning Inventory was developed (Oddi, 1986). Together, these two instruments have played a major role in making  self-direction one of the most extensively  researched  areas  in  adult education during the  decade of  the 1980s.

## THE SELF-DIRECTED  LEARNING READINESS SCALE

One of the first efforts to move beyond Tough's learning projects methodology was the development of the Self-Directed  Learning  Readiness  Scale (SDLRS).  Developed  in  1977  by  Lucy  M.  Guglielmino,  for  a  doctoral dissertation at the University of Georgia, the SDLRS was designed to assess the  extent to which individuals perceive  themselves to possess skills and attitudes frequently associated  with self-directedness in learning. The instrument was designed through a three-round Delphi survey process involving 14 individuals  considered  to  be  experts  on  self-directed  learning.  Upon revision, the instrument was administered to 307 persons in Georgia,  Vermont, and Canada. From this administration, additional revisions were made and a reliability coefficient of 0.87 was estimated.

The SDLRS is a 58-item, 5-point Likert scale that yields a total score for self-directed  readiness.  In addition, a factor analysis of the instrument by Guglielmino (1977) identified the following eight factors:

- 1 Love of learning;
- 2  Self-concept as an effective,  independent learner,
- 3  Tolerance of risk, ambiguity, and complexity in learning;
- 4 Creativity;

- 5  View of learning as a lifelong, beneficial process;
- 6  Initiative in learning;
- 7  Self-understanding; and
- 8  Acceptance of responsibility  for one's own learning.

Although Guglielmino (1977) urged caution in utilizing this factor structure, it  is  nevertheless  possible  to  recognize from  these  factors  some  of  the attitudinal and personality factors that may be related to a tendency toward self-directedness.

At present, the SDLRS has been used in two major ways. First, it has been utilized  to explore  relationships  between self-directed  readiness  and other personological  variables  through  experimental,  quasi-experimental,  and correlational  research designs. Second, it has been used as a diagnostic tool for assessing learners' perceptions of readiness for self-directed learning. A steadily growing number of studies have employed the SDLRS  to date. In order to present a  review of these investigations, the remainder of this section will be broken down into the following subsections: early studies using the SDLRS,  studies examining psychosocial correlates  of self-directed  readiness, diagnostic studies, and investigations of self-directed readiness among a specific professional group (nurses). Finally, the section will conclude with an overall assessment/critique of the instrument.

## Early studies

The first study  to use the SDLRS with adults,  other than Guglielmino's initial investigation,  was reported  by Torrance and Mourad  (1978)  and provided support  for  the  construct  validity  of  the  instrument.  Forty-one  graduate students who were enrolled in a course on creative thinking completed the SDLRS and eight other instruments that produced eleven measures. Significant positive correlations were  found between  self-directed learning readiness  and  the  following:  three  measures  of  originality, the  ability  to develop  analogies  in  the description of photographs,  creative personality, creative achievements, and right hemisphere style of learning. A significant negative correlation  was found  between SDLRS scores and the left hemisphere style of learning. The authors thus concluded that a link exists between creativity and the tendency toward self-directedness.

An especially interesting finding of this study  was the positive relationship between  self-directed  readiness  and  right  hemisphere  style  of  learning. Among the functions of the right hemisphere of the brain are  "preferences for subjectively processing information,  dealing simultaneously with several problems at a time, grasping  at new and uncertain truths, intuitive problem solving, playfulness in solving problems,  using metaphors and analogies, and

## 58 The underlying knowledge base

improvising" (Torrance  and  Mourad,  1978;  1170).  Thus,  by  reporting  a relationship  between  the SDLRS  and several  learning-related  factors,  this study has contributed  to the way in which  self-directed  learning  might be defined. It should be noted, however, that a more recent study  (Blackwood, 1989) reported very different findings relative to the link between self-direction  and hemisphericity;  this study will be  discussed  later  in the chapter.

In another  study, Mourad  (1979)  examined  the validity  of the  SDLRS, comparing SDLRS scores with selected creativity measures, and considering grade  level  and  gender  differences  on  SDLRS  scores.  The  SDLRS  was administered  to 684 gifted  elementary, junior,  and senior high school students and to 185  members of the University of Georgia's School of Education faculty.  In  addition,  the  gifted students  completed  several  tasks  of  the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking  and 569 students were rated on their self-directedness by their teachers using a Teachers Rating Scale.

With regard to the professors, Mourad found that SDLRS scores were not significantly related to faculty rank, research production during a three-year period, nor to the number of citations over two years. When SDLRS scores were  compared  with those  of  gifted  students,  however,  a significant  difference  was found. Mourad  suggested that the SDLRS  thus  discriminates between these two samples. Among the gifted students, significant relationships were noted between teacher ratings and seven of the eight factor scores on  the  SDLRS;  also,  there  were  statistically  significant  differences  on SDLRS scores  among the three levels of students (elementary, junior, and senior high) and between males and females.

One  of  the  factors identified by  Guglielmino  as  a  component  of self-directed  readiness  is  self-concept  as  an effective  learner.  Sabbaghian (1980), therefore, took a closer look at the importance of self-concept relative to  self-directedness, She mailed copies  of the  SDLRS  and the  Tennessee Self-Concept  Scale (Fitts, 1965) to 80 randomly-selected adult undergraduate students at Iowa State University. A total of 77 individuals responded.

At least five major findings emerged from the Sabbaghian study and can be summarized as follows:

- 1  There was a significant positive correlation between self-directed  readiness and self-concept;
- 2  Self-concept  was found  to be related to all factors of the SDLRS except for "acceptance of responsibility for one's own learning;"
- 3  A positive relationship was found  to exist between self-image and selfdirected readiness;
- 4  Individuals  who had completed more years of formal education tended to  demonstrate higher self-directed  readiness and  scored significantly

higher on four of the eight factors (love of learning, creativity, initiative in learning, and self-understanding); and

- 5  Age and gender, by themselves,  were not significantly  related to either self-directed readiness nor self-concept; however,  the interactions between class rank were significantly related to SDLRS scores.

## Based on these findings, Sabbaghian was able to conclude the following:

There is a strong  positive  relationship  between the self-image  of adult students and their self-directedness in learning. As adults gain the ability to direct and organize their own learning, they consider themselves more and more as worthy persons in every aspect of life. Adult students with higher self-concepts  appear to be ... more likely to be able to plan and direct the majority of their learning projects themselves than  adult  students with lower  self-concepts.

(Sabbaghian, 1980: 114-15)

When examining self-directed learning readiness,  it is crucial to bear in mind that the SDLRS is a measure of the degree to which individuals  perceive themselves to possess skills and attitudes  associated  with self-directed learning.  It  is not a  measure  of  actual  behavior.  In  an  attempt  to  compare individuals'  perceptions of self-directedness  with their actual  participation in learning projects, Hassan (1982) studied  77 adults selected at random from the population of Ames, Iowa. Each subject was interviewed using the Tough interview format  and, at the close of the interview, was asked to complete the SDLRS.

Participants  reported  completing  a mean of 9.8 learning projects in the year prior to the interview, 78 percent of which were self-planned. Less than 11 percent of the projects were undertaken for credit. As for the relationship between SDLRS scores and learning projects involvement, Hassan  found significant  positive  correlations  between number of learning  projects  and scores  on  the  total  SDLRS,  and  seven  of  the  eight  factor  scores  of  the instrument. In other words, adults who were higher in self-directed readiness tended to be involved in a greater number of learning projects.

However, when Hassan  compared high, average, and low self-directed readiness with the various types of primary planner that were identified by participants,  she did not find a significant relationship.  Self-planning  was found to be the predominant approach to learning, regardless of the learners' degree of self-directed readiness. Individuals  who are higher in readiness for self-direction are likely to be involved in more learning projects than adults whose self-directed readiness is lower. However, highly self-directed learners are not significantly more likely to choose self-planning of their projects than those who are average or low in self-directed readiness. Still, this study

## 60 The underlying  knowledge base

is an important one in that it builds a link between the  descriptive-oriented learning  projects  approach  and the prediction-oriented  perspective  of  the SDLRS.

A more recent study (Hall-Johnsen, 1986) found further evidence for the link between self-directed readiness and actual learning involvement. Based on a sample of 65 professional staff from the Iowa State University Cooperative Extension  Service, it was found  that there was "a positive,  predictive relationship  between  readiness  and  the  number  of  self-planned  projects conducted, as well as the amount of time spent on them" (Hall-Johnsen,  1986: 2522A).

Skaggs (1981) was also interested in the relationship between  selfdirectedness and self-directed learning activity. The SDLRS and three other measures, including a biographical data form, a measure of locus of control, and  a  survey designed  to assess  self-directed  learning  involvement,  were administered to a sample of registered nurses in Texas. She found that there was a relationship between SDLRS scores and number of hours devoted by respondents  to  self-directed learning. In addition, Skaggs  found  selfdirectedness to be related to internal locus of control and negatively related to influence by powerful others such as supervisors. Based on her findings, Skaggs suggested that the SDLRS is an effective tool for identifying nurses with a tendency toward self-directedness in learning and, thus, can be useful in providing educational opportunities for registered nurses.

## Psychosocial  correlates

Into the early 1980s, the SDLRS was being used by an increasing number of researchers  as a way of linking  self-directed readiness  to a wide range of psychosocial  factors. The studies by Torrance and Mourad (1978), Mourad (1979),  and  Sabbaghian  (1980)  paved  the  way  for  this  research  focus. Numerous studies have followed over the years.

For  instance,  the  first  author of  this book  looked  at  the  link  between self-directedness  and perceived  life  satisfaction  among  a sample  of older adults from  a public housing building and an adult home (Brockett,  1983c, 1985a). Sixty-four persons, age 60 and older, were administered the SDLRS and the Salamon-Conte Life Satisfaction in the Elderly Scale (since renamed the  Life  Satisfaction in the Elderly Scale)  (Salamon  and Conte,  1981). A weak but statistically significant  positive relationship was found between the two variables,  suggesting that a relationship may exist between one's perception of self-directedness as a learner and such concepts as independence and  quality  of  life  during the  later  years.  In  addition,  however,  several concerns  were raised  about the appropriateness of the SDLRS for  certain

populations, particularly  those  with relatively  little formal education,  This issue is addressed in greater detail later in the chapter,

While the link between  self-directed  readiness and life satisfaction  was statistically  weak in the Brockett (1983c,  1985a)  study, further  support  for this link was provided  in a study by East  (1987). This  study was based  on 103 older adults drawn from  a retirement village in South Central  Florida. Results of this study lend further  support to the  self-directedness-lifesatisfaction link. Further, East noted that two SDLRS factors -  "acceptance of responsibility for one's own learning" and  "love of learning" were "mostly responsible for the effect  on life  satisfaction"  (East  1987:  2848A).

In  another  study  involving  older  adults,  Curry  (1983)  looked at  the self-directed readiness of 300 participants involved in formal adult education programs.  Using a descriptive-comparative ex post  facto design, she found significant  differences  in  SDLRS  scores  based  on  gender,  marital  status, educational background, and self-reported measures of intellectual functioning, learning  and  health,  self-help  groups  and  health,  and  current  life satisfaction.  In addition, when comparing  the SDLRS scores of this group with those of the sample on which Guglielmino's norms were based, Curry found  that the older  group "excelled" on  SDLRS  scores. Taken  together, these  studies  provide  reasonably  strong  support  for  a  link  between  life satisfaction and self-directedness among older adults.

Leeb examined the relationship  between self-directed  readiness and the tendency to practice a health-conducive  lifestyle. In a study involving thirtyfive  adults between the ages of 21 and 55, Leeb (1985: 159) found that  "the people who demonstrate positive health behaviors can be described as highly self-directed" Also, in this study, Leeb looked at the notion of cognitive and ethical  development  as proposed  by Perry  (1970).  According  to the  Perry scheme,  as individuals mature, they move from  thinking  about  knowledge and values in adualistic way (i.e., right/wrong, good/bad) toward affirmation that there are multiple views of reality based largely on the context through which  situations  are perceived.  As  an exploratory hypothesis,  then,  Leeb predicted that as individuals move away from dualist thinking, there would be  an  increase  in readiness  for  self-direction. While  this  finding  was  not confirmed,  she suggested that this potential linkage should  not  necessarily be abandoned, given the limited size of her sample and the exploratory nature of the hypothesis in this particular investigation.

Long and Agyekum (1983) employed a multitrait-multimethod approach in  order  to  test  thirty-seven  hypotheses  related  to  the  validation  of  the SDLRS. Using a sample of  136 college students, slightly less  than half of whom  were  black,  they  compared  SDLRS  scores  with  age,  educational achievement level, dogmatism, and agreement response  set (i.e., the extent to which subjects* responses  on a given scale  are determined by  personal

## 62 The underlying  knowledge base

beliefs and knowledge or by a tendency to respond  consistently  regardless of the content of various items). Also, they asked college instructors  to rate students on  "self-direction  in  learning  based  on  the  same characteristics Guglielmino identified in her original work" (Long and Agyekum, 1983:79). Among the findings of this study were the following:

- 1  Increasing age was significantly related to a higher SDLRS score;
- 2  Black  students scored  significantly higher  on  the  SDLRS  than white students;
- 3  Those  individuals who scored  higher on the SDLRS were significantly more  likely  to  receive lower  scores  on  dogmatism  and  agreement response  set;
- 4  Instructor ratings were not significantly related to scores on the SDLRS; and
- 5  Instructors rated white students significantly higher on self-directedness than black students.

The finding pertaining to race and SDLRS score would seem to be a most important  one,  given  the  notion  that  self-directed  learning  is frequently described as a middle-class, white  phenomenon. With regard to this finding, however, Long and Agyekum offer the following caution:

Any effort to explain differences in performance between two cultural or racial groups is fraught  with danger. Such explanations  are often interpreted  as  an  effort to  use  "race"  as  the  causal  factor  .... Important differences  that seem to favor  the black students seem to be  associated with the psychological  variables that are influenced by performance  on the dogmatism and agreement  response set instruments.

(Long and Agyekum, 1983: 85)

While the cautions raised here are certainly  in order, we believe  that the findings nevertheless offer  at least tentative empirical support for taking a closer look at the potential for self-directed learning among groups that  have traditionally been less involved in more formal forms of adult education.

Overall, Long and Agyekum concluded that there is, indeed, validation support  for the SDLRS.  However, concerns  about  apparent inconsistency between instructor ratings and SDLRS score prompted the authors to conduct a second study (Long and Agyekum,  1984). The second study  was essentially a replication of the earlier  investigation,  except that a different  teacher-rating instrument was utilized. For the most part, the findings supported those of the earlier study. With regard to teacher ratings, though, a different picture emerged. Though the correlation between SDLRS score and teacher rating of  self-directedness  fell  slightly  short  of  statistical  significance,  it  was considerably stronger than in the first  study, leading the authors to suggest

that the original teacher-rating  instrument may have been flawed, Of course, there is  a clear  concern in  attempting  to draw  conclusions from  nonsignificant  statistical analysis,  so this point can only be taken with a minimal level  of  credence.  Indeed,  Long  and  Agyekum  (1988)  caution  that  more cross-validation studies of the SDLRS must be conducted before a complete interpretation  of such findings is possible.

Intuitively,  one may find  it easy  to believe  that  there  is  a relationship between  learner self-directedness and the desire  to learn for the pure  enjoyment of and interest  in learning. Reynolds (1986), in a study of ninety-five part-time community college students, found support for such a link. Administering the SDLRS and the Education Participation  Scale (Boshier,  1971) to the  sample, Reynolds  found  a  significant  positive correlation between SDLRS score  and the motivational orientation factor "Cognitive Interest." At  the  same  time,  a  significant negative  correlation  was  found  between readiness for self-direction and the motivational  orientations of  "Professional Advancement" and "External Expectations." Based on these findings, Reynolds suggested that self-directed readiness may be associated with the desire to learn for the sake of learning, while those who are motivated by external factors, such as the desire for professional advancement and the  expectations of others, are likely to be lower in self-directedness.

McCarthy  (1986)  used  the  SDLRS  to  examine  relationships  between self-directedness and  attitude  toward  mathematics  among 183  younger undergraduate  students  (those  individuals  age  25  or  younger)  and  older students (those individuals 26 or older). While no significant relationship was found between self-directedness and attitude toward mathematics, the older group was found to be significantly higher on SDLRS scores.

It  was noted  earlier  that self-directed readiness  appears  to be  linked  to such factors as creativity, problem-solving  ability, and degree  of personal change  (Torrance  and  Mourad,  1978).  Guglielmino, et  al. (1987)  were interested  in whether or not a link exists between these characteristics  and actual  job performance. In this study, which was first reported in Guglielmino and  Guglielmino  (1983),  the researchers  administered  the  SDLRS  to 753 employees  (managers and non-managers) of a large utility company  who participated in training courses.  It was found  that those individuals rated as "outstanding performers" in  jobs requiring high levels of creativity, problemsolving ability, and/or degree of change scored significantly higher than the remainder  of  the  subjects  in  the  sample,  Further,  while  women  scored "slightly  higher"  than men, there were no significant differences between blacks and whites,  nor between managers and non-managers. Relative to age, it was found  that those persons in the 46-55 age group scored significantly lower than those of the other age groups. Finally, a positive relationship was

## 64 The underlying  knowledge base

found between SDLRS scores  and level of education. From their findings, the authors offered  the following recommendation:

In  light  of  this  study, personnel  departments  in  business  and  industry might consider  examining the use of a measure of self-directed  learning readiness  as part of the selection  process for individuals who fill highly creative jobs, highly  changing jobs,  and jobs requiring  a high  level of problem-solving  ability.

(Guglielmino, etal., 1987;  316)

A more recent  study by Roberts (1986) found  similar results with a sample of managers from the Hong Kong Telephone Company. Here, SDLRS scores were  found  to  relate  to  the  following:  management  level;  management performance; self-perceptions of creativity;  problem-solving ability; education level; and degree of change required in the job.

Most recently, the SDLRS has been used in several additional studies with various findings related to self-directed learning readiness and a wide range of variables. For instance, Young (1986) did not find a significant correlation between SDLRS score and locus of control. In another study, the "intuitive*' approach and "judging" orientation of the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator were found  to be related to self-directed readiness  among adult degree  students (Johnson, et a/.,  1988).  Self-directed readiness  was negatively  related to a preference for structure  in a  course setting,  but was  not related to achievement (Russell,  1989).  Among a sample of pregnant  women, Lacey found  that SDLRS scores peaked during the second trimester and declined through the third and fourth, "suggesting that this finding has implications for the timing of prenatal/postnatal classes" (Lacey, 1989: 2496A). There was no  significant correlation between  the SDLRS scores of a sample of fifth grade students and their teachers (Eisenman, 1989). Finally, Bitterman found a relationship between self-directed readiness and achieving style, a concept that "is based on motivation  theory and is rooted in the individual's reinforcement for goal accomplishment" within one's environment (Bitterman, 1989: 851  A).

## Diagnostic studies of self-directed readiness

The studies  described above have emphasized the use of the SDLRS as a tool for  basic  research,  designed primarily to explore the link between learner self-directedness and a wide range of psychosocial variables. In addition to this use, however, the SDLRS can be used as a diagnostic measure. The first three studies presented in this section offer  a look at self-directed readiness in a particular context: graduate courses in adult education where a learningcontracts  approach  is  utilized.  Caffarella (1982, 1983b) examined  the relationship between the value that learners ascribe to using a learning-plan

(contracting)  format  in a graduate-course  setting  and their perceptions  of self-directed  readiness.  Fifty-four  graduate  students  who had  enrolled  in courses offered by the researcher over a 2-year period, at the completion of their course, were mailed copies of the SDLRS and the Learning Plan Format Follow-Up Survey, a questionnaire  developed by Caffarella  to determine learners' "opinions related to the worth and value of the learning plan format, their perceptions  of their own self-directed learning skills,  and what if any effect  this  had  on  their  own  continuing  learning  and  teaching activities" (Caffarella,  1982:  48). Based on forty-two returned questionnaires,  it was found that 69 percent of the respondents believed the contracting format to be an excellent tool, while the remaining individuals felt it to be very good or good. With regard to SDLRS scores, the mean for this sample was at the 90th percentile based on norms established by Guglielmino (1977).  Caffarella  concluded  that  the  learning-plan  approach  is  a  useful  strategy  for promoting self-directed learning, and could be applied effectively in a wide range of adult learning situations.

In  a more extensive  follow-up study, Caffarella  and Caffarella  (1986) obtained data from 163 students from six universities. Using the SDLRS, the Learning Contract Follow-Up Survey, and the Self-Directed Learning Competencies Self-Appraisal Form, also developed by R. S. Caffarella,  support for  the  use  of  contract  learning  in  graduate  education  was  again  found. However, it was also found that the use of the learning contract did not have a  significant  effect  on  the  student's  self-directed  learning  readiness.  The investigators  speculated that  the  lack  of  a  significant  effect might  be attributed to very high pre-test scores on the SDLRS. Thus, while the study provides  support for the attractiveness  of the learning contract  approach, it does not establish a link between a preference for contracting and  one's level of self-directed readiness.

Kasworm (1982, 1983), in another study involving graduate students in adult education courses, examined the development of self-directed knowledge and behavior resulting  from  participation  in a graduate course  using learning contracts and where students were expected to assume a high level of  self-direction.  The  sample  was  comprised  of  thirty-three  individuals enrolled  in one  of  two  sections  of  a "Methods  and  Techniques  in Adult Education" course. Each individual was asked to complete the SDLRS at the outset  of  the  course  and  again  at  the  completion,  along  with  a  course evaluation form.  In  addition, the  instructor  and  two  students maintained "observational diaries" for the duration of the course.

A  t-test  analysis  for  the  pre-  and  post-test  SDLRS  scores  revealed  a significant increase  in scores over the duration of the course. In the course evaluation, most students expressed  positive  reactions  to the self-directed learning  approach  and  indicated  a  desire  for  further  self-directed  study

## 66 The underlying  knowledge base

opportunities; however, about one-quarter of the respondents stated that  they found the approach to be difficult  and would probably not opt for additional courses  using a self-directed  learning  approach.  Kasworm suggested  that some areas for further investigation to  better understand this dilemma include basic writing and oral communication skills, cognitive ability, and learning style preferences.

Another diagnostic study looked at a different  group of students. In this investigation, Cunningham (1989) studied the self-directed readiness among three populations  affiliated  with the Southern Baptist Seminary: new students; students  nearing graduation; and graduates with 2 years experience in the ministry. He reported a "significant increase" in readiness between the new and graduating students. However, it should be noted that this is not an increase, per se, but rather a difference since the comparison was based on two groups at one point in time rather than on one group at different  times. Also, Cunningham noted that 2 years of experience in the ministry "did not significantly  increase  readiness  for  self-directed  learning"  (Cunningham, 1989: 3246A). But again, the word "increase" seems to have been misused; instead, there were no significant differences between the practicing  ministers and the students.

Finally, a study by Rutland (1988) looked at the effects of a self-directed learning group activity on the self-directed  readiness  and self-concept  of Adult Basic Education (ABE) and General Educational Development (GED) students. Using a pre-test post-test design, with an experimental group that participated  in  10  1-hour  group  sessions,  Rutland  found  no  significant differences between experimental and  control groups on either variable. Like other  studies discussed  in  this  and  the  following  section,  these  findings contribute to mixed findings relative to the use of experimental treatments to increase  self-directedness among adult learners. Thus, while some of these studies indicate the potential  of the SDLRS as a diagnostic tool, it must be argued that the  jury is still out.

## Nurses and self-directed learning readiness

Self-directed learning readiness has been studied across a broad spectrum of adult groups. However, there is perhaps no other group that has been studied more extensively than  nurses. SDLRS studies involving nurses span different methodologies  (e.g.,  correlational,  experimental,  quasi-experimental)  and different  purposes  (e.g., studies of psychosocial factors related  to  self-directed readiness, diagnostic  investigations  of the concept).  Thus, we have chosen to present these studies within a separate  subsection.

The earliest investigation using the SDLRS with nurses was a diagnostic study conducted by Savoie (1980), who was interested in determining if it

would be possible to predict  success  in continuing  education  courses for nurses where learners were expected to assume a  high degree of self-direction. Savoie administered the SDLRS and a biographical information instrument to  152 nurses enrolled  in one of seven courses. A percentage  grade for the course (e.g. 79 percent, 94 percent) served to measure degree of success in the experience.

It  was  found  that  a  significant,  positive  relationship  existed  between SDLRS scores and course grades. Savoie also noted a relationship  between self-directed readiness and individuals  self-concept as self-directed learners; 1 a finding supported by several other studies (e.g., Sabbaghian, 1980; Brockett,  1983c,  1985a).  Savoie  concluded  that  the  SDLRS  can  be  useful  in determining the extent to which learners enrolled in activities requiring a  high degree of self-direction may need extra support or assistance  to succeed in the learning experience.

Box (1983)  investigated differences among first level students, second level students, and graduates of an associate degree nursing program. Based on data from 477 respondents,  Box did not  find  significant differences in SDLRS  score  among  the three  groups; however, she did note  a  positive significant  correlation  between SDLRS score  and grade-point  average. To some extent, this corroborates Savoie's (1980) finding.

Most SDLRS research to date has employed a correlational design, where comparisons are made between two or more variables without the administration of a specific treatment  or the use of control groups. However, a  study of  nursing students by  Wiley (1982a,  1982b)  was  an exception.  Using a nonequivalent, control-group design, Wiley examined the effects  of a 12hour,  "process-oriented",  self-directed learning  project  and  the  personal preference  for structure on  self-directed learning readiness.  A total of 104 junior nursing students, about 85 percent of whom were 20-21  years old, comprised the study sample.

Both the control and experimental groups were pretested on the SDLRS and Ginther's Reaction  to Statements (1974), a measure of preference for structure. The experimental group then participated in a 12-hour, self-directed learning process experience. Each group was posttested on the SDLRS upon completion  of  the  treatment.  After  analyzing the  data,  Wiley  drew  the following  conclusions:

- 1 Teaching the SDL process did not increase the overall SDL readiness of these baccalaureate nursing students;
- 2  Preference for structure did not affect  students* SDL readiness; and
- 3  Students  who  preferred  low  structure  and  who  experienced  an  SDL project gained in SDL readiness.

It  also  appeared, but was not conclusive, that students who preferred high

## 68 The underlying  knowledge base

structure and who experienced an SDL project lost in SDL readiness (Wiley, 1982a, 1982b). Based on these conclusions, Wiley suggests that a self-directed learning process experience  is useful for learners who prefer low structure. However, students who prefer high structure may benefit from "assistance in self-structuring" in addition to the self-directed learning process project.

Crook (1985)  was interested  in exploring  the predictive  validity  of the SDLRS. Like Savoie (1980), Crook wanted to determine the extent to which SDLRS score  could  predict  success  in the nursing  classroom.  Sixty-three first-year nursing  students completed the SDLRS and a demographic  questionnaire during their first week of classes. At the end of the academic year "students  were  asked  to nominate  the three  'most  effective* self-directed learners" in their seven- to eight-member study  group. Faculty members were also asked to do the same for their groups of students.

A  significant correlation  was  found  between  SDLRS  score  and  two variables: peer nomination scores and end of year grades. However, as was noted in another study (Brockett, 1985a, 1985b), these correlations explained only  a  small  percentage (7  percent  and  8  percent,  respectively) of  the variance.  Based  on  these  findings,  Crook  concluded  that,  although  the instrument has face validity and is easy to use, "for the purposes of predicting success  or  failure in  this  school,  the  SDLRS  has  not  been  found  useful" (Crook, 1985: 278).

Three additional diagnostic studies have recently been reported  (Moore, 1988; Murray, 1988; Palumbo, 1989). Moore looked at predictors of success in home-study nursing courses. In this study of  121 nurses,  SDLRS  scores did not correlate significantly  with final course grade. However, Moore notes that the nature of the sample, which involved both technical and professional nurses who were both highly self-directed  and highly motivated, and who answered most test items correctly, could have limited "possible correlation between the criterion and predictor variables"  (Moore,  1988:  1670A).

Murray used a quasi-experimental design to "investigate  the effect  of a clinical  internship on the self-directed  learning readiness  of  baccalaureate nursing  students"  (Murray,  1988: 1036-A).  It  was  found  that:  (a)  the experimental group (who participated in a clinical internship) differed  significantly between  pretest and posttest SDLRS scores; (b)SDLRS scores were related to grade-point average and plans for advanced education in nursing; and (c) SDLRS scores were significantly higher for those students who "felt they had a quality internship experience" (Murray, 1988:  1036A).

Like  Murray, Palumbo  (1990)  employed a  pretest  posttest  design  to measure change in SDLRS score over time.  Over aperiod of one and one-half years, this group of forty-five registered nurses studying for a baccalaureate degree showed a significant change in SDLRS score, but these scores were not  found  to  be  associated  with several  demographic variables.  Palumbo

concluded  that  the  change  in  self-directed  readiness  may  be  linked  with participation in formal education  and with the readiness  of these nurses to finish  their degree  programs.

Graeve  studied "registered  nurses' patterns of self-directed  learning  for professional  growth and development" (Graeve, 1987:820A). She found that nurses reported spending significantly more time: (a) in self-directed than in teacher-directed  learning;  and (b) in personal  than in professional  learning. A significant relationship  was found between SDLRS score and the number of hours engaged in self-directed learning, a finding that lends further support to the Hassan (1982) and Hall-Johnsen (1986) studies.

In an investigation  of self-directedness and  job satisfaction among nurses, Middlemiss (1988) used the SDLRS along with a measure of job characteristics, motivating potential of a  job, and  job satisfaction. Based on data from a sample of  115 randomly selected professional nurses, Middlemiss found that respondents perceived themselves to be high in self-directed readiness  and several job characteristics,  and that the interaction of self-directed readiness, job  characteristics,  and  motivating potential  of  the job  "predicted  29 percent  of  the variance  in job  satisfaction  for  professional  nurses"  (Middlemiss, 1988: 1036A).

From these studies, it can be seen that self-directed readiness is viewed as an important concept in the study of adult learning among nurses. And while the picture presented  by the results is somewhat mixed, this is essentially  a reflection of the overall body of knowledge relative to self-directed learning readiness,  Some possible  explanations for this mixed picture are presented in the next  section.

## Analysis of the SDLRS: methodological  and substantive issues

From the findings of studies such as those presented above, it should be clear that the Self-Directed Learning Readiness Scale has made a major contribution  to  the knowledge  base  of  self-direction  in  learning.  Yet,  as with any self-reporting paper and pencil instrument, it is unwise to accept the appropriateness of  the  scale  without  first looking  at  such  considerations as reliability and validity. In her original investigation of the SDLRS, Gugiielmino (1977) found areliability  coefficient of 0.87, which suggests that scores derived from  the instrument should be rather highly generalizable to populations similar to those in Guglielmino's study.  Further validation support for the  scale  has  been  reported  by Long  and Agyekum  (1983,  1984)  in  their multitrait-multifactor study,  Finestone (1984) in a construct validation study of the instrument, and Reynolds (1986)  and Long  (1987) through  item-tototal correlations for each of the fifty-eight  SDLRS items.

However, at the same time, Long and Agyekum {1983: 87) have stated

## 70 The underlying  knowledge base

that a further area for SDLRS research includes "validation studies based on intensive  experimenter  observation".  While  no  SDLRS  studies  based  on "intensive" observation have been reported in the literature to date, the first author of this book, in the investigation  of self-directed  learning  readiness and life satisfaction that was mentioned earlier, did have the opportunity to gain  some  insights from  observation  that led to additional  analysis  of the SDLRS (Brockett, 1983c,  1985b).

In the life satisfaction study,  each of the sixty-four  participants was given the  option  of  either  completing  instruments  on  their  own  or  having  the researcher  read each item and record the response. Throughout the process, it became  clear that many of the people in the study were having  difficulty and were becoming  frustrated as they completed  the SDLRS.  Since  more than 60 percent of the individuals chose the "oral" format, and since a t-test revealed  that there was not  a significant difference  in the scores  of  those persons  who completed the instrument in oral and written formats, "it was possible  to observe various points at which problems relative to the format and layout of the SDLRS appeared to arise" (Brockett,  1985b:  19).  These concerns led to the decision to take a closer look at the instrument.

Looking first at the reliability  of the instrument, a coefficient of 0.87 (the same figure reported by Guglielmino,  1977) was noted. However, as Nunnally has pointed out, reliability  does not necessarily  imply validity (i.e., the extent to which a scale measures what it was intended to measure). Therefore, a high level of "reliability is a necessary but not sufficient condition for high validity" (Nunnally, 1970:  107).

In order to look beyond reliability  toward  internal consistency  of the scale, an item analysis of the scale was conducted. Here, item-to-total correlations were obtained for each item of the instrument. It was found that 12 of the 58 SDLRS items (i.e., 21 percent of the instrument) did not correlate significantly with the total scale. Further, two related concerns seemed to emerge. First,  of these  12 items, 9 were among  17 items of the scale  written to be scored in reverse. Adding  to this  confusion is that many of the reverse-scoring items were written using double negatives. Second, many of the respondents were confused by the wording of the response choices of the SDLRS, which range from "Almost never true of me: I hardly ever feel this way" to "Almost always true of me: there are very few times when I don't feel this way".

The following comment addresses what we believed to be at least a partial explanation for these methodological  concerns.

It is suggested that the educational level of the sample can be associated, to  a  large  degree,  with  these  difficulties.  Previous  research  using  the SDLRS, primarily with subjects having at least a high school education, did not report these kinds of problems. One exception to this trend was a

## Quantitative approaches 71

study of rural adults of low formal educational attainment living in rural Vermont  (Leean  and  Sisco,  1981). This  study examined  the  learning efforts  of 93 adults through the learning projects  interview  format, the SDLRS, and case studies of a portion of the larger sample, In a personal communication,  Sisco  ...  stated  that  similar  kinds  of  difficulties were encountered in using the SDLRS as have been noted above. He concurred that many of the subjects found  the reverse-scoring  items and response choices frustrating. Based on the somewhat tentative observations of these two investigations,  it is speculated that potential concerns are accentuated when the instrument is administered to adults of low formal educational attainment

(Brockett, 1985b: 20).

While we believe that educational attainment might be a key link in terms of internal consistency of the SDLRS with this particular sample, it is important to note that Finestone  (1984), in his content validation of the SDLRS based on  labor  education  participants,  did  not  find significant  differences  on SDLRS scores according to one's level of formal educational attainment. At the same time,  Leeb(1985), inher study of health promoting behavior among a sample comprised largely of college graduates, found that eleven items of the SDLRS did not correlate significantly with scores on the total scale and, further,  that eight of the  11 items were among those questioned in the  life satisfaction study.

Landers (1990) undertook a comparison between the SDLRS and the Oddi Continuing Learning  Inventory (OCLI). He administered both instruments and  a  demographic  form  to  ninety-eight  graduate  students  at  Syracuse University. Findings relative to the comparison will  be discussed later in this chapter. In terms of the SDLRS, though, Landers found that each of the eight factors  correlated  significantly with total SDLRS score.  Further, he noted that only six of the SDLRS items were found to be weak statistically. It was concluded that in spite of identified  concerns  with the scale, internal reliability  was very high; thus, the  SDLRS is the most appropriate  of the  two instruments to use to measure self-direction in adult learning. The OCLI is discussed further in the next section.

Although methodological concerns with  the SDLRS raise some important questions about the appropriateness of the scale for certain adult  populations, there seems to be an even greater  issue at hand. It is suggested that the SDLRS defines  self-directed  learning  readiness  in  a  way  that  is  highly  oriented toward formal education and the learning of knowledge as opposed to skills, largely through  books. The issues might  be summarized  in the following way:

Self-directed readiness, as defined by the SDLRS, is very much oriented toward learning through books and schooling. Perhaps this is where the

## 72 The underlying  knowledge base

present  findings depart from the majority of previous  SDLRS  research, since earlier studies have generally reported  samples of college students and adults with at least  a high school education.  For these  groups,  the SDLRS has been demonstrated to be an appropriate  instrument. But how relevant  can  the  scale  be to  those  adults  who have  spent  little  time  in school?

One can argue that the SDLRS is appropriate for adults in general, citing the extensive body of literature of participation  in continuing  education and learning projects demonstrating that those  adults with more formal education  will  be  more  inclined  toward  formal  continuing  education participation, overall  learning  projects  activity,  and  positive  attitudes toward learning.  Indeed, there is something  to be said  for the notion  of "education begets education." But such a strong emphasis on books and schooling tends to minimize  the impact  of skills and attitudes  where books are,  at best,  supplemental tools  and may, in fact,  even be  unnecessary. Auto mechanics, musicians, athletes, and artists are but a few of the kinds of individuals for whom the most meaningful learning comes not from  a book, but from the actual experience of "doing". By using a definition of self-directed  learning that is as school-  or book-oriented  as the SDLRS, and expecting it to be relevant to all adults, there is a risk of excluding individuals from many walks of life, such as those mentioned [in Chapters One and Two], who may excel at taking charge of their learning, but have generally done so in nonschool settings, with  primary emphasis on resources other than books.

(Brockett, 1985b:  21-2)

Two additional studies have attempted to provide an even closer look at the appropriateness of the SDLRS, and offer very different conclusions. In a further  look  at  the  internal  consistency  issue,  Long  (1987)  conducted  an item-to-total  analysis  of  the  SDLRS  based  on  a  sample  of  117  college students "similar to Guglielmino's original sample, except that the subjects may have been slightly older and had a higher education level" than those in the earlier investigation (Long, 1987: 333). Long's major findings were that: (a) 3 of the 58 items did not correlate with the total instrument and (b) 12 of the 58 items correlated significantly with age. Based on these findings, Long argues that the findings from  the Brockett (1985a,  1985b)  study "are  more sample-related  than scale-related", meaning that the problems  encountered in  the  earlier  study may be  due more  to the nature of the  sample  than  to limitations of the  instrument.

Long's study makes an  important contribution, for - as  we  recommend in Chapter 13 - there is a  need for replication studies that can  lead to  refinement of the methodologies used to study self-direction in learning. Although we

are not in complete agreement  with Long's conclusion, since the emphasis of his study was on age -rather than educational attainment, which was at the heart of the concerns raised in the Brockett (1985a, 1985b) study - we still  believe,  however,  that  Long  has  made  a useful  contribution, and we welcome further validation  work of this type.

Finally, perhaps  the most direct criticism  levelled  against  the SDLRS  has been presented by Field (1989).  In this study, Field examined  structure, validity, and reliability of the SDLRS by administering the instrument to 244 individuals  enrolled as  students  at  the  Institute  of  Technical  and  Adult Teacher Education in Sydney, Australia, A reliability coefficient of 0.89 was found, which is very close to figures  reported previously (Guglielmino,  1977; Brockett,  1985b). However, item-to-total  correlations  revealed  that twelve items did not  achieve  a 0,3 correlation  coefficient  with the total  SDLRS. Interestingly,  three  of the items that did not correlate  have been  identified similarly in at least three other studies (Brockett, 1985b;  Leeb,  1985;  Long, 1987), and two additional items were found not to correlate with total SDLRS score  in both  the Brockett  and Leeb  investigations.  Thus,  at this time, the evidence is rather convincing  that early concerns  raised about certain items of the scale are warranted.

Field raises a number of other concerns  relative to the SDLRS,  Specifically, these concerns  center on four areas: (a) the use of the Delphi technique to generate  items, given conceptual confusion relative to the term  "selfdirected learning;" (b) lack of definitions for the terms "self-directed  learner" and  "readiness;"  (c)  the  use  of  negatively  phrased  items;  and  (d)  the instrument-development process used by Guglielmino, where 9 of 41 original items had been  eliminated  and 26 new items were added, without  separate validation  efforts,  to  give  the  scale  its  current  58  items.  Based  on  these concerns,  Field offered  the following  conclusion:

These  findings  suggest  that  the  use  of  the  SDLRS  as  an  indicator  of readiness for self-directed learning is not justified. As has been revealed, most of the claims regarding the scale rest on Guglielmino's developmental work which is seriously flawed, both methodologically and conceptually  .... This tentative interpretation does not imply any support whatsoever for continued use of the SDLRS. The problems inherent in the scale are so substantial that it should not continue to be used.

(Field, 1989:  138)

Field's  study  prompted  a series  of  responses.  Guglielmino  (1989)  responded  to the four criticisms  mentioned by Field. First, she stated  that the Delphi process was not used for the selection  of items, but rather, in order to obtain  a consensus  about characteristics  of the self-directed  learner.  Second, Guglielmino points out that "self-directed  learner" was defined through the

## 74 The underlying  knowledge base

responses of the Delphi  panel,  and clarifies  that "readiness" implies  that self-direction  can be viewed as a continuum  and with learners  existing at various points along the continuum. Third, Guglielmino justifies the use of "reverse items"  as a way of minimizing the potential  for "response  set", where a  person who  responds similarly to several items  of a  measure "is likely to assume that the remaining responses will be similar and cease to read the items carefully" (Guglielmino,  1989:237). Here she reports that, in another study - based on  a  sample of  3,151  individuals  - only  one of  the  reverse items had item-test correlations  of 0.30 or higher. Fourth, Guglielmino points out that the "17 additional items were added after the initial field test, not  * after validation of the scale,' as stated by Field"  (Guglielmino, 1989:238). Finally, Guglielmino presents  evidence intended to refute  concerns raised  by Field relative to the validity of the scale  and concludes  that Field's report "is so filled  with errors of omission  and commission that it does not merit serious consideration"  (Guglielmino, 1989: 240).

Long  (1989)  and McCune  (1989b)  offer  further  reactions  to the Field study. Long (1989) states  that Field's review of literature omitted  several important  references  and  provided  references  to  other  studies  that were "lifted out of context" or were "particularly  misleading" (Long, 1989:  241). He also adds further support to the comments by Guglielmino  (1989) relative to  the  validity  of  the  SDLRS.  McCune  (1989b)  takes issue  with  Field's statistical analysis.  Among the concerns  raised are Field's  use of a "modified" version of the SDLRS rather than the standard version of the scale and his discussions of reliability, factor analysis, and reverse-scored items.

Clearly, the SDLRS has proven to be a source of controversy  within the realm  of  research  on  self-direction  in  adult  learning.  Concerns  with  the instrument have led various writers to make recommendations ranging from proceeding with caution and ensuring that the scale is validated for different samples (Brockett, 1985b) to total dismissal of the instrument (Field,  1989). This controversy was perhaps  further escalated  in that, as recently as  1988, Guglielmino had not acknowledged  or addressed concerns  raised with the scale  (e.g.  Guglielmino  and Guglielmino,  1988). Recently, however,  Guglielmino pointed  out that in response  to earlier  concerns  (e.g.,  Brockett, 1985b; Brookfield, 1984c), she has developed a new version of the SDLRS for  adults with lower reading and/or English proficiency levels. This is an encouraging development that may address some of the concerns raised with the original scale.

In  summary, we believe  that despite  several  apparent  substantive  and methodological concerns, the SDLRS has made a most important contribution to present understanding of the self-directed  learning phenomenon by generating considerable research,  controversy, and dialogue. We think that this contribution ultimately outweighs  the limitations that seem to  be inherent

within the instrument.  Indeed, the SDLRS has made it possible to advance the knowledge base of self-direction in ways that otherwise probably would not have been possible. Guglielmino is to be commended for her willingness to help us become better able to explain what lies beneath the surface of the adult learning iceberg. At the same time, we believe that the criticisms raised about  the scale  cannot  be overlooked.  There  remain too many  questions, particularly relative to the validity of the scale, that are not easily dismissed. We are unwilling to dismiss the scale,  as Field has suggested, for to do so would  mean to ignore  such  findings  as those  presented  by Long  (1987). However, we do recommend that the SDLRS be used with the same discretion as any other standardized instrument. And, as we point out in Chapter 13, we would hope that future adult education researchers would join in the search for new and improved ways of measuring the iceberg.

## THE ODDI CONTINUING LEARNING INVENTORY

The  Self-Directed  Learning  Readiness Scale  has  played  a  major  role  in making it possible to quantitatively  measure self-reports of learners' tendencies toward self-direction. While there are certain limitations in attempting to quantify a construct that is linked to personality dimensions, the approach can  nevertheless  help  us  to  gain  understanding  that  is  not  likely  to  be otherwise obtained. Yet these instruments are limited by the way in which they define the meaning of a construct, such as is the case with the SDLRS relative  to  those  learners  who  are  not  oriented  toward  books  or  formal learning.

As away of providing an alternative measure of self-direction in learning, Oddi  (1984,  1985)  developed  the  Oddi  Continuing  Learning  Inventory (OCLI). Using a theoretical framework based on "personality  characteristics of  individuals whose  learning behavior  is characterized  by  initiative and persistence  in learning over time through a variety of modes"  (1985: 98), Oddi identified three clusters  that  she  hypothesized  to  be essential  personality dimensions of self-directed continuing learners. These dimensions include:

- 1 Proactive Drive versus Reactive Drive -  ability to initiate and  persist in learning without immediate or obvious external reinforcement"  (1985: 98);
- 2 Cognitive Openness versus Defensiveness "openness to new ideas and activities,  ability  to  adapt  to  change,  and  tolerance  of  ambiguity"  as opposed  to  "rigidity,  fear  of  failure,  and  avoidance  of  new  ideas  and activities" (1985: 99); and
- 3 Commitment to  Learning versus  Apathy or  Aversion to  Learning while many individuals enjoy learning for its own sake, there are also individ-

## 76 The underlying knowledge base

uals who have little interest in learning involvement. Those who fit the personality dimension of self-directed continuing learners generally  fall into the former category.

Based on these theoretical  dimensions, Oddi constructed  100 items that were subjected  to a content  validation by panels  of graduate  students and experts in psychological  constructs or self-directed learning. The 65 remaining items were organized into a seven-point  Likert scale and, in this pre-pilot form, were administered  to 30 volunteers. Emerging from  this preliminary scale  was a 31-item instrument, which was administered  to 287  graduate students  in  law, nursing,  and  education.  Five  items  from  this  instrument proved  unreliable;  however,  the  26 remaining  items  yielded  a raw  score coefficient  alpha of 0.75.

In order to obtain validation support for the OCLI, Oddi then identified a new sample of 271 graduate students in adult education,  law, and  nursing. Each person in this sample was asked to complete the OCLI and one of four instruments  selected  in  order  to  estimate  external  validity  for  the  scale. Included  in  this  validation  were  the  following instruments:  the  Leisure Activity Scale (Litchfield, 1965), a measure of adult participation in educational activities; the Internal-External Scale (Rotter, 1966), which measures perceived locus of control;  four scales  of the Adjective Check  List (Gough and Heilburn,  1983), designed as a self-report of selected personality  characteristics; and  the  Shipley  Institute of  Living  Scale  (Shipley,  1982),  a measure of adult intelligence.

It was found that the mean score on the OCLI for the sample was 123.6, with a standard deviation slightly  above 19  and a median of 126. A significant degree of skewness suggests that a fairly high number of the respondents in the sample could be described as "self-directed  continuing learners." Gender and  age  correlated  significantly  with  the  scale,  while  educational level, family income level, and parent's educational level did not correlate significantly. Furthermore,  while two of the items did not correlate  significantly with the total scale, the remaining 24 items demonstrated an internal consistency of 0.875 and a test-retest reliability  of 0.893.

A factor analysis of the instrument revealed the presence  of three factors. The first  of these  is essentially the notion  of a proactive  approach  toward learning,  which was  identified  in  the  theoretical  formulation used  in  the study, along with "the ability to work independently and to learn through involvement with others" (Oddi, 1986:  103). A second  factor was labelled "Ability to be Self-Regulating," and a third factor was called "Avidity for Reading." Since these factors only accounted for 30.9 percent, 8 percent, and 6.8 percent of the variance, respectively, Oddi suggests that the factors are not likely to be as useful  as the total score on the instrument. However, we

would note that accounting  for nearly 50 percent  of the variance  with any instrument is somewhat remarkable, given the many intervening  variables that are typically at work in human behavior,

With regard to  validity, Oddi reported positive correlations between OCLI scores and scores on the Leisure Activity Survey, as well as three of the four subscales on the Adjective Check List. On the other hand, the scale did not correlate  with scores on the locus-of-control measure and a subscale of the Adjective  Check  List dealing with open-mindedness  and flexibility. From the  validity-related  findings,  Oddi  suggests  that  the  scale  demonstrates convergent validity, and supports the elements of proactive drive and commitment to learning as elements of self-directedness in learning.

A particularly  encouraging  finding  is  that  the  OCLI  did  not  correlate significantly  with scores  on the Shipley adult intelligence  measure.  When combined with  the lack of significance between  OCLI scores and educational level, it would appear that the scale does not demonstrate bias toward those persons who  possess ahigh level of intelligence or a strong orientation toward formal  learning.  Given  the concerns  that have been  raised  relative  to the SDLRS, this finding could potentially prove important in using the  OCLI with adults of low formal education, as well as with populations  involving individuals with average or lower levels of intelligence.

Based on her findings, Oddi concluded that when used in its entirety, the scale demonstrates a satisfactory level of reliability and validity. However, she warns that the scale should be "used with caution until further studies are undertaken"  (Oddi,  1984:  174).  We  agree  with this  assessment,  for  to  do otherwise would run the risk of promoting the same kind of controversy that has surrounded the use of the SDLRS.

While the OCLI has been used in relatively few studies to date, compared with  the  SDLRS,  it  is  noteworthy  that  two  of  these  investigations  have offered  findings that differ from those of earlier investigations. Shaw (1987), for example, examined the relationship between self-directedness and intellectual  development.  She  administered  the  OCLI  and  the  Measure  of Epistemological  Reflection  (MER)  (Taylor  and Porterfield, 1983)  a measure  of  intellectual development, based  on  the  Perry  (1970)  scheme, which utilizes a short-answer essay format -  to a randomly selected sample of  100 students at Montana State University. Shaw reported  a statistically significant correlation between OCLI and MER scores, which suggests that as self-directed  readiness increases, intellectual  development also increases. In addition, Shaw noted  significant positive correlations  between age and scores on both the OCLI and the MER; however, she found that there were no  significant  differences in  scores  for  either  instrument  between  those individuals under age 25 and those 25 or older. Finally, she noted a positive

## 78 The underlying  knowledge base

relationship between class rank (freshman through post-baccalaureate)  and both the OCLI and MER.

Shaw's findings  are interesting in that they contrast with those  of Leeb (1985), who did not find a significant  relationship between self-direction and intellectual development. One possible reason for these differences in findings,  according  to  Shaw,  is  that  Leeb's  study  was  based  on  a  different methodology, as well as a smaller sample (N = 34), the vast majority of whom had completed  at least four years of college  at the time of the study. Shaw concluded  that  her  findings  offer  tentative  support  to  earlier  theoretical speculation by Kasworm (1983) and Cameron  (1984).

Blackwood (1989)  looked  at the relationship  between  self-directedness and  hemisphericity.  In  this  study,  hemisphericity  was  measured  by  the Refined Wagner Preference Inventory (WAPIII) (Wagner and Wells, 1985), a twelve-item, forced-choice inventory that views hemisphericity  on a continuum rather than as an absolute dichotomy. The WAPI II, the OCLI, and a demographic questionnaire were administered to 390 individuals who were "currently involved in a learning situation, and whose ages ranged across the life span" (Blackwood, 1989: 69).

A significant positive relationship was found  between  self-directedness and left brain hemisphericity. In addition, increasing age was again found to be related to greater self-directedness, as well as left-hemisphere  orientation. With regard to the differences  between the findings of this  study and the earlier  investigation  of Torrance  and Mourad  (1978),  where  self-directed readiness was found to be related to right hemisphere dominance, Blackwood suggests  that  there  may be two explanations:  (a) the earlier  study used  a measure that divided hemisphericity into three categories (right hemisphere dominant, left hemisphere dominant, and integrated) while the more recent study used a measure that views hemisphericity as a point along a continuum rather than as a dichotomy; and (b) since the small sample of the Torrance and Mourad study (N = 41) were all enrolled in a  university course on creative thinking,  they  may  have  been  influenced  in  the  direction  of  this  right hemisphere-oriented characteristic (i.e., creativity). Also, it should be noted that Blackwood used a different  instrument from  the Torrance and Mourad study, and this could have contributed to some of the differences in findings.

Our own view is that hemisphericity is one of those nebulous  concepts that does not offer  a clear and simple picture. It would seem that there are certain characteristics  associated with both hemisphere orientations that have been variously linked to self-directedness.  And it is here that the value of doing replication studies  becomes clear. Were it not for the later study,  earlier findings would probably remain unquestioned. Thus, while we are enthusiastic  about studies that find ways to make technical refinements on earlier

work, we suggest that hemisphericity may be one of those areas where there could be a risk of "mixing apples and oranges."

Another  study employing  the OCLI  offered  a look at  self-directedness among  clinical  laboratory  science  professionals (McCoy,  1988),  In  this investigation,  McCoy sought to determine "if a professional's environment had an influence on self-directedness in learning and participation  in  continuing education activities" (McCoy, 1988:187A). It was found that the OCLI scores  of respondents  were generally high and, further,  that  organizational environments with varying degrees of perceived mandatory continuing education did not appear to influence scores on the OCLI.

Since the OCLI is a  relatively new instrument, it  has  not yet  been subjected to the same degree of scrutiny as the SDLRS.  However, three studies have investigated methodological and substantive issues relative to the  instrument. Six  (1989a)  administered  the  OCLI  to  328  students  at  a  private,  2-year business college with a mean age of 19.6 years. Several weeks after completing the OCLI, 36 of the participants were selected at random to be assessed by their instructor on their level of self-directedness. Instructors were asked to complete a form designed by the researcher, the Classroom Learning Scale (CLS). A test of the relationship between scores on the OCLI and the CLS indicated a criterion-referenced validity coefficient  of 0.14 (p = 0.41). Six concluded  that  the  OCLI  was  not  an  effective  predictor  of  self-directed learning behavior in the classroom setting and that the OCLI was  not sensitive to demographic  characteristics of the  respondents.

In a follow-up investigation, Six (1989b) took a closer look at the three factors of the OCLI, as identified by Oddi (1984). Using data from his earlier study (Six, 1989a), along with data from the Oddi (1984) and Landers (1990) investigations, he sought to determine the extent to which the three factors "replicate across study samples" (Six,1989b: 44). Six found that the factors derived from his earlier data matched the factors identified earlier by Oddi, thus suggesting that "the factors derived by Oddi do not break up to form new factors under different  study conditions" (Six, 1989b: 50). These  findings therefore support the earlier factor analysis of Oddi (1984).

In conclusion, Six (1989b) offers  the following comment relative to the OCLI:

the  underlying  dimensions  of  the  OCLI  demonstrate  robustness  and applicability to a wider range of populations. One weakness, however, is that  the  total  explained variance  is bothersomely  modest, justifying  to some extent a lack of confidence to what is being measured. It is recommended  that efforts  be  initiated on  a number of  fronts  to  improve the measuring properties of the OCLI and of self-directedness in learning.

(Six, 1989b: 51)

## 80 The underlying  knowledge base

The third OCLI validation study was the comparison of the SDLRS and the OCLI by Landers (1990), which was mentioned earlier. Relative to the OCLI, Landers found  a significant positive correlation between two of the three factors and total OCLI score. He also found evidence that the internal reliability of the scale was weak: three items correlated negatively with total OCLI score and two other items were statistically weak. As was mentioned earlier, Landers concluded that, in measuring the concept of self-directedness, the SDLRS is preferred over the OCLI.

The findings of the Six (1989a) and Landers (1990) studies raise formidable  questions  about  the  appropriateness  of  the  OCLI  as  a  measure  of self-direction.  Yet,  as  with the  SDLRS,  we  are unwilling  to  dismiss  the instrument. Oddi has made an important contribution to the knowledge base by attempting to further clarify the meaning of self-direction and to develop an instrument reflecting that perspective. The concerns with the scale seem real and legitimate;  however,  only through further research will it be possible to confirm, refute,  or modify the legitimacy  of these concerns.

## A META-ANALYSIS OF QUANTITATIVE STUDIES ON SELF-DIRECTION

From the studies presented in this chapter and in Chapter 3, it should be clear that the knowledge base relative to self-direction has mushroomed since the publication  of  Tough's  original  study. With  this  growth  of  knowledge, however, has come the problem of interpreting and synthesizing  this vast body of research. This problem of interpretation is further  compounded  in that the approaches to studying  self-direction discussed in these two chapters (i.e., Chapters 3 and 4), while clearly the major approaches,  are not the only instruments by which self-direction has been studied. Using meta-analysis, a statistical procedure designed to allow for the integration of findings from a large number of individual studies, McCune (1989a) sought to synthesize the findings of quantitative studies on self-direction reported between 1977 and  1987.

Through  an extensive computer search of literature covering  the  study period,  McCune  identified  103 studies  addressing  self-direction  in  adult learning. Of these, 67 met criteria necessary for inclusion in the data analysis (e.g., based on empirical data and reported in a way that provided enough information for the meta-analysis). Nearly half of the investigators for these studies (47.8 percent) came from the field  of adult education, while another 25.4 percent were from nursing. The 67 studies used 18 different  approaches to measure self-direction, the most frequent  of these being the SDLRS, the Tough  interview  schedule  (or  a  modified  version  of  the  schedule),  the

reported  number  of  hours  devoted  to  self-directed  learning  activity,  and course participation/persistence/completion.

McCune found that "adult self-direction in learning has been investigated with a diversity of demographic and psychosocial/behavioral variables" that can be grouped into eighteen different categories (McCune, 1989a: 121). In assessing the relationship across studies between self-directedness and these variables, McCune offered  these observations:

The findings of this study indicate that the following variables are associated with self-direction  in learning: (a) degree of self-directed learning activity (r = 0.242); (b) positive self-concept (r = 0.230);  (c) educational attainment level (r =0.200);  (d) self-development (r = 0.194); (e) autonomy (r = 0.165);  (f)  ability to master the environment in work, school, play, or social relations (r = 0.147); and (g) factors related to longevity on the job (r = 0.138).

(McCune, 1988: p.  126)

The relationships between self-direction and other variables (such as age, gender, positive attitude  about life or learning,  dependence, and  environmental factors that discourage learning efforts)  were "uncertain", because these relationships seem to have been influenced by "selected independent  variables within the studies" (McCune, 1988:  125).

All  in all, this study is  an important contribution to the literature for it provides further confirmation across studies of relationships  that have been hinted  at previously. While, as McCune cautions, causation should not be implied from this correlational study, it seems clear that her findings give us a  much clearer picture  about the relative importance  of certain  variables vis-a-vis self-direction than was previously possible. While meta-analysis, as is true with any research methodology, has its limitations, its effective use rests on the assumption that a phenomenon has been studied sufficiently  to warrant  a  large-scale  synthesis.  McCune's  investigation  can  be  used  as evidence to further confirm what we have been stressing throughout the book -that  while  many questions remain unanswered, self-direction  has been demonstrated to be one of the brightest lights in research efforts  throughout the adult education field.

## CONCLUSION

Studies designed to measure an individual's level of self-directedness have clearly moved the body of knowledge in this area well beyond descriptions of the frequency  and nature of self-directed learning activities. At the same time, concerns have been raised about both of the key instruments  designed to measure self-directedness. To a large extent,  these concerns can be linked

## 82 The underlying  knowledge  base

to questions about how self-direction  is defined and the theoretical underpinnings of the concept. The third stream of research, qualitative investigations, takes the knowledge base one step further by attempting to develop theory relative to self-direction in adult learning.  These studies are considered in the next chapter.

## Beyond the iceberg: expanding the knowledge base through qualitative approaches

The previous two chapters have highlighted research  on self-direction  employing  designs  involving  the quantitative analysis  of data. Clearly,  these kinds  of studies have had a major  impact on current understanding  of the phenomenon of self-direction. Some of the most important research findings in this area, however, have emerged as a result of still another methodology. The third major  branch of research on self-direction  in adult learning  has consisted of studies employing naturalistic research designs and qualitative data analysis procedures. Qualitative research, which includes such strategies as participant observation, case study, and in-depth interviewing, is characterized  by  the  following:  studying  phenomena  in  their  natural  setting; collecting  descriptive  data that are usually not analyzed  through  statistical methods; a focus on process  as well as outcomes;  inductive data analysis; and an emphasis on the importance of "meaning" that participants  attach to their  experiences (Bogdan  and  Biklen,  1982).  Whereas  quantitative  approaches such as survey, correlational, and experimental/quasi-experimental designs stress the testing of existing theory, qualitative researchers focus on building theory from  the "bottom  up" -  an approach that is referred to as "grounded  theory".

In the current effort to gain greater understanding  of self-direction in adult learning, qualitative approaches have been the most recent stream of inquiry to  evolve  and,  we  believe,  offer  much  toward  creating  a  greater understanding of the context in which self-directed learning takes place, and the many meanings that learners and educators attach to the concept of learner self-direction. Several major studies on self-direction in learning employing the qualitative approach  are reviewed in the following sections.

## 84 The underlying  knowledge base

## QUALITATIVE STUDIES OF SELF-DIRECTION

## Experts without formal training

"One of the most promising sources of knowledge about self-education is the lives of people  who became  expert in a field  which did not include  formal training" (Gibbons, et a/.,  1980:  44). Based on this rationale,  Gibbons and his  colleagues  analyzed  the  content  of  twenty  individuals  "who  became expert without formal training past high school or the equivalent" (except for one person  who completed  one  year of  college).  These  individuals were classified according to four categories:

- 1  entertainers;
- 2  inventors, explorers, and creators;

As each biography was read, items considered  to pertain  to the "nature, life,  or times" of subjects  were recorded. In all,  154 themes emerged  from the data. Of these, the 20 most prominent characteristics,  as determined by the ratings ascribed by the readers, were as follows:

- 1  Primary experience in the area
- 2  Industriousness
- 3  Perseverance
- 4  Self-disciplined  study
- 5  Curiosity
- 6  Single-minded pursuit
- 7 Creativity
- 8  Ingenuity
- 9  Self-confidence

- 10 Natural ability
- 11 Assertiveness
- 12  Intelligence
- 13 Independent  exploration
- 14  Observation
- 15  Confirmational support from others
- 16 Integrity;
- 17 Nonconformity
- 18  Ambition
- 19 Effect of the economic environment
- 20  Effect of personal major achievements

Based on these characteristics,  Gibbons  and his colleagues  drew several conclusions  about differences in the assumptions  underlying  self-directed learning and formal schooling.  First, there is much greater diversity in the kinds  of  expertise  and  skills needed  by  the  self-educated  experts  than  is generally stressed in formal schooling.  Second, the expertise  developed by these  individuals appears  to have  grown  out  of extracurricular  activities; school  generally played an insignificant or negative role in developing  this expertise. Third, the twenty  experts tended to focus their efforts on their area of  expertise rather  than develop less  in-depth knowledge  about  a  broader range of topics. Fourth, there was a strong, active, experiential orientation to the learning efforts. Fifth, these individuals  tended to possess  characteristics that  enabled  them  to  pursue  their  areas  of  expertise  despite  great  odds, failures, and public disapproval.

Based  on  these  findings,  Gibbons, et  al laid  a  tentative  foundation consisting of fourteen principles that  they suggest  could contribute to a  theory of self-education. Among the suggestions were the following: "that  selfeducation  can  help  individuals assume  control  for  their  own  learning, undertake learning for specific  use in the present, promote personal integrity, and develop expertise in an area while remaining open to exploring many fields of activity" (Brockett, et al, 1982: 174).

In a critical assessment of the Gibbons, et al. study and how it has been utilized by adult education researchers  to date, Long and Agyekum (1990) concluded that the work has not had a great influence on practice relative to self-direction  in learning.  While  the study has been  cited  by  a number of authors in the field, emphasis of this writing  has typically  been on the research methodology rather than on the findings themselves. In providing an analysis of the first three principles, Long and Agyekum  conclude that the principles have limited use in their current form; however, the principles may, in fact, be useful  in analyzing other literature and in promoting the development of research efforts based on the findings.

## 86 The underlying  knowledge base

## A fellowship of learning

A second  qualitative  study of self-direction  in adult learning  employed  a different approach. Using a "semi-structured interview," Brookfield (1981b) studied  25  adults who, like  the  subjects  in the  Gibbons, et al. study, had become acknowledged experts in their fields without formal preparation.  As with the study by Gibbons, et al., Brookfield's research differed  from  the learning  projects  studies  in that  it concentrated  not on the subjects' entire range of learning  activities,  but rather emphasized  only  learning  related  to the individuals' area of expertise.  Unlike Gibbons and his colleagues,  however, Brookfield gathered his data first-hand, from the subjects  themselves.

Brookfield  identified  two  criteria  that  had  to  be  met  by  prospective subjects  in  order  for  them  to  be  included  in  the  study  sample.  For  each individual:

[learning] has to have resulted in the development of such a high level of expertise that the learner had been awarded the acclaim of fellow enthusiasts  at  local  or  national  level,  and  such  expertise  had  to  have  been developed  without participation  in  externally planned  programmes  of instruction  (such as adult education classes, correspondence courses  or in-service training  schemes).

(Brookfield,  198  Ib: 17)

Some of the areas of expertise identified by Brookfield's sample were organic gardening,  chess,  philosophy,  record  collecting,  animal  breeding,  narrow gauge railways, and pigeon racing. Length of involvement in these activities ranged from four years for a person engaged in drama production to 50 years for a  beekeeper.

A number  of  themes  were  identified  from  the  data.  One  such  theme revolved around three attitudes toward learning that seemed to be shared by many of the independent  learners. First, these learners tended to view their involvement as ongoing, with no identified end point to their study. Second, they  did  not  feel  constrained  to  limit  their  study  to  "conventional  study boundaries" (Brookfield, 198 Ib:  20).  Rather,  many  of  the  individuals preferred to expand their explorations into other related areas. For example, a person  interested in botany  also  felt  it important to spend  time studying birds and insects.  Similarly, an expert in steam engines was also interested in other modes of transportation, such as canals. Third, these adults believed themselves to belong to a larger "fellowship of learning" (Brookfield, 198 Ib: 20).  While  individuals  assumed  primary  responsibility  for  planning  and carrying out their learning  activities, the learners did not work in  isolation from  others who shared their interest. Indeed, one of the criteria for  being considered an "expert" was acknowledgement  of such status by one's peers.

This  finding  supports  the  contention  of  many  (e.g.,  Knowles,  1975)  that self-direction does  not necessarily  mean learning that takes  place in isolation.

Related to this third attitude is probably one of the most important findings of the study. Brookfield has noted that the learners he interviewed  expressed both a spirit of cooperation  and competitiveness.  On the one hand, learners emphasized  their  identification  as  part  of  a  group  of  individuals  with  a common interest. As such, they were willing to share their knowledge and experience  with their  peers.  On  the  other  hand, however,  it  was  seen  as important  by  the  experts  to have  their  abilities  recognized by their  peers through  awards  and  competitive  success.  In  fact,  several  of  the  learners identified  the opportunity  for competitive  success as a primary reason  for undertaking the learning endeavor.

A portion of Brookfield's discussion centered on the evaluation of independent adult learning. A distinction was made between subjective  indices of  evaluation  (exemplified primarily  through the learners'  increased  confidence in their abilities, to the point where they felt capable  of judging the ideas  and  writings of  experts  in  the  field)  and objective  indices  (such  as recognition and comparison by their peers). To some extent, these  indices can be related to the cooperative and competitive elements mentioned above. Some objective indices,  for example, include requests for  advice,  written contributions, and talks to interested groups. Each of these reflect a sense of cooperation  -  a  willingness to share  one's  expertise.  At the same time, possessing  a level of expertise sufficient  to question other experts -  essentially  stating that one's own ideas or observations  are more  appropriate  demonstrates  a competitive nature. Perhaps  it is here  that  Brookfield  has made a major  contribution  to theory relative to self-direction  in  learning. Certainly  he has raised  some important areas  for  further  examination  and reflection.

## The Vermont  study

While the methodologies employed by Gibbons  and his colleagues  (1980) and  Brookfield  (1981b)  differ  considerably,  they  share  an  emphasis  on studying individuals with limited formal preparation in their field of endeavor. In a third major qualitative study, Leean and Sisco (1981) investigated self-directed learning among rural adults  in Vermont who had completed less than 12 years of formal education. This 18-month project consisted of three major phases:  (a) a replication  of the learning projects  methodology  based on a sample of 93 adults; (b) a case study process involving  14 of the original 93  individuals;  and  (c)  dissemination  of  findings,  including conference presentations and retreats involving consultants  with expertise  in selfdirected  learning  and  naturalistic  inquiry.  It  is  perhaps  the  case  study

## 88 The underlying  knowledge base

component of this investigation that has provided some of the most insightful findings.

In the case study phase, fourteen individuals were selected  on the basis of representativeness by  age,  gender,  and  educational background.  Over  a 6-month  period,  three  researchers  spent  about  14 hours  with each  of  the participants.  Data collection  included several protocols, such as interactive exercises  and conversational  interviews,  that  allowed  the  investigators  to obtain  a wide range of qualitative data.

Using Lewin's Field Theory (1951) as aconceptual base, Leean and Sisco were able to look at the influence of learning on the lives of the  interviewees across a chronological  progression  of time -  past, present, and future.  This framework  allowed  the researchers  to  consider  learning from  a  holistic perspective.  While  the  importance  of  integrating  these  three  time  phases cannot  be  separated,  Leean  and Sisco pointed  out that the  major  findings relative to self-directed learning  were noted within the "present" time perspective.  Major  findings  related  to  self-direction  can  be  summarized  as follows:

- 1  Learning  is seen  as a part of everyday living  as people are continually challenged  by their environments to solve problems  as well as explore interests. Suggests that "undereducated"  should be  perceived as learners who already have skills.
- 2  Thinking  is connected  to times when people  are alone, usually doing  a mundane or repetitive chore or task. Suggests that self-directed learning involves work done in the mind before  it is done with the hands.
- 3 The  ways people  talked  about  how  they  go  about  their  self-directed learning  varied,  but  most  referred  to  visualizing  the  end  state  of  the learning goal before they entered into the effort. Suggests further  exploration of the  process ofvisualization  as a guide or motivating phenomenon in self-directed learning.
- 4  Learning since leaving school has been varied, challenging and meaningful.  People  commented on how much more they have learned outside of the public school context. They enjoy self-directed learning because they can do it at their own pace  and without anybody judging  them. This is consistent  with  findings from  other research  on  self-directed  learning. Suggests self-directed learning should be taken seriously as an alternative  form  of  learning.
- 5  The cognitive profiles of the group looked like a normal distribution of other populations  tested. Suggests  that  the  number  of years  of  formal education is not necessarily correlated to one's cognitive  abilities.
- 6 Both men and women expressed a belief in the value of  commonsense thinking and rational problem solving, providing many examples of how

## Expanding  the knowledge  base 89

they  do  this. Suggests  that  self-directed learning  is guided  by  innate abilities of the rational mind.

- 1 Most  recognized  times  when  they  got  answers  to  problems  through non-rational means. Again, many experiences  were related.  Descriptive names  given  to  this  way  of  thinking  were;  "back-burner thinking," "dream  thinking," "psychic," "spontaneous," "passage thinking." Suggests  alternative  states  of  consciousness  may be helpful in one's self-directed learning efforts.
- 8  Developmentally, the group was dispersed  in a bell-shaped  curve using Loevinger dimensions of preconventional, conventional and postconventional.  Factors  which  seemed  to  impede  and  enhance  developmental movement were evident in many of their statements about  themselves. These obstacles  tended to be a limited sense  of self and the inability to resolve  contradictions  in one's life. Suggests more attention be paid  to how developmental theory can enrich the understanding of adult learning,  especially through the  study  of  growth  enhancing and  impeding factors.
- 9 Having access to resources and information does not appear to be a  major problem of these rural learners. They seem to know where to go for what they need. However, when this was probed more, they did speak  about some frustrations in getting full  and accurate information. Suggests that information  services for  rural  "long-distance learners"  may be helpful if  they are responsive and relevant to specific  needs and contexts of rural learners.

(Leean and Sisco, 1981, Section II:  28-9)

These findings address several areas that previous studies had not explored; in particular, the idea that much self-directed learning occurs through "nonrational" means.  Self-directed  learning,  in  its  ideal  form,  involves a transcendence  not unlike Maslow's  (1970)  "peak experience." Leean and Sisco found  evidence  to support  this idea. Perhaps  there is a link between this finding and the notion of nondeliberate learning as addressed by Ingham (1984), which was discussed in Chapter 2.

## The organizing  circumstance

To what extent do self-directed  learners consciously  preplan their learning activities? With the development of models designed to provide a  process for undertaking self-directed  learning projects, some of which are considered in later chapters, it would seem worthwhile to consider the extent to which such processes  are,  indeed, used by self-directed learners.  In a secondary analysis of qualitative data based on interviews  with  78 self-directed learners

## 90 The underlying  knowledge  base

who had less than high school completion, Spear and Mocker (1984) found that such preplanning usually does not exist.

Spear  and Mocker  have suggested  that the concept  of the "organizing circumstance" can be  used  to  understand  this  finding.  According  to  the investigators,  the  organizing  circumstance  "postulates that  self-directed learners,  rather  than  preplanning  their  learning  projects,  tend  to  select  a course from limited alternatives which occur fortuitously within their environment, and which structures their learning projects"  (Spear  and Mocker, 1984: 4). From their findings, Spear and Mocker have presented a typology that can be used to distinguish  four patterns through which the  organizing circumstance  can be found  to exist. The categories  of the typology  are as follows.

## Type  I -  Single  event/anticipated  learning

This category refers to situations where  an adult  enters into a learning activity perceived  to be required, where he or she has  little understanding of what needs  to  be  learned  or  how  to  learn  it.  The  learner  thus  enters  with  the expectation that the "means for learning will  be contained within the situation and  available  to  them"  (Spear  and  Mocker, 1984:  5).  Many  on-the-job training experiences  fall  into this category.

## Type  II -  Single  event/unanticipated  learning

This category is similar to the Type I category in that tasks are performed by individuals on a frequent and repeated basis. However, within this category, individuals do not view themselves as engaged in a learning process.

## Type  III-  Series  of events/related  learning

Some self-directed learning projects can be seen as a series of episodes that, on the surface, give the appearance of being a linear progression  toward a future  goal.  In  actuality,  the  series of events builds upon previous  events. However, this progression  was not deliberate on the part of the learner. In fact, such learners are usually unable to have foreseen the "logical" progression from episode to episode.

## Type  IV-Series of events/unrelated  learning

Type  IV  situations  develop  over  a  longer  period  of  time  than  Type  III situations but are the accumulation of various unrelated learning  experiences. According to Spear and Mocker (1984:7), this category "is both a cumulative

## Expanding  the knowledge  base 91

and culminating  circumstance uniting previously unrelated sets or series of circumstances".

Spear and  Mocker's conclusions, which seem to challenge the oft-accepted view  that  self-directed  learning  is  a clearly  deliberate,  well-planned, and linear series of episodes  are reflected in the following statement:

Because self-directed learning occurs in a  natural environment dominated by  chance  elements  and  is  in  contrast  to  the  artificial  and  controlled elements which characterize formal instructional environments, it seems useful to investigate the possibly differing  effects of the natural environments on the learning process. This is opposed to seeking  to understand self-directed  learning by imposing  what is known about formal learning upon it,

(Spear and Mocker,  1984: 9)

The issues Spear and Mocker raise are relevant ones that could provide some valuable directions for future inquiry.

## Self-directed learning in higher education  settings

While  most  qualitative  investigations  of  self-direction  have  emphasized learning outside of the classroom, there remains a need to look more fully at self-direction within the institutional setting. As was noted in Chapters 1 and 2, self-direction  can be viewed as existing on a continuum and can, indeed, take place in institutional settings. Kasworm (1988a, 1988b) undertook two exploratory investigations  in order to support  a conceptual  framework for self-directed  learning  in  institutions.  In the  first  study, Kasworm  (1988a) conducted semi-structured interviews with seven adults enrolled in graduate courses at a university in a large metropolitan area. Drawing in part from the models presented by Knowles (1975)  and Tough (1979),  Kasworm  essentially  found  support  for  the presence  and potential  of self-direction  in  the graduate classroom.  However, she pointed out that because this study was based  on  a  very  limited  sample,  and  was  based  on  a  graduate student population, the findings must be viewed in a most tentative way.

For this reason,  Kasworm (1988b) undertook a follow-up investigation that sought to examine the same phenomenon with a group of undergraduate adult learners who pursued college credit on a part-time basis and held  fullor part-time jobs. Ten individuals were randomly selected and interviewed. Of these individuals,  70 percent reported that "their reentry into college was related  to  an expected  delayed gratification that they projected  would be fulfilled  upon completion of the degree" (Kasworm, 1988b: 9). Noting that each  of  the  interviewees  was  able  to  share  examples  of  themselves  as self-directed learners, and pointing out that most of the respondents  felt that

## 92 The underlying  knowledge base

self-directed learning is desirable for most adults, Kasworm asked  respondents to discuss  how they perceived  their role  as active/passive  learners  in credit  courses.

Four  patterns  of  responses  were  identified.  One  pattern  was  a  clear preference for a self-directed approach stressing informal learning and minimizing  competitive,  test-oriented  learning.  A  second  pattern  involved  a "selective" combination of self-directed and more structured approaches.  A third pattern was a preference for "quality structured learning" with a clear set of expectations.  Finally, a fourth pattern was a preference  for structured classes and an attitude of compliance  with the system in order to "just get through."

While the limited size of the samples from these studies make it necessary to view the findings in an exploratory way, this research reemphasizes  that self-direction can indeed be a vital part of learning in institutions. At the same time, it is a  mistake to assume that all learners have the same level of readiness for  self-directed  learning.  These  findings have  implications  for the  teaching/learning  transaction  as  well  as  for  the  development  of  institutional policies relative to self-direction. Such implications are discussed in Chapters 6 and 8, respectively.

## Librarians and self-directed  learners

In  order  to  better  understand  the  role  of  the  facilitator  in  self-directed learning,  Smith  (1990)  focused  on  one  type  of  facilitator  the  public librarian.  Twenty-two librarians  from  a public library  system  in  a northeastern  U.S.  metropolitan  area  were  interviewed  using  a  semistructured interview process.  Using a modified, constant comparative method of qualitative data analysis, Smith's findings centered on four major themes relative to the following questions.

- 1  What is a public library?
- 2  Do self-directed learners use the library?
- 3  What materials,  services,  and programs do librarians  make available to learners?
- 4  How do public librarians interact with learners?

With regard  to  the  first  question, three  aspects  of  the  library  were noted consistently; "the  public library as physical space  (building, arrangement, and furniture); people (staff,  library users, and the community-at-large that supports it); non-physical environment (the atmosphere, e.g., warmth, friendliness, quiet, that the library projects to the community)" (Smith, 1990:243). Of particular interest is the non-physical  environment  aspect. Here,  Smith pointed out that nearly "all of the librarians interviewed were concerned  that

their libraries be warm, friendly places, a welcoming, rather than a threatening institution  in the community"  (Smith, 1990:  244),

Regarding  the second question,  Smith noted  that every one of the  librarians "had  at least  one or two stories  or examples"  of self-directed  learners with whom they had worked, and many had "at least a working definition of what this type of learning meant to them*' (Smith, 1990:245). Based on these findings,  Smith  proposed  a  tentative model  that  distinguishes  between "timid"  and  "confident" learners.  She  contends  that  interactions with  a librarian might be a way for timid learners to develop into confident learners.

As for the resources  made available to learners,  it is clear  that the  book remains the primary resource  utilized by library learners. Yet programming (either  of  an  educational  or  entertainment  nature)  and services (such  as reference/reader guidance or educational brokering) were sometimes identified  as relevant learning  resources.

Finally, with regard to the ways in which librarians  interact  with users, Smith found that typically, a set of maxims (i.e., unwritten rules) somewhat analogous  to Schon's (1987)  idea of "knowing-in-action" were  combined with a process of "negotiating  the question," which is a way of  responding to the unique situation  of each individual user.

This  study  makes  an  important  contribution  to  the  knowledge  base because it addresses implications both for the facilitation of self-directed learning  and the  ways in which institutions can respond  to self-directed learners.  These  issues  are  also  discussed  further  in  Chapters  6  and  8, respectively.

## Other qualitative  studies

Several  other  studies  have  investigated  self-direction  through  the  use  of naturalistic designs and qualitative data analysis. The following five  investigations are dissertation  studies, three of which were conducted  at Teachers College, Columbia University. For example, Zabari (1985) examined the role of self-directed learning  as an approach  to continuing  education for practitioners in the field  of gerontology. Semistructured interviews with eighteen senior  center  directors  revealed  the  following  four  types  of self-directed learning activities: "job-framing, resource seeking, feedback and evaluation seeking,  and  making sense  of experience"  (Zabari,  1985:  1061A).  Zabari found  that the interviewees developed "along  a continuum of autonomous functioning  determined by the way in which they negotiated  learning  activities" (Zabari, 1985:  1061  A).

In another study, Bauer (1986) used a case-study approach to examine the first 3 years of operation  of the Adult Education Guided Independent Study (AEGIS) program, an alternative doctoral program in adult education offered

## 94 The underlying  knowledge base

by  Teachers  College,  Columbia  University.  Through  document  analysis, observation,  and interviews with students, faculty, and administrators, Bauer described  how various functions of the program interfaced  administratively with the college in general. She  concluded that the development of innovative programs requires an intensive personal commitment on the part of professionals; therefore, "institutions  must provide  stronger  support to faculty in substantive areas of tenure criteria, monetary reward for involvement of this kind,  and  adjustment of  teaching  and  administrative  load*'  (Bauer,  1986: 2518A). The AEGIS program is discussed further in Chapter 8.

Two recent qualitative investigations have attempted to provide greater conceptual  clarity  for  the  concept  of  self-direction.  Gerstner  (1988)  conducted  a critical  review of self-directed  learning  as reflected  in the North American and British literature between the years 1920 and 1986. Drawing from progressive, humanist, behaviorist, and critical philosophical  orientations, Gerstner identified four variations on the self-directed learning theme: "(1) instrumental learning; (2) self-knowledge; (3) self-management; and (4) as a personal attribute" (Gerstner,  1988: 27  A). This model is both similar to and different from the PRO model that serves as a foundation throughout this book.

Candy (1988)  also investigated the concept  of "self-direction".  As was noted in Chapter 2, Candy  distinguished between self-direction as a personal attribute,  an  approach  to  learning  that takes  place  outside  of  institutions (autodidaxy), and as a way of providing learner control  over the  learning process. From a critical analysis of literature as well as a conceptual analysis process, Candy's eight major findings were as follows:

(1) lack of internal consistency in the literature precludes the development of  a  coherent  'theory  of  self-direction*  from  within  the  literature;  (2) autodidaxy can be usefully distinguished from learner-control;  (3) autonomy in learning does not necessarily lead to personal autonomy, nor does personal  autonomy always manifest itself  in the learning  situation;  (4) autonomy  has  both  personal  and  situational  dimensions; (5)  understanding the perspective of learners is vital to understanding  strategies used and outcomes attained; (6) personal autonomy in learning  comprises both cross-situational and situation-specific dimensions; (7) research into learning  outcomes  should  stress  qualitative  rather  than  quantitative dimensions of knowledge acquisition; and (8) constructivism  sanctions action-research and other naturalistic inquiry modes.

(Candy, 1988:1033A)

Based on these findings, he suggests a research  agenda developed  from  a constructions  t perspective.

Finally, in a study that seems to take the Gibbons, et al. (1980) study a

## Expanding  the knowledge  base 95

step  further,  Cavaliere  (1989)  used  content  analysis  of  biographical and historical data from  a 28-year period  in order to examine  "the  independent learning processes utilized by the Wright brothers which led to their invention of  the  airplane"  (Cavaliere, 1989:  2894a).  She  noted  that  the behaviors employed  by  the  Wright  brothers  during  this  process  were  "repetitive, cyclical,  and progressive.  The data analyses demonstrated that learning does not occur in isolation  and  defined goals can be accomplished  through practice and perseverance" (Cavaliere,  1989:  2894A). To a large degree, these characteristics  support  those identified by Gibbons  and his  colleagues.

## Contributions  and limitations of qualitative  investigations

Clearly, the studies in this chapter indicate that qualitative research  methods have greatly extended the boundaries of knowledge relative to self-direction in  learning.  In our  view, qualitative  approaches  to studying  self-direction have made at least  two major contributions  to the knowledge  base  in  this area.  First,  this stream  of inquiry has contributed  to theory-building  efforts relative to self-direction. Concepts such as Brookfield's fellowship of learning,  or Spear  and Mocker*s organizing circumstance,  along with Leean and Sisco's findings  relative to the potential impact of altered states of consciousness  on  self-directed  learning  processes, and  Kasworm's  findings  about self-direction  among  adult college  students, probably  would not have  been as  likely  to  be  uncovered  through  the  use  of  standardized  measures  of self-direction.

A second contribution of the qualitative paradigm can be seen in the thread that runs through many of the studies discussed in this chapter. The  samples selected  for the studies by Gibbons, et a/., Brookfield, Leean and Sisco, and Spear  and  Mocker  were  comprised  of  adults  with  low  levels  of  formal education or no formal training  in their area of expertise.  It can be argued that many adults who fit into the category of "undereducated" are less likely to respond  to standardized scales than those individuals whose more extensive participation in formal learning experiences  may have helped  them to feel more experienced with such instruments. In other words, it is likely that qualitative methods can play a valuable role in studying  segments of the  adult population that are frequently overlooked in research  efforts.

While the qualitative paradigm has made what we believe to be a significant contribution to research efforts in this area, the approach is not without its parameters. First, although this method is certainly  appropriate  for studying problems from a sociological or anthropological perspective, qualitative  approaches  are  probably  not  as  useful  in  studies focusing  on personality  dimensions, such as those that fall within the bounds of learner

## 96 The underlying  knowledge base

self-direction, since they generally focus on social processes and interactions rather than internal psychological processes.

In addition, some would argue that qualitative findings are not generalizable to other populations,  since such considerations as random selection of subjects, manipulation of independent variables, and tests of statistical  significance  are not part of  the  methodology. However, Bogdan  and Biklen (1982)  suggest  that  generalizability  can  also  be  considered  in  terms  of application  to  related situations rather than populations.  In this  way, the findings of qualitative investigations can, indeed, have implications beyond the specific study addressed.

## THE UNDERLYING KNOWLEDGE BASE: AN ASSESSMENT

In this and the previous two chapters, we have attempted to present a look at the research  efforts  that support  the underlying knowledge base of selfdirection in adult  learning. The questions that  remain  center on assessing how valuable  this  research  has  been  in  helping  us  to  better  understand  the phenomenon of self-direction and how it might impact upon the practice of adult education. As a way of bringing this review of research to a close, we will present our assessment of the knowledge base by first looking at some of the critiques that have been written about this research  area and then by summarizing some of our own conclusions.

In  1984,  Brookfield  offered  what  he  called  a  "critical  paradigm"  of self-directed  adult learning (Brookfield, 1984c). The rationale for this paradigm was that  while  research such as the learning  projects approach had made a clear contribution to the knowledge base, there was a clear need to move further - "to infuse a spirit of self-critical scrutiny into this developing  field of research" (Brookfield, 1984c; 60). Essentially, Brookfield identified the following four criticisms of the research up to that time:

- 1  Research  on  self-directed  learning  was  based  almost  entirely  on middle-class samples; studies of "working class" adults were largely ignored;
- 2 There  was  an almost exclusive emphasis  on studying self-directed learning through quantitative approaches - the  qualitative orientation was generally overlooked;
- 3 The  research  had  been  characterized  by  an  overemphasis  on  the individual dimension of self-directed learning without consideration of the social context in which such learning takes place; and
- 4  Little  consideration had been given to implications of  existing research findings for "questions of social and political change".

(Brookfield,  1984c: 60).

Brookfield  argued  that  until  these  four  issues  could  be  addressed  and resolved, research on self-direction would be limited to merely  reinterpreting what had already been well  documented.

In a  response to this critique, the first author of this book (Brockett, 1985c) presented  an alternative view of the four criticisms.  Regarding the overemphasis on middle-class samples, it was agreed that while there was some truth to this view, groups traditionally viewed as "hard-to-reach"  had been studied more widely than suggested by Brookfield. Several examples were used to support this view (e.g., Hiemstra, 1975; Umoren, 1978; Baghi, 1979; Leean and  Sisco,  1981).  As  for  the  concern  about  excessive  use  of  quantitative research approaches, the "three streams" model that has served as a guide in this  book  was used  to  refute  Brookfield's  claim.  Here,  it  was noted  that "self-directed learning at this time is an excellent example of a research area where  qualitative and quantitative  approaches  have  been  used  to  explore distinct pieces of the puzzle" (Brockett, 1985c: 57). On the final two concerns raised by Brookfield, there was basic  agreement; the sociopolitical  dimensions of self-direction were, and continue to be, essentially overlooked.  These issues  "are  amplified  in  situations  where  individuals view  themselves  as powerless in determining the direction of their lives"  and, as such, present both positive  and negative potential consequences  for "promoting  selfdirection  in societies  where individual human rights may be  in  question" (Brockett, 1985c: 58).

A final commentary by Brookfield (1985b)  helps to illuminate  the spirit in which the above exchange was undertaken. While points of disagreement remained, the exchange "was  presented  in the spirit of furthering genuine dialogue"  (Brookfield, 1985b: 60). "Essentially,  we have the same  concern. We are disturbed at the creeping  orthodoxy  which threatens  to exercise  a conceptual stranglehold on research and theoretical speculation in this field" (Brookfield, 1985b: 64). Today, with the advantage of several years perspective since the original publication of the exchange, this "spirit" remains the real contribution of this exchange. In our view, concerns about the research being dominated by middle-class samples and quantitative designs are less of a concern than they were in 1984. On the other hand, concerns  about the sociopolitical dimension of self-direction remain valid today, though some theoretical headway has been made on this front  (see Chapters 2, 6, and 10 for examples). But it was the tone of the Brookfield-Brockett dialogue that made the series  of articles more constructive than confrontational,  and, in retrospect, this is the real contribution of the exchange,

So,  then,  where  do  things  stand  relative  to  the  knowledge  base  of self-direction? We believe that several conclusions  can be drawn. First, it is clear  from  the vast body of learning projects research,  that self-directed learning activity is, indeed, "a way of life" that cuts across socioeconomic

## 98 The underlying  knowledge  base

strata.  It is, to be sure, highly visible in middle-class  U.S. society.  But it is also thriving in groups traditionally deemed "hard-to-reach** for adult education  programming: older adults; minorities; rural residents;  low-income adults; persons with low levels of formal education; and adults who demonstrate expertise in a particular area despite lack of formal preparation in that area. It is also found,  in varying degrees,  within societies outside of North America and Western Europe.

Second, and related to the above point, it would appear that most findings related to measures of self-directedness and various demographic  variables are inconclusive. The possible exception is educational attainment and, even here, the findings are not overwhelming. This perhaps lends further  support to the point made above, that self-direction does indeed cut across the entire adult population and holds promise for individuals regardless of their demographic background.

Third, it can be said with a high degree of confidence  that there is a link between  self-direction  and self-concept.  A bit  more  tentatively,  the  same thing  can  be  said  for  the  link  between  self-direction  and  life satisfaction (although  these  latter  findings  have  been  drawn  only  from  older  adult samples).  These findings  indicate  that self-direction  is clearly  reflected  in how adults perceive  themselves and the quality of their lives.

Fourth,  the  findings relative  to  self-direction  and certain psychosocial variables - such as  locus of control, intellectual development, and hemisphericity  paint  a  mixed  picture.  The  study  of  hemisphericity  might be particularly instructive to future researchers.  As was pointed out in Chapter 4,  it  is  possible  that the  inconclusive  findings  are  linked  to  the  idea  that self-direction  might be tied  to certain elements of both left  and  right  brain hemispheric orientation. Hence,  it may be entirely appropriate  to arrive at different  findings, especially given that various researchers may ope  rationalize the variables in different  ways. Our conclusion  is that some  variables simply do not easily fit into the conceptualization  of self-direction.

Fifth,  despite the concerns raised by Brookfield  (1985b) that research in this area has over-relied on quantitative measurement of the concept, we are encouraged by the methodological diversity that continues to evolve in the study of self-direction. As can be seen from studies reported  earlier  in this chapter, the last half of the 1980s  has witnessed an  increase in studies utilizing the qualitative paradigm. There is every reason to be optimistic that this trend will continue.

Sixth, legitimate  concerns have been voiced about both of the instruments that have  been used to measure self-direction (i.e., the SDLRS and the OCLI). However, in spite of these concerns,  both  the SDLRS  and the OCLI  have been vital to the development of the knowledge base. The developers of each instrument  continue  to  work  at  refinements of  their  scales  and  we  are

## Expanding  the knowledge  base 99

encouraged by this (Guglielmino, 1989; Oddi, personal communication with R, Brockett, January, 1990). Until alternative measures of self-direction  can be developed, based perhaps on some of the new ways in which the phenomenon is being conceptualized,  further research with these scales is encouraged, so long as validation work continues on a study-by-study  basis.

Finally, our review leads us to conclude that self-direction  can and should serve  as  a  model  for  the  field  of  adult  education  in  terms  of  how  to systematically develop a research base over time. While some may wish to view the research  over the past two decades as a fad that has just about run its  course,  we believe  that this kind of thinking  in the past  has  cost adult education  a great  deal in terms of its development  as a field of study. In Chapter  13, we offer  a number of recommendations  pertaining  to how this research base may continue to develop in coming years.

## CONCLUSION

In this chapter, we have examined the third stream of research on self-direction in learning:  studies employing the qualitative or naturalistic  paradigm. Although this  stream does not compare  in mere volume with the other  two approaches, it has perhaps been the most valuable in terms of theory development. In our overall assessment of the knowledge base in self-direction, we believe that the picture  is generally bright, especially  when compared with most other research  areas in adult education. Yet, there is much more that remains to be done.

## Part III

## Process and  personal orientation

The PRO model is built around the premise  that personal responsibility  for learning is both desirable  and effective. Such personal responsibility  can be fostered by a skilled facilitator or aided by the right kind of learning resource. It also is a learning  attribute that can be enhanced  in most adults. This part builds on such notions.

The first chapter, 6, describes how self-directed learning can be facilitated through a learning process orientation. After a  description of how andragogical notions, principles, and literature have been foundational to our thinking, we detail an individualized teaching and learning process. The process is one we have developed based  on our experiences,  understanding of literature, and faith in the ability of learners to accept personal responsibility.

Various  steps  within the process are detailed.  These range  from  ideas about initial planning that must take place even before contact with learners is made to such basic features as helping learners become  acquainted with each other and the process, facilitating needs assessment  activities, and even engaging learners in individual planning or evaluation functions. The chapter concludes with information pertaining  to the type of learning variables that individuals can control and some ideas about the nature of possible learning resources.

Chapter 7 examines the internal, personal orientation component  of the PRO model. It focuses on how learner self-direction and the acceptance of personal  responsibility  can  be  enhanced. A  variety  of influences  on self-direction as reported in the literature is reported, including such varied areas  as the research  on participation, humanist influences, and behavioral influences.

Finally, three important strategies for the enhancement are described. The first centers on notions of how critical reflection can be facilitated. Several specific  activities  are discussed.  The  second  strategy deals  with ways for promoting rational thinking. The third strategy is related to ways that various helping skills can be used to enhance learner  self-direction.

## Facilitating self-directed learning

To some readers it may seem quite a paradox to talk about the facilitation of self-directed learning when self-direction implies learning alone.  However, one of our reasons for writing this book  is to explore  appropriate  roles  for educators  of  adults,  given  this  widespread  interest  in  self-direction.  This chapter  is  designed  to  provide some  initial  ideas  about  the  process  of facilitating  self-direction  from  the instructor's perspective.  Chapter  Seven will deal with self-direction  from the learner's perspective.

As we pointed out in earlier chapters,  some critics  of the  "self-directed learning  movement"  argue  that  the  research  related  to  such  concepts  as andragogy  and  learning  projects  is  flawed  in  some  ways.  As  we  note throughout the book, certainly more research is needed to better understand implications for instruction, program development, and so forth. However, it has been our experience, both in and out of the classroom, that most adults do prefer to assume considerable responsibility for their own learning if given the opportunity and appropriate  support.

In this chapter we describe  how we have translated our knowledge and experience into a teaching and learning process that works for us in facilitating self-directed learning. The collective "we" is used in that we talk about various procedures and techniques that at least one of us uses or has tried. We also will use "you" to communicate directly in terms of our recommendations for your  use of the information in the chapter. Obviously, we can only present you with an accounting of how we translate beliefs and experiences into instructional activities, and you will need to make adaptations that fit your  preferred  teaching  style, philosophical framework, and  institutional requirements.

## ANDRAGOGY: A FOUNDATION FOR SELF-DIRECTED LEARNING?

Much  attention has been given to the North American  version of

## 104 Process and personal orientation

andragogical teaching  and learning  as developed  by Knowles (1980).  His initial description of andragogy (Knowles, 1968), subsequent modifications from  the first  edition of Modern Practice (1970)  to the second  (1980), and descriptions  of various ways in which the process has been used (Knowles and  Associates, 1984)  have  certainly  popularized  the  term.  Appendix  A provides an annotated bibliography of writings that deal directly with andragogy and some of its implied concepts.  For the reader interested in pursuing further variations, Savicevic (1981,1988,1989) describes how certain Eastern European countries have used some form of andragogy.

Popularization  of andragogy has been accompanied by numerous debates for  and  against  the  concept  put  forth by  many writers  (Brookfield,  1986; Candy, 1981; Carlson,  1979; Cross, 1981; Darkenwald and Merriam,  1982; Davenport, 1987; Davenport and Davenport, 1985a, 1985b, 1985c; Day and Baskett, 1982; Elias, 1979; Griffin,  1983; Houle, 1972; Jarvis, 1984; Knudson, 1979; London, 1973; McKenzie, 1977,1979; Podeschi,  1987; Podeschi and Pearson,  1986; Pratt,  1988;  Radial,  1983;  Tennant,  1986;  and Yonge, 1985).  Many North American critics  of the concept argue that differences between adults and children are not significant enough to warrant different teaching and learning approaches. Some people also believe that Knowles is too  dependent on the ability of all people  to accept  individual freedom  in learning. For example,  Pratt (1988) believes that self-direction is a situational attribute  or  "an  impermanent  state  of  being  dependent  on  the  learner's competence, commitment and confidence at a given moment in time*' (Pratt, 1988:  162).

Knowles has responded to some of this criticism by saying he made a mistake  in  subtitling  the  1970  version  of Modern  Practice "Andragogy versus Pedagogy." He now believes the  subtitle should have been  "From Pedagogy to Andragogy," (a subtitle he actually used  in the  1980  second edition)  and that he  should have presented  these  ideas  as two points  on a continuum (Knowles, 1979), rather than as a dichotomy.

Criticism of andragogy outside of North America has taken a somewhat different  turn. Griffin  (1983),  for example, suggests that Knowles fails to account  for  crucial  distinctions  between  individual  purposes  and  social consequences  of  learning.  This  results  in  extreme  individualism  and,  in effect,  "the social functions of adult education are reduced to the sum of the purposes of individual learners" (Griffin,  1983:60). Day and Baskett (1982) suggest that andragogy is not a theory of adult learning at all; rather, it is an educational ideology rooted in an inquiry-based learning and teaching paradigm. Tennant (1986) worries that andragogy places  the individual at the center of a value system that relegates the group to second  place.

We are largely in agreement with Knowles' current view of andragogy as a continuum. We also believe  that individuals can be  assisted  to  become

increasingly more  self-directed when  given  appropriate  learning  tools, resources,  experiences,  and encouragement. This is because  an underlying theme in our interpretation  of teaching  and learning  as a process is that of facilitating  learning, or as Knowles would put it, "self-directed" as opposed to "teacher-directed" learning. In fact, self-directed learning is seen as  a goal, an underlying  assumption  of  andragogy,  and a prevailing  philosophy  for adult education by many in North America (Mezirow, 1985).

Mezirow  (1981)  has  also  described 12  activities  fundamental  to  the enhancement  of learners  becoming  more  self-directed  in  what he  calls  a "charter for andragogy."  For facilitators this involves helping  learners participate  in various  activities,  including  the  assessment  of personal  needs, planning subsequent learning activities, securing or creating necessary learning resources, and assessing  personal  progress in achieving  learning goals. Schuttenberg  and  Tracy  (1987)  believe  there  are  many  different  roles  a facilitator  should  assume,  including  that of  a leader, collaborator,  or  colleague, in promoting varying types of self-directed behavior. In other words, a  facilitator  is not just  a classroom  teacher,  but also can be  a  counselor, consultant, tutor, and resource  locator.

However, for such activities and roles to be successful, a partnership must be developed between learner and facilitator.  We believe this is important so that  issues  like  quality  of  the  experience,  a  personal  desire  to  continue learning  activities,  and obtaining  necessary  support  are considered.  It has been our experience  that such a partnership  works best within an individualized  teaching  and  learning  process. It  involves  mentoring,  building collegiality, helping learners free themselves from expected dependent relationships with  teachers,  and  developing greater  learner  independence. Individualized, as used here, refers more to the  degree of- or potential for learner  control  of  the process than to  independence  of  the  study method (Candy, 1981).

The  purpose  of  this  chapter  is  to  describe such  a  process  and  how facilitation of self-direction or increased learner control is carried out. This, then, is a discussion of the "self-directed  learning"  side of the PRO model described  in Chapter 2. The focus will be primarily on what Mocker  and Spear (1982) refer to as an expected formal relationship between a learner or group of learners and an instructor. We do recognize that  not all self-directed learning activity involves developing such formal roles but, for purposes of this  chapter,  we  stress  the  involvement  of  a  facilitator in  describing  the process.

## PLANNING SELF-DIRECTED LEARNING

Some basic assumptions underlie the notion that self-direction in learning is

## 106 Process and personal orientation

possible,  For example, we accept  that the mature adult is quite capable of assuming  personal  responsibility  for  planning  and  carrying  out  learning activities. Thus we believe that an adult is a person  who fulfils  adult  social roles and who possesses self-directed abilities and beliefs (Mezirow, 1985). However, it has been our experience that most adults, when entering a formal educational setting, initially expect the teacher to'be an authority who passes knowledge on to them as  receptive learners. On the other  hand, research noted earlier, as well as our personal experiences  as facilitators, has shown us how quickly learners will adapt to assuming self-direction in learning. The landmark Learning To Be report (Faure et a/.,  1972) made this point more than 15 years ago:

From the standpoint of lifelong education and in the present state of human knowledge, calling teachers "masters" (whichever of its meanings we  give the word), is more and more an abuse of terms. The teacher's duty is less and less to inculcate knowledge and more and more to encourage thinking ...  [this includes becoming  increasingly]  an advisor,  a partner to talk to, someone who seeks  out conflicting  arguments rather than handing out ready-made truths....  [The  teacher]  will have to devote more time and energy  to  productive  and  creative  activities:  interaction, discussion, stimulation, understanding, encouragement.

(Faure et  al, 1972:77-8)

This interactive role does require lots of time and energy on the part of the teacher  throughout  the process.  In  fact,  we believe  our process  requires considerably more effort than do more traditional, teacher-directed approaches.  A facilitator must be able to provide numerous kinds of support because of the many barriers to self-direction that a learner will face.

As with any teaching  and learning process, an instructor's activities  do not begin during initial contact with learners.  Some  anticipatory  planning takes place, resources are secured, and some thinking is done regarding what is to be expected of learners. Each learner or group of learners will be unique, the  state  of  knowledge regarding  the  subject  will constantly  change,  and needs uncovered during the learning process will provide new information for identifying learning resources and  activities.

Self-directed  learning by  individuals  frequently  is inhibited by  the  absence of a guiding model or plan. Stubblefield (1981  a)  has suggested a  model with four phases. Table 6.1  describes each phase and  provides some questions that should be asked during the planning process. The first phase, initiating, involves  focusing  on  needs,  objectives,  and  benefits  from  the  learning activity. The second phase, planning, involves  identifying  learning resources,  specifying learning  activities,  and establishing  criteria  for  successful

accomplishments.  The next phase, management, involves carrying out the learning activities,  analyzing the information obtained,  and recording  progress  toward  some  personal  changes,  The  final  phase, evaluation, should answer questions as to whether or not objectives were achieved and where do we go from  here.

Spear  and  Mocker  (1984)  looked  at  planning  in  terms  of  patterns of involvement. They derived four patterns from qualitative research on adult learning that can serve as a basis for organizing the circumstances that affect learning activities. Type I, which they defined as a single event with anticipated  learning,  is  where  the  environment  containing  learning resources governs the learning process  to a large degree. An example would be a new car owner being shown a video tape about and being  given  a brief  lesson related to operating the vehicle. Type II, a single event with unanticipated learning, is where learning grows out of observations of and contact  with a set of actual circumstances. For instance, a  new secretary sees an experienced colleague utilizing a different  word processing package than the one taught in business school. It seems to have some superior qualities. The colleague is asked to demonstrate its capabilities and to teach the fundamentals. The

## 108 Process and personal orientation

new secretary also takes the manual home and reads it until, finally, there is a great enough feeling of comfort to switch over to the new  software.

Type III, a series  of events with related learning, is where one learning experience naturally leads to another. Neal, one of our examples in Chapter 1, became  somewhat of  an expert on  alternative energy  sources utilizing primarily Type  III learning experiences.  Type  IV,  a series of events with unrelated  learning,  includes  a  number  of  different  learning  experiences which provide  considerable  background knowledge on a particular  topic. Mary from  Chapter  1 demonstrated Type IV learning. She gained most of her genealogical  skills over long periods of time, through various learning experiences -  many of which were mainly unrelated to each other.

Spear and Mocker  (1984:  8) point out  that more research is needed  to understand better "how the structure for learning is constructed and how and why  self-directed learners make their decisions  as their learning activities proceed". However, their current framework  on involvement patterns still provides  some  help  in understanding the  different  types  of  teaching  and learning that are possible.

The teaching and learning process we advocate in this book  encompasses most aspects of Stubblefield's four stage model. It also allows for the varied organizing  and  decision-making  circumstances  suggested  by  Spear  and Mocker, although Type IV learning usually occurs after more formal experiences take place. As Little (1985) notes, the strategies employed to learn in a self-directed manner will necessarily  vary as a function  of what is being learned.

Following, therefore, are some specific roles that we believe the  facilitator needs to undertake in promoting self-direction in learning;

- 1  Provide information on certain topics through lecturing and the use of media or other learning techniques;
- 2  Serve  as  a resource  for  an  individual or  for  a  small group on  certain portions of the learning content;
- 3  Assist learners to assess their needs and competencies so each person can map out an individual learning path;
- 4  Provide feedback on successive  drafts of each person*s learning plan or contract;
- 5  Locate available resources or secure new information on topics  identified through needs assessment;
- 6  Build a resource collection of information, media, and models related to a variety of topics or areas of study;
- 7  Arrange for contacts with resource people on special topics and set up learning  experiences for individuals and  small groups  beyond normal large group sessions;

## Facilitating self-directed learning 109

- 8 Work with learners outside of formal or group settings as a stimulator or sounding  board;
- 9  Help learners  develop  an attitude  about  and approach to learning  that fosters independence;
- 10 Promote  discussion,  raising  of  questions,  and  small  group  activity  to stimulate interest in the learning  experience;
- 11 Help develop apositive attitude  toward learning and self-directed inquiry;
- 12 Manage  a learning  process that  includes  such  activities  as  continuous diagnosis of needs, acquisition of continuous feedback, and fostering of learner involvement; and
- 13 Serve  as  a  validator  or  evaluator  of  learner accomplishment  both throughout and at the end of a learning  experience.

Thus, the interactive process that we advocate calls for an instructor to serve as facilitator and for learners to assume personal responsibility related to their own  achievements.  It  has  been  our  experience that  the  mature  learner flourishes in a setting where identification of needs, personal ownership of learning involvement, and use of a wide variety of available resources  are thoroughly and thoughtfully integrated into the instructional process.

## AN INTERACTIVE TEACHING AND LEARNING PROCESS

The process described  in this chapter has evolved through several  years of experimentation and feedback from learners, primarily in the graduate classroom with students majoring in adult education. Together  we have over 30 years of experience instructing adults in a wide variety of settings. This has included weekly classes, intensive summer classes, weekend classes,  independent study via learning contracts,  instruction via television,  tele-lecture, and computer conferencing software, workshops, conferences, and informal training sessions. We stress, however, that the ideas presented here are but a few  possible  strategies for facilitating self-directed learning.  Nonetheless, they are strategies that work for one or both of us.

We believe that  the process  can  work, with  various  modifications, in virtually  any  setting.  The  librarian,  for  example,  can  use  approaches  for determining needs and helping learners select learning resources  similar to those  we describe.  The County Extension  agent can incorporate  learners' experiences  and  needs  in  teaching  about  appropriate  pesticide  use.  The literacy  volunteer  can  adapt  variations  of  learning  contracts  for  helping learners make progress on reading and writing.

As noted earlier in this chapter, the andragogical teaching  and learning procedures  advocated  by Knowles (1980) have clearly influenced our approach. In addition, Knowles and Associates (1984) describe  adaptations of

## 110 Process and personal orientation

the andragogical process in various formal and informal settings. In Chapters 8 and 10 we also summarize some individualized approaches used in various settings  and with various groupings of people.  Understanding the influence of Knowles' work on us and studying all these variations will be useful  as you think about adaptations you can make to the process  we describe. We therefore present our process with the expectation that it will be necessary to make appropriate  adjustments that fit your personality,  preferred teaching techniques, and organizational requirements.

Finally, we must note that your teaching and learning philosophy, and the teaching style growing out of this philosophy, will impact on the adaptations you will make. Understanding and being able to delineate a personal philosophy promotes both the flexibility and consistency we believe is needed in working with adult learners. Hiemstra (1988b) provides some guidelines for thinking about personal philosophy and how that philosophy can be used to guide  action  within the classroom.  White and Brockett  (1987)  also  share some ideas about applying philosophy in an informal adult education setting. Hayes (1989) provides a wide range of insights relative to teaching style.

## Initial planning

One of the  first  things we usually do in preparing  for  a facilitator role  is develop what we call a "learning rationale" sheet. In this rationale  statement we go further  than simply developing  a description  of the learning  experience. We develop for learners a statement that describes some reasons why we  believe  they  will  be  interested  in  the  learning  experiences.  We  also describe  how we will work as instructors in the individualized  experience. Philosophically,  it  is not  our  intent  to manipulate learners  into following some preset direction, but we believe facilitators must constantly be diligent in  finding  an  appropriate  balance  between learner  freedom  and whatever organizational requirements  that might exist. Thus, in the rationale statement, we also include comments about self-direction in learning and what learners can expect from us.

Another preparation activity involves specifying necessary  competencies, learning requirements, and goals. In reality, most learners will expect you to put on an "expert" hat from time to time. In other words, as we noted  above, you need to make sure that the course  covers those  topics included  in the catalog description and curricular guide, or implied in the title.

Before  a learning  experience  actually begins,  it is important  to  design some  appropriate  needs-assessment  materials.  When  we  are  teaching  a formal  course,  for example, we normally use two needs-assessment  techniques.  The  first  technique  involves  written  responses by  learners  to  a needs-assessment tool. The second technique involves learners in some small

group discussions in which each person*  s  needs can be contrasted  with others in the group. This usually leads to more clearly defined personal needs and, frequently,  discovery of previously unrecognized  needs, More information on needs assessment is presented later in the chapter,

Another initial course-planning activity involves finding, building, designing,  and developing relevant support materials.  This  function  actually is ongoing, with new materials constantly being developed and old ones phased out as needed. It involves continuous reading and collecting materials related to  various  subjects  or  content  areas.  The  job  is  almost overwhelming, especially as one adds courses to a teaching repertoire.  However, the process is predicated  on a philosophy that places instructors  in the role of learning facilitators,  resource providers, and encouragers of as much self-direction  as is  possible in a  learner. Thus, we believe that an important part of the teaching process is providing a wide variety of learning materials to the learners.

One more activity we have often  found  quite helpful  both  to us and to learners  is the preparation of a workbook or study guide of supplemental materials  related  to  the  course.  This  includes  course  syllabus materials, descriptions of learning activities, bibliographic citations, learning contract forms,  any necessary descriptions  or instructions, and special  materials we think will be useful  to learners. In most instances,  we also provide material specific or supplemental to certain learning activities. There are two distinct advantages to creating your own workbook for a learning experience.  First, such an endeavor promotes  advance planning  and preparation  related  to a course or content area. Obviously, not everything can be prepared in advance if you plan to use needs-assessment  activities to determine specific learning requirements. However, after a course is taught once or twice you will have a fairly  good understanding of the core material that typically needs to be covered.

A second  advantage is that much of the material pertaining  to a course that normally is handed out in a piecemeal fashion, is distributed all at once. We often make arrangements with a local printing company to copy and bind all  the  material  within an attractive cover.  Then  the  workbook  is  sold  to learners  as a normal text requirement for the course.  Most  learners do not seem to object to the arrangement because the materials are bound  together and  most photocopying  processes result in material of a uniform quality. Such a  procedure potentially has a spin-off advantage  of saving the  institution some money and some secretarial  time. Even if such a workbook  or study guide  is  done  entirely  in-house,  it  has  proven  to  us  to  be  easier  than developing the materials from session to session.

## 112 Process and personal orientation

## Climate setting

Once the course is underway, there are several activities important in establishing apositive learning climate. This section's purpose is to describe these activities and to provide a picture of the approach used in those crucial  first few hours together. As Pratt (1984: 7) notes, "the first session can be critical to the eventual success of... [the course]".

In many learning experiences, the actual content acquisition begins within the first few minutes of the first session. In essence, many instructors assume that  each  student  is  there  with  textbooks  in hand,  an  appropriate  mental attitude in place,  and pencil poised  to receive  the "gospel".  Consequently, what often happens is that the "gospel" is given via a lecture that continues throughout the initial period. Any mention of assignments, expectations, and course  direction is made almost incidentally. Very often  learners  are even discouraged from talking with each other, seeking an understanding  of course goals, or asking questions.

We realize that a somewhat negative picture of teaching is being painted in the above paragraph. However, many of our graduate students report that they frequently experience something similar in many of their courses. Both authors  also  have  participated  in  training  experiences  in  which  we were subjected to a "fill in the empty reservoir"  approach.

We realize that most teachers or trainers are given the freedom  to make presentations  in whatever style or manner desired. However, based  on our teaching experiences, we contend that the independent, self-directed learner deserves and desires a different  approach. This is especially  true during the first  few hours together, when personal  attitudes about subject, instructor, teaching style, and learning activities are formed.

Some additional strategies we have used with success include the following:

- 1 Physical arrangements and personal comfort are important ingredients in successful teaching and learning. Plan ahead to make sure the  classroom or meeting place arrangements will meet the needs of the participants and your  learning  expectations.  Hiemstra and Sisco (1990),  Vosko  (1984, 1985) and Vosko and Hiemstra (1988) provide some ideas related to the physical setting and environment;
- 2  Arrive at the classroom setting early enough to ensure that the space is appropriately set up. This may include moving chairs, checking the room temperature, checking for  adequate lighting, arranging for any needed break-out areas for group discussion, and making sure all audio-visual equipment is in place and working;
- 3  Make provisions for coffee/tea, smoking, and toilet breaks, taking into account both those who may be very much opposed to smoking and those

who cannot go for long periods of not smoking without  it having an effect on their ability to learn.

## Helping learners become acquainted

There  are  a  number  of  techniques  that  we  use  to  help  learners  become acquainted  and to begin to feel comfortable in the learning setting. One of the first things we usually do is spend a very brief time  introducing ourselves. We then ask all participants  to fill  out one side of a card  with their name, address, and other useful  information. We note that the information will be used for a group roster so they can contact fellow  students outside of group meeting  times.  We  encourage  such  networking  for  purposes  of  raising questions, studying together, or working  jointly on course projects.

We then ask them to turn the card over, fold  it in half  so that the above information is on the inside, and make a tent card that will stand up by itself. They are then asked to print their first name, a nickname, or whatever name they would like to be called, in large block letters on both sides of the card. The instructor should make a tent card, too (we both prefer to use our  first names rather than titles or last names to help create  an informal climate). Such name cards are used for at least the first several group sessions to help in the learning of each others'  names.

Next, we have students introduce themselves. One technique  is to have the students turn to their closest partner and work in dyads. We ask them to spend about 15 minutes becoming acquainted. Then each partner in a dyad introduces the other to all group members and tells something  about each other's background. This provides a chance for participants to get to know another person and for remaining group members to learn something about everyone through the subsequent introductions.

If the group is not too large (probably no larger than sixteen people), or if several people  already know each other quite well, we ask partners to  find out and report  something unusual or special about each other.  If there are uneven numbers, a group of three can introduce one of the other two, or an instructor can participate in the activities to form  the last dyad. There  also will be occasions, such as in small seminars or training workshops, where stick-on, or pin-on, name-tags can be used so group members can read the names as they enter into personal conversations.

Such techniques may sound simplistic at first glance. However, we have found that they do a nice job of breaking the ice, setting a tone of informality and mutual respect, and helping people learn names. In addition, you as the instructor can learn some valuable things about members of the group.

We  also have found  it very important during the  first  session  to spend some  time talking  about  the  teaching  and  learning process  we  use.  The

## 114 Process and personal orientation

workbook of supplemental materials described  earlier contains  a write-up that both describes the process and the instructor's personal teaching philosophy.  Typically we  include  various  examples  of  how  the  process  is employed, how self-directed learning is encouraged, and how the instructor's role  as  facilitator  evolves  during  the  course.  Discussion and  answering questions about the process or course requirements can go on until students appear to have an understanding of the proposed process.

## Needs assessment

It is  our  premise that learners should become actively involved in determining specific needs around which subsequent learning activities are planned. This involvement usually takes place or at least is begun during the first  session. There are two aspects to the needs assessment process that we use.

## Individual  needs assessment

As noted earlier, we spend considerable  time before each  session  thinking through the probable topics of student  interest. The resulting needs-diagnosis form provides a starting point  for learners to assess individual ability and experience. Within the first 3 hours together (or as a take-home assignment in between the first and second sessions) learners are asked to  rate themselves on several competency areas listed on the form. We also encourage them to add other items that are not covered on the form but that they think should be included.

The point of this activity is to begin building personal responsibility for learning through a  process involving self-recognition of strengths and weaknesses. Thus, we ask them to look  at their own needs rather than  guessing what their needs might  be. In this way, our learners begin to see how a certain set of experiences can be used to fill in gaps or to enhance personal strengths.

If  it  is  impossible  to pre-design  an instrument, group  members can  be asked to list their learning expectations and personal needs, and/or to begin a  process  of  designing  learning  objectives.  In  one  graduate  course,  for example, a gaming and simulation device on community-needs analysis is employed  during the first  session  as a means of stimulating the students' awareness of what they do and do not know. In another course, a pre-test of knowledge most likely to be covered during the semester is administered as a means of stimulating thinking about the range of topic possibilities.

## Group activities

We also believe that it is very important to involve participants in group-

needs assessment. In our experience, hearing how others are both similar and dissimilar helps most individuals obtain a perspective on why certain topics should be covered  in formal group sessions, even if they do not meet every person's individual needs.

The technique that we use most often involves the formation of groups of five to eight people. This is usually done at the conclusion of the first session together or at the beginning of the second. If possible, we like to put together in  groups  people  who already have been  through courses  taught with the individualized process and people who have not. Frequently, people will be asked ahead of time (perhaps before the first session actually starts or during the first break) to serve as a leader for a small group.

Thus,  after  people have  had time to complete  an individual needsdiagnosis  form,  and  after  everyone  has  some  notions  about  the  range of possible  topics, we ask people  to move into a group setting. We often use a numbering technique to divide people  into groups, where we go around the room and each person  counts off in sequence  up to the number of groups desired.  Each person  who numbered themselves as a one  in the counting sequence goes into group number one, those numbered two would go into group number two, and so on. Sometimes we put up on a chalkboard  the names of individuals within  each group, or let learners form their own groups. If  possible,  we have extra rooms  available or we use  areas  like hallways, private offices,  or faculty lounges,  so that each group's discussion  will not be disruptive to other groups. We  either appoint a group leader and a  recorder or, more often,  ask that they be picked by the group.

The leader and group members are instructed to use the  needs-diagnosis form as a starting point, by ranking listed topics according to how each person rated a topic on the form and how much class time should be devoted to them. The process facilitates discussion of the various topics. It helps participants recognize  the  individual differences  within  the  group,  and  occasionally prompts a request for clarification from  the instructor. We make ourselves available as a resource but attempt to keep a low profile during the process. We want the students to struggle with the terms and language, to seek out clarification, and to realize that they will  need to spend time during the course on certain  topics.

We also encourage each group to determine whether there are additional topics that require some attention during future meetings. Each group is asked to supply a report that provides a  ranking of the topics, describes other topics needing attention, and seeks clarification of any concepts. We also encourage them to provide suggestions relative to teaching techniques, learning resources, and sequencing ideas. Typically each leader or recorder makes a brief report to the larger group so that everyone can see similarities or  differences among the various rankings.

## 116 Process and personal orientation

## Implementing self-directed learning

Designing  future  learning  activities  begins to take place  after  the  session devoted  to needs  diagnosis.  Using  the needs-assessment information,  the instructor builds a tentative group plan for the remainder of the course.  We do this by examining the various small group reports,  compiling a majority report  of needs,  and estimating the amount of time required  to cover  each topic. We also suggest the various resources  that can be used or developed.

Next we take a careful look at any requirements for the course to see how closely  they  match  the  compiled  needs  information.  This  is  where  the instructor's expertise  comes into play to be sure that students will finish the course with any basics necessary for subject mastery or to move on to a next level. Then we begin detailing activities for remaining sessions and pulling together resources  that will complement and supplement each group period.

The result is a plan of action for the course that is shown to learners for a final  review  and  approval  the  next  time they gather.  This  tentative plan typically  lays  out  a  weekly  schedule  of  learning  experiences, suggests appropriate  support  materials  and objectives,  and highlights  any required course  deadlines.  We  also  attempt to ensure  that the  weekly schedule  is flexible, contains slack time so particular topics can be explored in depth as interest dictates, and that time is allotted for what  Danis and Tremblay (1985: 142) call "reflective activity" and what Little (1985) would call primary and support learning  strategies.

Next, the  instructor tries  to bring  about  a logical  flow  of  events.  This includes securing the  necessary resources, arranging for any guest presenters, communicating the class  plan  to learners,  and rediagnosing learner needs whenever it is deemed necessary.  Rydell (1983)  provides  several ideas on how  to  develop  and  use  various  educational  materials  with self-directed learners.

The learners then develop a learning plan or contract through which they design an individualized approach to meeting identified needs. These plans typically  describe  personal goals,  resources to  be  employed,  learning strategies, evidence planned to show accomplishment, anticipated validation means, and time-frames for completing activities. Knowles (1986) presents a  variety  of  contracting  forms  that can  be  used.  The  instructor  provides feedback  and help in insuring  that a meaningful  and realistic  plan for the course is completed. Throughout the course, learners are urged to partake of group  activities  as appropriate  to  their  learning  plan.  Some  learners  will participate in every  remaining session. Others will  participate in only selected group  activities  and  use  time  away  from  class  to  pursue individualized learning activities.

During the remainder of such a course the instructor takes on two roles.

One is the management of each remaining session in such  a manner as to promote both learning and  involvement. We also support Brookfield's (1987) urging that a conscious effort to promote critical reflection by learners must be made so that all the intricacies of managing a process do not get in the way of promoting thinking, theory building, and intellectual transformation.

A second role involves one-to-one  communication with learners through written  feedback  and  individual  appointments,  renegotiation  of  learning plans as needs evolve, assistance  in securing  learning resources,  and evaluation of any products developed. Courses that meet daily (such as an intensive summer  session  workshop),  every  other  weekend,  or  electronically  will require some variations on those that meet weekly during a 15-week semester or a 10-week quarter.

## Evaluation activities

We use three means of evaluation during a graduate course to help us keep our teaching fresh  and to provide indications of how well the self-directed learning process  is working for participants. One involves formative evaluation throughout  the course. This includes being sensitive to non-verbal cues of  problems,  soliciting  written  feedback  occasionally,  employing  a midcourse  evaluation tool,  and encouraging  appointments  outside  of class  as concerns  or problems arise. Another technique is an instrument we employ during the last class  session.  It is designed to evaluate us as instructors  and facilitators  of self-directed  learning.  The third technique  is another  instrument  also  administered  at  the  end  of  the  course.  This  instrument  seeks evaluation of the process used, content  covered,  and resources employed during the course.

We ask learners to exclude their names on evaluation instruments unless they  want us to have  such  information.  Our  belief  is that  an  anonymous response is preferred by most people. Also, in our experience  most learners take these  evaluation assignments  quite seriously.  Consequently,  over  the past decade we have refined our process so that self-directed  learning skills are maximized for most learners.

## DEVELOPING SKILLS BY INDIVIDUAL CONTROL OF LEARNING VARIABLES

Within the confines of any formal  or individual learning experience,  there are several ways in which learners can maximize their self-directed learning skills. Borrowing from  work by Cooper (1980) and adapting material from Hiemstra (1988a), we suggest there are at least nine learning variables that can be controlled by learners. The extent to which control is shared between

## 118 Process and personal orientation

learner  and  facilitator  may  shift  from  time  to  time,  but  it  has  been  our experience  "that these variables are important to the overall  encouragement of self-directed learning" (Hiemstra, 1988a:  119).

- 1 Identification of learning needs As noted in the previous  section, we do some  initial  thinking  on  the  range  of  possible  topics  for  a  course  or learning experience. However,  once  the experience  begins, we use one or  more  techniques  that  enable  learners  to  identify  individual  needs associated  with the course topic and to begin taking that personal responsibility  that is so crucial  to the process.
- 2 Learning  goals Once needs have been identified,  specific  topics,  purposes, and goals should be chosen by the learner and incorporated  into a learning contract or plan. The facilitator and learner can then share in the refinement of this contract.
- 3 Expected  outcomes "The  nature  of  the  outcomes  desired  or  expected should be determined by the learner and tied back  to needs, topics, and purposes. The facilitator provides advice or offers  concrete  suggestions as needed" (Hiemstra, 1988a:  119).
- 4 Evaluation/validation  methods We encourage  learners  to select  evaluation  or  validation  methods  and  techniques  that  best  suit  their  own learning styles or preferences.  These  can range from traditional  tests to the  use  of  experts  or  advisors  completely  divorced  from  the  learning situation  to  serve  as  validators  or  evaluators.  The  latter  type  can  be encouraged  when  learning  topics  fall  outside  the  facilitator's area  of expertise.
- 5 Documentation methods We also encourage  learners to choose methods for  documenting and demonstrating accomplishments  in order  to keep records of what they have learned and to refer to them after the learning experiences have ended. Consequently, diaries, logs, journals, and scholarly  papers  are  often  chosen.  Christensen  (1981)  and  Progoff  (1975) provide some guidelines for developing and using diaries and journals.
- 6 Appropriate  learning  experiences Learners  are  encouraged  to  select learning experiences that suit their specific situations. A mini-internship in  a particular  adult education  organization  might  work  well  for  one person, whereas learning through reading or listening to audio tapes might suit another person. We also elicit feedback from learners in various ways to monitor the appropriateness  of various learning  experiences.
- 7 Variety  of learning resources To foster acceptance  of personal  responsibility for learning, we provide various resources from which a person can choose as personal needs and interests dictate. For example, in a typical graduate course we will provide: text recommendations; an instructordesigned study guide, or workbook, of supplemental materials;

bibliographic and library reading suggestions; media materials placed on reserve in the library; personal  materials to be loaned; lists  of outside resource specialists; and examples of student-generated  materials  from previous courses.

- 8 Optimal  learning environment The promotion of individualized learning includes providing an environment that stimulates learning  in various ways. Thus, throughout a course, we  provide a mixture of instructor  input, supplemental  learning  materials,  discussion  opportunities,  evaluation options,  and  mechanisms  for  critical  reflection  from  which  a  learner selects those aspects of personal value.
- 9 Learning  pace The self-directed learning  process  described in  this chapter allows for much of the learning pace to be determined  by the  learner. Given the existence of organizational constraints like designated  course time slots,  we encourage learners to select  a pace best  suited to their individual needs. In an institutionally sponsored course, this will require negotiations between the instructor and the learner relative to completion dates, evaluation techniques, and grading choices.

The learner can also control many aspects  of individualized learning activities outside the course parameters. We can thus:

encourage learners to seek ways of tying learning activities  to practical realities  of job,  home,  and  community. In  addition,  learners  have  the freedom to select a wide variety of written or media resources to enhance their intellectual growth related to the subject matter, especially once the course has been completed and subsequent application needs arise.

(Hiemstra, 1988a: 120)

## RESOURCES FOR SELF-DIRECTED LEARNING

As  noted  throughout this  chapter,  the  fostering  of  self-directed  learning requires that many resources be made available to learners. These resources frequently need to be made accessible during an entire learning experience because of varied learner needs, pacing requirements, and plans. This also means  there has  to  be  continuous  evaluation  of  resource  selections  and feedback by the facilitator. The final section of this chapter provides some thoughts regarding the types of resources that can be used for self-directed learning activities.

When looking in book  stores,  media catalogs,  and general  magazines, there are many resources which self-directed learners can use, including a multitude of do-it-yourself books, video tapes, and audio tapes. In addition, public agencies like libraries and adult learning centers have compiled many resources  on  a  variety  of  subjects  that  may  be  of  value  to  learners.

Unfortunately, from our viewpoint, there has not been much work to date in evaluating  the  effectiveness  of  these  resources.  Gross's  (1977)  book  on lifelong  learning,  Knowles's  (1975)  self-directed  learning  guide,  and  a sourcebook for independent  learners by Smith and Cunningham (1987) are examples of some efforts to provide resource suggestions. In most learning experiences,  however, the facilitator  still needs to play some sort of role in evaluating, locating, providing, and even creating learning resources.

A  group  of  people  thought  about  possible  resources  for  self-directed learners  during a workshop  on the topic  (Hiemstra,  1985c). Although the purpose was not to evaluate resources, a  classification scheme was developed to aid in the selection of  resources. Table 6.2 represents the range of potential resources identified. Such resources  only scratch the surface in  identifying possible aids or learning activities in support of self-directed activity. As you begin to use aspects of the  process described in this  chapter, you will no  doubt be able to add to the list those resources specific to your locations or teaching situations.

## CONCLUSION

This chapter has presented various examples and ideas related to the facili-

## Facilitating self-directed learning 121

tation of self-directed learning. Much of the individualized process elements described  have evolved from our own instructional experiences.  However, many  of  them  have  been  influenced  by  the  andragogical  teaching  and learning process, as well as several other ideas.

Obviously, we would like to be influential in helping you think about and alter your own approaches to instructing adults or we would not be writing this book. In reality, though, you will need to filter our thinking and instructional-process ideas  through  your  own  experience  base, philosophical beliefs,  and day-to-day instructional realities. We hope that our ideas and experiences and those described  in Hiemstra and Sisco (1990) will enhance your instructional skills and abilities.

## 7 Enhancing learner self-direction

In  the  "Personal  Responsibility  Orientation"  (PRO)  model,  self-directed learning  as  an instructional  method  is one  of  two key  components  in  the broader  concept  of self-direction  in learning.  This component,  which  was addressed in the previous  chapter,  stresses the processes occurring outside the individual that can facilitate greater self-direction.  The other key component of the PRO model is what we have referred to as  "learner self-direction." Here, the focus is on what is going on within the person and is perhaps  best understood  in terms of personality.  Another way of distinguishing  between these  two  components is  that  the  emphasis  of  self-directed learning  is external to the individual while the focus of learner self-direction is internal to the individual. In this chapter, we will shift our focus from  the external, process orientation to an examination of the internal, personal orientation.

It is our intention to explore  some of what we believe are key influences on the phenomenon  of learner  self-direction.  Further,  we  will address the interplay between influences on the individual learner and the social context in which self-direction develops. Finally, emphasis will shift  to an examination of three strategies that can be used by facilitators  to promote greater self-directedness  among adult learners.  A key  assumption  underlying the discussion in this chapter, as well as the PRO model in general, is our belief that  there  is  an  inseparable link  between  learner  self-direction  and  the development of human potential.  In other words, self-direction  in learning can  be  seen  as  a means,  or vehicle,  by  which  individuals  can  more  fully realize their greatest potential as human beings.

Why do we believe that personality is so vital to a clearer understanding of self-direction in learning? There are at least two reasons for this, First, as was pointed  out  in the  chapters  on research,  one  of  the  most  convincing findings  growing out of quantitative investigations on self-direction is the strong  link  between self-direction  and  self-concept.  For  purposes  of  this discussion, self-concept refers to how one is "seen, perceived, and experienced" by oneself (Fitts and Richard, 1971:3). Essentially, what much of the

research  shows is that a relationship  exists between  a positive  self-concept and the extent to which one subscribes to principles of  self-direction.

A second reason for stressing the importance of personality  can be found in clues emanating from research  on participation  in more formal adult and continuing  education  activities.  For instance,  Houle  (1961)  in his  classic study The Inquiring Mind, developed  a typology consisting  of three groups of learners: goal-oriented,  activity-oriented, and learning-oriented. The latter group, learning-oriented individuals, were those who chose to pursue learning for its own sake, believing  that such activity would help them to grow as individuals. More recently, Houle has stated that at the time he conducted his (1961) study, there was tacit acceptance  of "the  idea that men and women should  assume  responsibility  for  their  own  learning"  (Houle,  1988:  89). However, he also states that the major thrust of the literature during the 1960s was not on individuals,  but rather on "social actions and responses" (Houle, 1988:  89). In another study, Morstain and Smart (1974) derived six  major reasons for adult education participation from a factor analysis of Boshier's (1971) Educational  Participation Scale. Among the six factors identified was "cognitive  interest," which closely parallels Houle's learning-oriented individual. Indeed, as was noted in Chapter 4, Reynolds (1986) found  a strong link between cognitive interest and self-directed learning readiness.

Looking at the issue of participation from another angle, it is possible to gain insights based on studies of why adults do not participate  in adult and continuing  education  activities.  Cross  (1981)  has  identified  three  major categories of barriers to participation: situational, institutional, and dispositional. The last of these categories  is particularly relevant to our discussion. According  to  Cross,  dispositional barriers  are  "related  to  attitudes and self-perceptions  about oneself  as a learner"  (Cross,  1981: 98).  These  can include  such  concerns  as a belief  that one  is  "too  old"  to  learn,  lack of confidence,  previous negative experiences  in school,  and uncertainty/fear about what might result from participating in learning. What the various types of dispositional  barriers  share, though, is that they are based on beliefs that come from within the individual, based on personal perceptions  and/or past experiences.

More  recently,  Darkenwald  and  Valentine  (1985),  using  a  modified version of the Deterrents to Participation Scale (DPS) (Scanlan and Darkenwald,  1984), identified  six factors related to non-participation  in organized adult education courses  among a "general" adult population.  These factors include: lack of confidence, lack of course relevance, time constraints, low personal  priority, cost,  and  personal  problems.  Similarly,  Hayes  (1988) administered a modified  version of the DPS (DPS-LL) to a group of adult basic education students and found  five factors identified as deterrents: low self-confidence,  social disapproval, situational barriers, negative attitude to

## 124 Process and personal orientation

classes,  and low personal priority. While these more recent  studies utilized methodology  and  instrumentation  different  from  the  earlier  work,  there seems be a degree of overlap between the major sets of factors that appear to impact upon participation in formal adult education.

We believe that the research on participation and barriers to participation provide important insights relative to learner self-direction. Even though this work  has  largely  been  drawn  from  institutionally-based  adult education programs, the emphasis on attitudinal factors reinforces  the importance  of personality as a determinant of, or deterrent to, participation. By addressing these considerations, it might be possible  to increase participation  in adult learning. So, too, we believe will be the case when one chooses to engage in learning through a self-directed method. Let us now look at some of the ideas that have influenced the concept of learner self-direction.

## CONCEPTUAL INFLUENCES ON LEARNER SELF-DIRECTION

In Chapter 2, we pointed out that the idea of personal responsibility, which we view as central to the idea of self-direction in learning, is derived largely from  principles  of  humanistic  philosophy.  Similarly,  we  believe  that  an understanding of learner self-direction can best be gained from the humanist perspective. At  the  same time, other theories - namely behaviorist/neobehaviorist thought and  perspective  transformation/transformation  theory - can help to provide greater understanding of this personal orientation.  Each of these directions is considered  below.

## Humanist influences

Humanistic  philosophy  has  deep  roots  that  can  be  found  in  the ideas of Confucius, Greco-Roman philosophers  such as Aristotle, and many of those involved  in  the  Italian  Renaissance of  the  fifteenth century  (Elias  and Merriam, 1980). In the twentieth century, the humanistic viewpoint has been further developed by existentialist philosophers  such as Sartre.

Elias and Merriam (1980) have discussed  what they see as seven basic assumptions underlying humanistic philosophy. These  can be summarized as follows:

- 1  Human nature is inherently good;
- 2  Individuals are  free  and  autonomous  and,  thus,  "capable  of  making significant personal choices within the constraints imposed by heredity, personal history, and environment" (Elias and Merriam, 1980:  118).
- 3  Each person is a unique individual with unlimited potential for growth and development;

- 4  Self-concept  -  one's  subjective  perception  of self  -  is an important influence on growth and development;
- 5  Individuals  possess an urge toward self-actualization, the highest level  of personal growth;
- 6 Personally  defined realities play an especially important role in  humanistic thought; and
- 7  Individuals possess a sense of responsibility to themselves and others.

It should be clear that each of these principles is very much consistent with the values underlying the PRO model.

Within  the  field  of  psychology,  humanistic ideas  have  been  stressed through what is sometimes referred to as the "third  force"  in psychology (Goble,  1970).  This  third  force,  or  humanistic psychology,  grew out  of discontentment  with the  psychoanalytic  and  behavioristic  emphases  that have been predominant in twentieth-century  psychological thought. Perhaps the two individuals whose ideas have been most seminal to the development of humanistic psychology are Abraham Maslow and Carl Rogers.

Maslow (1970) is perhaps best known for his theory that human  motivation occurs according to a "hierarchy of needs." In this hierarchy, needs are arranged  in  the following order: physiological,  safety,  belongingness and love, esteem, and self-actualization.  The point that Maslow stresses is that since these needs are arranged hierarchically, one must be able to fulfill  the needs at a given level in order to work effectively  toward the fulfillment of needs at the next  highest level. For example, it will be necessary for a person seeking to fulfill belongingness  and love needs to first have met needs at the two previous levels.

What  is  crucial  about  Maslow's  work  to  our  discussion  of  learner self-direction is the concept of "self-actualization." This, according to Maslow, "may be loosely  described  as the full  use  and exploitation of  talents, capacities, potentialities,  etc."  (Maslow,  1970:  150). In other words, selfactualization refers to the highest level of human growth, where one  has reached one's fullest potential. As with self-direction, though, it is important to think of self-actualization  as an extreme on a continuum, an ideal state toward which one is continuously striving.

Maslow has also identified a number of characteristics  shared by selfactualizing people.  According  to Maslow, self-actualizers  tend to, among other things: possess a more efficient  view of reality and a  corresponding tolerance of ambiguity; be accepting of themselves and others; demonstrate spontaneous behavior that is in tune  with  their  own values and  not necessarily tied to the common beliefs and practices of the culture; focus on problems that lie outside of themselves, thus demonstrating a highly ethical  concern; maintain a few extremely close interpersonal relationships rather than seek

## 126 Process and personal orientation

out a large number of less intense  friendships;  and possess high  levels of creativity. Another characteristic, one that is especially  important in terms of learning,  is  what  Maslow  (1970)  has  referred  to  as  the  "mystic  or  peak experience."  Peak  experiences are extremely  intense  episodes  where  the individual is transformed through new insights. In describing  persons  who had reported peak experiences,  Maslow noted the following  observation:

There  were  the  same  feelings  of  limitless  horizons  opening  up  to  the vision, the feeling of being simultaneously more powerful and also more helpless than one ever was before, the feeling of great ecstasy and wonder and awe, the loss of placing in time and space with, finally, the conviction that something extremely important and valuable had happened,  so that the  subject  is to some extent  transformed  and strengthened  even  in his daily life by such  experiences.

(Maslow,  1970:  164)

While most learning activities are not of such an intense and insightful nature, peak  experience  is an important notion  for educators  to grasp  and, in our view, is potentially a key to understanding learner  self-direction.

Self-actualizers, then, are  people who  have  a  great deal of selfunderstanding and insight. They are creative individuals who are not  afraid to deal with unstructured situations or to march to the beat of the proverbial different  drummer. Self-actualized  individuals are consistently  working toward higher levels of personal  growth and, in doing  so, are able to utilize existing resources  to their greatest  potential.  In essence,  self-actualization, and the people who demonstrate high levels of this characteristic,  epitomize personal responsibility  -  as we have used the term within the context of the PRO model.

Rogers, through the approach that has been referred to as  "client-centered therapy"  (e.g.,  1951),  has  stressed  the  importance  of  the  client-therapist relationship and the need to shift responsibility  for growth in a therapeutic relationship  away  from  the  therapist  toward  the  client.  Through  such  an approach, Rogers expresses his belief in the potential of clients and his trust in their ability to assume responsibility  for their own lives.

According  to Rogers,  a major  goal  of  therapy is to help  clients  foster greater  self-direction.  He notes  that to  be  self-directing  "means  that  one chooses - and  then learns  from  the  consequences" (Rogers, 1961:171). This is the  essence  of  what  we  mean  by  the  term personal  responsibility throughout this book:  that learners  retain  control  over  their  learning  processes,  and  are  subsequently  responsible for  the  consequences  of  their learning.  To  expand  further  on  this  point,  Rogers  offers  the  following observation:

## Enhancing learner self-direction 127

The individual who sees himself and his situation clearly and who freely takes responsibility for that self and for that situation is a very different person from the one who is simply in the grip of outside circumstances. This difference shows up clearly in important aspects of his behavior.

(Rogers,  1983:  278)

Rogers (1969, 1983) has applied the principles of his therapeutic  approach to educational practice  and, as such, has helped build a foundation for the development of theory relative to self-direction in adult learning.

How might concepts from humanistic psychology translate into concepts of  learner  self-direction?  The study by Gibbons, et al (1980), which was discussed  in earlier chapters,  includes a list of fourteen principles, derived from research, that contribute  to a tentative theory of self-education.  These principles, are as follows:

- 1 Locus of control lies within the self-educator rather than in institutions;
- 2 The focus of self-education is on a very specific area rather than a broad one;
- 3  Self-education is undertaken for immediate application;
- 4  The self-educator is motivated by the desire to achieve in a given field;
- 5  Recognition and rewards -  a general  sense  of accomplishment - are important to the self-educator;
- 6  Previous experience, interests, and abilities contribute to the selection of one's chosen field of endeavor,
- 7  Self-educators draw from a wide variety of methods and techniques most compatible with their own style of learning;
- 8  "Self-education  involves  the  development  of  attributes  traditionally associated  with people  of character:  integrity, self-discipline,  perseverance, industriousness, altruism, sensitivity to others, and strong guiding principles" (Gibbons, etal, 1980: 54);
- 9  Such individuals  tend to develop independent, nonconformist, and creative attributes;
- 10  Reading and "other process skills'* are important to self-educators;
- 11 Experiences that  occur  in  youth contribute  to  an  eventual  conscious choice of what one focuses upon as a self-educator;
- 12 The  optimal environment for  self-education  is  one  that  is  warm and supportive, where there is a close relationship  with at least  one other individual;
- 13 Self-educators tend to possess good interpersonal relating skills and are often well liked by others;
- 14 The above characteristics correspond closely with those that comprise a "mature personality" and are associated with self-actualization.

## 128 Process and personal orientation

To summarize, our view of self-direction is largely framed within the context of humanistic thought. Notions relative to belief in a  positive view of human nature  and  the belief  that human potential  is virtually  unlimited  serve  as cornerstones  to the concept of personal responsibility, as we have used it throughout this book. Nonetheless, current thinking about self-direction has, indeed,  been  influenced  and  informed  by  other  perspectives.  Two  such perspectives are behaviorism and neobehaviorism, and transformation theory.

## Behaviorist and neobehaviorist  influences

Classic behaviorism suggests that human nature is neither inherently positive or negative but, rather, is shaped  by influences  from  the person's  environment.  Learning,  in  this  view,  emphasizes  the  attainment  of  measurable objectives,  which  are ideally  achieved  through  a systematic  instructional design process. While the assumptions underlying behaviorism depart from the  basic  humanistic  thought  from  which  the  PRO  model  is  derived, we nevertheless  believe  that  behaviorism  provides  some  insights  relative  to self-direction in adult learning. Two practices rooted in behaviorism that we find particularly valuable to self-direction  are (a) learning contracts and (b) a systematic instructional planning process. These  are discussed  elsewhere in the book, particularly in Chapter 6.

One example of this behaviorist perspective  on self-direction  is presented by Watson and Tharp (1985). In this view, self-direction is discussed as a set of skills related to the process of self-modification. According to Watson and Tharp,  self-modification is a change closely  linked to "adjustment."  Here, adjustment refers to harmony, both within the thoughts, actions, and feelings of  the  individual and between  the  self  and  the  environment.  Watson  and Tharp go on to describe a process  that individuals can utilize in modifying their behaviors toward the end of greater adjustment.

A variation on the theme of behaviorism has been presented by Penland (1981), who suggests that self-direction can be understood  from a neobehaviorist perspective. Neobehaviorism departs from classic behaviorism in that while  the  latter  is  concerned  exclusively  with  observable  behaviors,  the former acknowledges the importance of also understanding elements that are internal to the individual. Thus, whereas classical behaviorism is only concerned with the environment as a determinant of behavior,  neobehaviorism stresses the interaction of the individual and environment. This is not unlike the aspect of adjustment discussed by Watson and Tharp as harmony  between the self and the environment.

In  our  view,  it  is  this  link  between  the  self  and  the  environment that provides the strongest support for a behaviorist influence on self-direction. A purely humanistic view of self-direction looks only at factors internal to

## Enhancing learner self-direction 129

the individual. Yet it is clear that environment does play a role in self-direction. Certain teaching-learning transactions can  be seen to support or frustrate self-direction.  Similarly, there are certain sociocultural contexts where selfdirection is probably  more desirable  than others. The social context, which is a vital aspect of the PRO model, can be further understood  in terms of the next category of theoretical  influence.

## Transformation theory  influences

In  the  late  1970s,  Mezirow  (1978)  presented  his  notion  of  "perspective transformation" to the literature of adult education. This concept,  which had come out of several years of conceptual work (e.g., Mezirow, 1975) is based on the idea that, in adult development an essential kind of learning involves "how  we are caught up in our  own  history  and  are reliving  it** (Mezirow, 1978: 101).  Mezirow  goes  on  to  suggest  that  adults  "learn  to  become critically  aware  of  the  cultural  and  psychological  assumptions  that  have influenced  the way we see ourselves  and our relationships  and the way we pattern  our  lives*'  (Mezirow,  1978: 101).  Influenced  by  such  writers  as Habermas (1970,1971), Freire (1970), and Gould (1978), perspective  transformation  holds  that  learning  is  not  merely  the  accumulation of  new knowledge, which is added on to existing knowledge; rather, it is a process whereby many of the basic  values  and assumptions  under which a  person operates  are changed through the process of learning. Perspective  transformation is an emancipatory process (Mezirow, 1981) and is very much similar to "consciousness-raising.** And while it is a very personal  process,  it can clearly  be  linked  to  social  action. Mezirow  uses  such  examples  as  the women's  movement  and  the  civil  rights  movement,  where  the  goal  of learning is the empowerment of individuals, to illustrate how the transformation of individuals can subsequently be translated into social action.

How is perspective transformation related to self-direction in adult learning? First, Mezirow suggests that self-directed learning underlies the process of perspective transformation:

Enhancing the learner's ability for self-direction in learning  as a foundation for a distinctive philosophy of adult education has breadth and power. It represents the mode of learning characteristic of adulthood.

(Mezirow, 1981:21)

In order to enhance the ability of adults to function as self-directed learners, Mezirow offers the following guidelines:

- 1 progressively decrease the learner's dependency on the educator;
- 2 help the  learner understand how  to  use  learning resources - especially

## 130 Process and personal  orientation

- the experience of others, including the educator, and how to engage others in reciprocal  learning relationships;
- 3  assist the learner to define  his/her learning needs -  both in terms of immediate awareness and of understanding the cultural and psychological assumptions influencing his/her perceptions of needs;
- 4  assist  learners to assume increasing  responsibility  for defining their learning objectives, planning their own learning program and evaluating their progress;
- 5  organize  what  is  to  be  learned  in  relationship to  his/her  current personal problems, concerns and levels of understanding;
- 6  foster  learner decision making -  select  learner-relevant experiences which require choosing, expand the learner's range of options, facilitate taking the perspectives  of others  who have alternative ways of understanding;
- 7  encourage  the  use  of  criteria  for  judging  which  are  increasingly inclusive and differentiating  in awareness, self-reflexive and integrative of experience;
- 8  foster  a self-corrective reflexive  approach to learning -  to typifying and  labeling,  to perspective  taking  and  choosing,  and  to habits of learning and learning relationships;
- 9  facilitate problem posing  and problem  solving,  including  problems associated with  the  implementation  of  individual  and  collective action;  recognition  of relationship  between personal  problems  and public issues;
- 10 reinforce the  self-concept  of  the  learner  as  a  learner  and  doer  by providing for progressive mastery;  a supportive climate with feedback to encourage provisional efforts to change and to take risks; avoidance of competitive judgment of performance; appropriate  use of mutual support groups;
- 11 emphasize  experiential,  participative  and  projective  instructional methods; appropriate use of modeling and learning contracts;
- 12 make the moral distinction between helping  the learner understand his/her  full  range  of  choices  and  how  to  improve  the  quality of choosing vs. encouraging the learner to make a specific choice.

(Mezirow, 1981:22-3)

A second way in which perspective transformation and self-direction might be linked is that transformation theory attempts to bridge the personal and social dimensions  of learning. Thus, it can offer some insights into the "social context" dimension of the PRO model presented in Chapter 2. The  following section  offers  a  further  look  at the  linkage between individual and  social emphases in self-direction.

## THE DILEMMA OF SOCIAL CONTEXT

Historically,  one of the controversial issues that has pervaded  the field of adult  education  is the  question  of  whether  the primary  emphasis  of  adult education  activity should be on individual learners  or on the larger  society (e.g., Cotton,  1964; Elias and Merriam, 1980; McGinnis, 1981; Stubblefield, 198Ib). One school of thought  holds  that  the emphasis  should  be on the growth  and development  of  individuals  while  another  school  argues  that social change  should  be  the primary  function  of  adult education.  As  was noted  in  Chapter  Two,  this  issue  has  been  relevant  to  discussions of self-direction  in adult learning.  Indeed, some  of the strongest criticisms of work in this area to date have centered  on the belief  that such efforts  have failed  to consider the social context of  self-direction.

We believe  that the notion  of individual vs. social emphasis  is a false dichotomy. Instead, we share the view that both the individual and the social dimension are important and that one cannot exist without the other. At the same  time, given  that  we  are  working  largely  from  the  assumptions  of humanistic thought, it is our view that the individual is the starting point for adult education practice. Indeed, this point serves as a foundation underlying the  PRO  model,  and  the  extent  to  which  one  agrees  with  this  view  will probably influence the extent to which he or she is likely to support the model.

On what do we base this belief? A general basis for this view can be found in  Maslow's  (1970)  characteristics of  self-actualizing  people.  One  such characteristic  is  found  in  the  notion  of Gemeinschaftsgefuhl, which  was coined by Alfred  Adler (1939), and describes  self-actualizing  people in the following way:

They have for human beings in general a deep feeling of  identification, sympathy, and affection  in spite of the occasional anger, impatience,  or disgust described  below. Because  of this, they have a genuine  desire to help the human race. It is as if they were all members of a single  family. One's feelings toward his brothers  would be on the whole  affectionate, even if these brothers were foolish, weak, or even if they were sometimes nasty. They would still be more easily forgiven than  strangers.

(Maslow,  1970:  165)

While there is a certain condescending  tone in this quote that, taken out of context, does not seem entirely  consistent with basic tenets of humanism, the concern for humanity is nevertheless expressed.

Another characteristic  of self-actualizing  persons described  by Maslow that  may have relevance  for our discussion  is that  such  persons  reflect  a "democratic character structure." That is, they can relate well with people of diverse backgrounds and beliefs and, in fact, may seem oblivious to differen-

## 132 Process and personal orientation

ces  such  as race  or  class.  Further,  such  persons often  express  a sense  of humility that allows them to "learn from anybody who has something to teach them"  regardless  of  differences  between  the  individuals  (Maslow,  1970: 168).

While Maslow has addressed issues of social responsibility  and oppression in a very general, indirect way, Rogers (1977) has written directly on the theme.  Rogers  has  stated  that  his  "person-centered  approach," of  which self-direction is a key characteristic,  is very much parallel to the thinking of Freire (1970). While the contexts in which Rogers and Freire operate are  very different,  Rogers  found  himself  "open-mouthed  with astonishment"  at the similarities around which their works were built (Rogers, 1977:  106).

In  the years since Rogers  first  published  his  comparison  with Freire's ideas, these similarities  have been debated extensively - often with  Rogerians and those with a North American perspective supporting the similarities, and Freirians  and  those  with  a Third  World  orientation  disagreeing  with the similarities. O'Hara (1989) has offered  a synthesis of these arguments. For example, many Freirians are skeptical about psychology  and psychotherapy that  stress  the  individual to the exclusion  of the social context.  However, O'Hara suggests that the basic differences that do exist between Freire and Rogers can be resolved by understanding a single thread that runs throughout the work of both men:

Both unabashedly celebrate human existence and our evolutionary potential. They write of their fascination with human capacity for self-regulation,  self-understanding,  and transcendence.  Neither begs the intervention of a God, magic, manipulative technology,  or supernatural forces. They are both radical humanists.

(O'Hara, 1989:  13, authors' italics)

She goes on to state that neither Rogers nor Freire "gives up on people," and offers  the following conclusion:

What both Freire and Rogers offer us, separately and together, is the faith that truth both heals and emancipates, the uncompromisable position that we are all capable of becoming conscious, the conviction that we achieve only through dialogue with each other, and the hope  that through such dialogue, whenever, wherever, and however we have the opportunity, we can create a world  where every one of us may live in dignity  and may exercise our natural vocation to become ever more fully human.

(O'Hara, 1989: 33)

Finally, returning to the notion of transformation theory for just a moment, it  seems  clear  that  this  approach  offers  insights  relative  to  the  interplay between  individual and  social  dimensions.  As  we  interpret  perspective

transformation,  we see it as a very personal  process, which ultimately can lead to action in the social arena. Yet the approach is not without its critics. Collard and Law suggest that Mezirow's  work has been valuable in that by drawing  from  a  German  intellectual  tradition,  it  attempts  to  address  the atheoretical nature of North American adult education research. At the same time, they argue that the approach lacks the socio-political critique central to critical theory and does not address radical ideology. They conclude that "the essentially  liberal  democratic  character  of  Mezirow's  ideas  suppress  the concept of a  radical praxis" (Collard and Law, 1989:106). Mezirow responds by stating that social action  is only one goal of adult education  and that it, like other adult education goals such as intellectual development, self-actualization,  and human rights, is instrumental to the end of fostering "the conditions and abilities necessary  for an adult to understand his or her experience through free,  full  participation  in critical discourse" (Mezirow, 1989: 174).

The comparison between the ideas of Rogers and Freire and the critique of  transformation theory  illustrate  the  inevitable  dilemma  that  arises  in attempting to reconcile individual  growth and social change as goals for adult education, Clearly, this is not an either/or dichotomy. Nor can it adequately be  resolved  by  simply  concluding  that  "both  are  important."  Based  on evidence such as that presented throughout this section, it is our belief that the  individual should  be viewed as  the starting point for  adult education efforts,  and that an individual  who is able to strive toward greater realization of potential (i.e., relative to self-direction in learning) will also be increasingly  able to contribute to the creation  of a more just society,  where each person has the opportunity to maximize their potential.

## THREE STRATEGIES FOR ENHANCING LEARNER SELF-DIRECTION

The personal orientation of self-direction in learning, which we are referring to as "learner self-direction," involves a process of growth that takes place within the  individual, Can  the adult educator contribute  to  furthering  this growth process? Our response is a resounding "yes!" Just as the educator of adults  can  serve  as  a facilitator of  the  process  described  in  the  previous chapter, it is possible to help learners expand their potential by helping them discover that which is as yet untapped. This section will introduce three sets of strategies that educators can use in their efforts to help learners more fully realize  their  potential  for  self-direction.  The  strategies  to  be  considered include: facilitating critical reflection,  promoting rational thinking, and using helping skills in the facilitation process. Each of these strategies fit within

## 134 Process and personal orientation

the framework of the PRO model because they are aimed at helping  learners strive toward assuming greater personal  responsibility.

Before considering  these strategies, though, it is necessary  to set forth two important  points that  facilitators  need  to bear  in mind.  First,  the extent  to which educators can help enhance learner self-direction  is clearly linked with the degree of trust placed  in the learners.  Whether it is due to fear of losing control, or the belief that the experiences  that learners bring with them are of little  relevance,  the person  who is unable  or unwilling  to place trust in the learners or in the facilitation process is likely to have trouble fostering greater self-direction  among  the  learners.  On  the  other  hand,  the  facilitator  who views learners  more as partners in the process, with valuable insights and ideas to share,  will go much further  toward demonstrating  a basic sense of trust. This, in turn, should prove valuable in the facilitation  process.

A second point is that by modeling such behaviors,  a facilitator can help learners maximize their personal levels of self-direction. Just as we can be inspired by leaders from various walks of life who are models for values and behaviors  we  see  as desirable,  the  facilitator  who  can provide  a positive model of what it means to be self-directed serves as a first-hand example of unlocked potential. Such a person can thus serve as a  most important resource for  learners. The old adage "actions speak louder than words" clearly holds true in this instance.

## Facilitating critical  reflection

One  strategy  for  enhancing self-directedness  involves helping learners develop an ability to critically reflect on their experiences  to help them use the knowledge that has been gained in future actions.  Critical  reflection, as used here, is similar  to Mezirow's (1978) notion of not being trapped by one's past. More recently, Mezirow has used the term self-reflective learning to describe  a process  of "gaining  a clearer understanding of oneself  by identifying dependency-producing psychological  assumptions acquired earlier in life that have become dysfunctional in adulthood" (Mezirow, 1985: 20).

Closely linked to critical reflection is the idea of "critical thinking," which Brookfield (1987: 4) describes as occurring "whenever we question why we, or our partners, behave in certain  ways within relationships." Thus, when people  question  existing  ideas  or behaviors,  or  information  that has  been presented  to them, they are engaging in critical  thinking.  Four  components of critical  thinking  identified  by Brookfield  include:  identifying and  challenging assumptions; recognizing  the influence of context on thoughts and actions; considering  "alternatives to existing ways of thinking  and  living" (Brookfield,  1987: 8), and developing "reflective skepticism," an  unwilling-

## Enhancing learner self-direction 135

ness to accept a behavior  or an idea merely on the basis of having  "always been done that way" or "because an expert says it is so."

Taken  together,  critical  reflection  and  critical  thinking  are  important elements of learner self-direction  because  they involve  analysis  and judgment of  a problem  or situation.  In  other  words,  by  being  critical,  one  is demonstrating an unwillingness to accept "what is" as inevitable. By being critical,  one is thus able to assume personal  responsibility  for one's beliefs or actions rather than pass off such responsibility  to a source outside oneself.

Educators of adults can play a role in helping learners to develop critical reflection and  thinking  skills. Brookfield has  suggested  the  following strategies for facilitating critical  thinking:

- 1  Affirm  critical thinkers'  self-worth;
- 2 Listen attentively to critical  thinkers;
- 3  Show that you support critical thinkers'  efforts;
- 4  Reflect and mirror critical thinkers'  ideas and actions;
- 5  Motivate people to think critically;
- 6  Regularly evaluate progress;
- 7  Help critical thinkers create networks;
- 8  Be critical  teachers;
- 9  Make people aware of how they learn critical thinking;
- 10 Model critical thinking.

(Brookfield,  1987:71-88)

While readers may find many of these  strategies  to be self-explanatory  and self-evident, the strategies are worth noting here because  they are the kinds of ideas that can be easily taken for granted or overlooked  in efforts  to work with  learners.  Yet  so much of what goes  on in traditional education runs contrary to the development of critical  thought.

What are some ways through which critical reflection and thinking  skills can be nurtured? In discussing  ways through  which continuing  education practitioners can systematically analyze their practice, Apps (1985) suggests the following activities: reading, participating in the arts, thinking, writing, discussing, and acting. This same list could easily be applied in response  to the above question, For purposes of this discussion,  we would like to focus on two of these activities (which also happen  frequently  to incorporate  the other types of activities).

## Reading

As Apps (1985) suggests, reading is an obvious way in which one can gain new perspectives and, thus, be in a stronger position to reflect critically; yet, reading  is often  overlooked  because  time pressures  frequently keep many

## 136 Process and personal orientation

people  from reading beyond what seems essential just to stay on top of the activities  of  daily  living.  Some  types  of  reading  materials  that  can  be particularly  relevant  to  the  development  of  learner  self-direction  include general fiction and non-fiction, self-help materials, and biography.

General  fiction  and non-fiction  (and we are including poetry  and plays within this category) can help a person to gain a broader perspective  on the world. The person who is "well-read" has gained a vast array of insights and ideas  through reading,  which  should  be helpful  in allowing  the person  to identify  alternative perspectives to a given situation. For example, a person who has read widely on political and social issues is likely to be in a position to  understand  why  different  sides  have  emerged  with respect  to  a  given controversy, such  as abortion  or capital  punishment.  One who has had an opportunity to look at an issue from  various perspectives  should be able to advocate a particular position  with even greater strength. Here, the value of general reading is similar to the goal of traditional liberal education: development of persons  who are educated in the "broadest" sense  of the word (Elias and Merriam, 1980).

In recent years, perhaps no aspect  of the non-fiction market has grown more rapidly than self-help writing. One need  only  look  in virtually any bookstore  to see a major section devoted to such writings. The assumption in most self-help writing is that readers will be able to come away with new tools for improving their lives, whether by changing careers, losing weight, dealing  with  a difficult  relationship,  overcoming  substance  abuse, performing better in a sport or hobby, or understanding oneself in a new way. It is important to bear in mind  that self-help  materials are  not limited to the printed word: media such as audio and video tape are growing sources  of self-help material. While  the  quality of  self-help  materials  certainly  covers  a vast range, and while motives behind  the development of such works will also vary considerably, the self-help market would never have reached its current heights were it not for the belief  that many people do believe  themselves capable of making changes in their own lives.

Finally, biography can be a tool for critical reflection and thinking because it provides insights into the lives of other individuals. The study by Gibbons, et  al. (1980),  which was mentioned earlier,  shows how  it was possible to identify  and  understand  factors  that  helped  a  select  group  of  experts  to develop self-direction  within  their area of expertise. Through biography and autobiography, we can learn lessons and gain insights from  those who have gone before us. Biography can both inform and inspire.

To illustrate this point about how biography can be inspirational,  let us share an example from our own experience. During the development of the first  draft  of this chapter, the first  author found  himself faced with a  fairly strong case of "writers' block." This block occurred about the same time as

## Enhancing learner self-direction 137

several  other  factors  -  such  as new job responsibilities  and professional commitments,  the process of buying a house,  minor but distracting  health problems,  and periodic self-doubt  -  were going  on. During  this period, a journal  that  had  been  kept  by  John  Steinbeck  during  the  writing  of The Grapes  of  Wrath (Steinbeck,  1939)  was published  (DeMott,  1989).  In this journal,  Steinbeck  reveals the process and many struggles he went through in producing this most important work. The various entries revealed a writer facing numerous issues of daily living (including the  process of buying a  new house)  and expressions  of personal anguish about his ability to complete  a worthwhile piece of writing. Indeed, as he neared the end of the book,  the tone  of Steinbeck's entries  were characterized  by sheer determination and perseverance  on the one hand, and physical and emotional exhaustion on the other. While there is no presumption to compare  Steinbeck  with Brockett, reading the  journal was nevertheless inspiring and comforting; knowing that, despite the hurdles, both externally and internally imposed, Steinbeck  was able to persevere and make it through a difficult process. Through the words he shared in this journal, Steinbeck thus served as facilitator and role model, providing an excellent stimulus for personal reflection.

## Writing

The written word is an invaluable tool for critical reflection  and  thinking. The potential of reading has been addressed above; however, writing can be at least as valuable a tool as reading. For some people, this writing takes the form of publishing. However, some of the most valuable writing for personal insight comes through such activities as keeping a personal journal. Steinbeck's journal revealed a man who was able to use the personal journal as a means  of  critical  reflection.  Certainly,  many  of  the  insights  gained  by Steinbeck through his journal contributed, either directly or indirectly, to the final product as well as to his further development as a writer.

An approach that may have potential for enhancing learner self-direction is the "Intensive Journal" process created by Progoff  (1975). According to Progoff, this process "plays an active role in reconstructing a life, but it does so without imposing external categories or interpretations or theories on the individual's experience" (Progoff, 1975: 9). Thus, the process is therapeutic "not  by  striving  toward  therapy  but  by  providing  active  techniques  that enable  an individual to draw upon his inherent  resources  for becoming  a whole person" (Progoff,  1975: 9).

In the "Interactive Journal" process,  one engages in a dialectical movement that involves continuous shifting between externallyand internally-oriented reflections. For instance, on one occasion, a person may begin the journal entry by describing  an external event, then move into an

## 138 Process and personal orientation

analysis  of  what  that  experience  has  meant  personally.  At  other  times, internal reflection may be the point of departure, with subsequent discussion emphasizing  how insights  gained  from  this reflection  might be applied  in specific  external situations.

Like  the  first  author  using  reading,  the  second author  has  used  the interactive  journal  as a personal  means  for moving  his own thinking  and critical  reflection  on various  topics. For example,  a long-term  attempt  to understand more clearly the learning activities  of older adults was aided by a personal  journal  kept  during  an  initial  research  project  and  subsequent data-analysis  effort  (Hiemstra, 1975,1976b). The reflection that took place via this journal activity resulted in a case study of thirty older adults that has been  ongoing  since  1976  (Hiemstra,  1982a).  Both  of  us  also  encourage students to use the work of Christensen (1981) and Progoff (1975) as models for  recording personal  reflection  and understanding  within our courses  in adult education.

To summarize, critical reflection and thinking  are relevant strategies  for enhancing  learner  self-direction because  (1) they can lead  to greater  selfawareness  and  (2)  they  can  help  a person  recognize  alternative ways of thinking and acting that may not have been apparent prior to engaging in the process.  In either case, the end result is a person  who is better able to take personal responsibility in life, and indeed, in learning.

## Promoting rational  thinking

The notion of personal  responsibility  means that one assumes the primary decision-making role for one's life. It also means accepting responsibility for those decisions. Perhaps one of the greatest barriers to learner  self-direction, then, is the tendency among many of us to seek out external explanations for why the world is not going the way we would like it to be going. The  wife who attributes unhappiness in her marriage to her husband's unwillingness to act more as she would like him to act, the man who claims that his  inability to  read is due to an extremely negative second-grade teacher, and the  manager who is unwilling to change a seemingly outmoded policy  because  "we've always done it that way" exemplify three situations where individuals have not taken personal  responsibility.

Personal  responsibility is a choice: in any given situation, including the process of learning, individuals can choose how they wish to respond. At the other extreme, they can "cast their fate to the wind." That is, they can allow themselves to be controlled by the situation. A model that we believe holds much potential for enhancing learner self-direction can be found in the ideas underlying a therapeutic process known as "rational-emotive  therapy."

Rational-emotive therapy (RET) is an approach, first developed by Ellis

(1962,1973), that "places great emphasis on rational thinking and has as its primary  goal emotional change" (Wexler  and Wexler,  1980:  1), In  RET, humans are viewed as being in the center of their "own emotional fate" and, thus,  are  almost  fully  responsible for  choosing  or  choosing  not  to  make themselves "disturbed" (Ellis, 1973:4), Further, this "choice" is due in large part to the extent  to which the person holds rational or irrational beliefs  about events that have taken place. Ellis (1973) discusses his model as "the ABC's of RET," where: A = An activating event about which a person  becomes disturbed; B = The belief that the person  holds about the event; C = The emotional consequence of the beliefs (see also Wexler and Wexler,  1980).

Essentially,  what Ellis argues is that emotional consequences  (C), either positive  or negative, result not from  an event that has taken place (A), but rather, from  the beliefs (B) that the person  holds about the event. In other words, it is not the action itself that is responsible for "causing" the  disturbed feelings.  Instead,  it  is  a  series  of  irrational  beliefs  that  the  person  has constructed about the  event. These  irrational  beliefs  are expressed  in the messages that people tell themselves. These messages are liberally sprinkled with words such as "should" and "must,"  and a host of self-condemning statements.

To illustrate, take the case  of  a man who sought a promotion  and was denied by his supervisor. According to RET, the real distress that the person feels is not so much from the event itself as it is from  the beliefs the person holds about the event. If the man responds, for instance, with such statements as: "It's not/air," "I should have been given the promotion;" "Because I did not get the promotion, I'm a,failure in life," he is responding  with what Ellis would describe  as irrational  beliefs.  By contrast,  responses such  as "I am disappointed by the decision" and "It would have been nice had I received the promotion" are considered appropriate or rational. The point is that while we cannot always  control the events around us, we can control our responses to those events. And by doing so, we can choose to retain control of our lives. RET is an approach designed to help people replace irrational belief systems with more rational approaches to dealing with their lives.

Rational thinking, as addressed within the principles of RET, can be an important tool in enhancing learner self-direction, because it supports the link between self-direction and personal responsibility.  In discussing  selfdirection as a goal of the RET process, Ellis offers the following comment:

The healthy individual assumes  responsibility  for his  own  life,  is  able independently  to  work  out  most  of  his  problems,  and  while  at  times wanting or preferring the cooperation  and help of others, he does not need their support for his effectiveness or well-being.

(Ellis, 1973: 159)

## 140 Process and personal orientation

Ellis (1982) offers  further insights on his view of  self-direction:

most people - and especially those who  aim  for outstanding achievements -  highly prefer to  be  self-directed rather than strongly controlled either  by others or by external  situations.

(Ellis,  1982: 27)

And with regard to personal responsibility,  Wexler and Wexler (1980) point out that choices and decisions are a given of daily living and that what really matters "is taking personal  responsibility  for the decisions we make."

To our knowledge, the principles of RET have not to date been discussed within the context of self-direction in adult learning. We have introduced the possible linkage here with the hope that this can be an area worthy of further exploration. For those readers seeking a concise resource providing  further information  about  rational  thinking,  a  good  source  is A  New  Guide  to Rational Living (Ellis and Harper,  1975).

## Using helping skills to enhance learner self-direction

A final strategy to be considered  in this section  is of particular relevance to those who  seek to facilitate the development of increased learner self-direction. This strategy involves  the application  of basic helping  skills to the  learner-facilitator  relationship.  In  a previous  article,  Brockett  suggested that, in order to maximize the learning process, "it is important that the facilitator establish  an effective  helping relationship  with the  learner" (Brockett,  1983a: 7).  The  assumption  here  is that the  facilitator  of  selfdirected learning is in fact engaged in a helping process, in some ways not unlike that of a counselor,  social worker, or clergy member. The point is that there  are  certain  core  skills  that  such  helpers  can  use  to  enhance  their effectiveness.

Using the helping model proposed  by Egan (1975)  as the basis  for this discussion, several helping skills were divided according to three categories: attending,  responding,  and understanding.  More  recently,  however,  Egan (1986) has revised his model. In this section, we will look briefly at the skills essential to the application  of Egan's revised process model for systematic helping.

## Core values: Respect and genuineness

Egan's model is based on the premise that respect and genuineness must be present for there to be an effective  helping relationship. Respect, according to Egan (1986:  59) "means prizing others simply because  they are human beings." In other words, respect  is a nonjudgmental attitude where a facili-

## Enhancing learner self-direction 141

tator accepts the learner as a unique individual. Respect does not necessarily mean that the facilitator  must agree with the learner; it does mean that the facilitator accepts the learner despite these kinds of differences. This is what Rogers  (1961)  has  termed "unconditional positive  regard."  According  to Eg  an (1986), respect can be communicated through a number of actions. The following  list  has  been  adapted  from  Egan  (1986:  60-3) and  has  been translated into the facilitator-learner  process:

- 1  Being "for*' the learner;
- 2  Regard for the learner as a unique individual;
- 3  Regard for the self-determination of the learner;
- 4  Assuming the goodwill of the learners to want to learn;
- 5  Maintenance of confidentiality;
- 6  Attentive  physical presence;
- 7  Suspending critical judgment of the learner,
- 8  Communication of understanding;
- 9  Helping learners more effectively  draw from their own resources;
- 10 Expressing a reasonable degree of warmth; and
- 11 Being genuine in the learning  relationship.

Genuineness, the second core value, is simply "the quality of being oneself. The genuine helper does not need to hide behind a facade" in order to  feel acceptable to others (Brockett, 1983a: 8). By being genuine, a facilitator can communicate a sense of self-confidence and comfort to the learner, and thus, is modeling behaviors beneficial to learner self-direction. According to Egan (1986), genuineness has both positive and negative implications, as can be deduced from the following list of actions: refusing to overemphasize one's professional  role;  being  spontaneous,  but not haphazard,  in  relationships; being  assertive  without  being  aggressive;  remaining  open  and  avoiding defensiveness,  even  when  feeling  threatened;  being  consistent  between values and actions; and being willing to engage in self-disclosure when doing so is likely to be beneficial.

Respect and genuineness, according to Egan, form the core of a facilitative, helping relationship. In helping to promote greater self-direction among the learners with whom we work, these values can help to set a positive tone for greater  growth.

## Basic communication skills

Egan  (1986)  discusses  four  basic  communication  skills  essential  to  the helping process. These are: attending, listening, empathizing, and probing. Attending "involves  the  development of  both  physical  and  psychological presence or, in other words,  a sense of' being with' another person"  (Brockett,

## 142 Process and personal orientation

1983a: 8). At the most basic level, attending means paying attention to the person and demonstrating this to the person. Physical attending involves such behaviors as facing the individual squarely, adopting an open posture (arms and legs not crossed, for example), maintaining good eye contact, and being relaxed with these behaviors. Psychological  attending involves being aware of both the learner's verbal and nonverbal  behavior.

Closely related to attending is active listening, the second skill  identified by Egan. In the context of the helping relationship,  individuals are likely to share their experiences (i.e., what has happened to them),  their behaviors (i.e., what they do or do not do), and their effect  (i.e., the feelings and emotions that  grow  out  of  these  experiences  and  behaviors).  In  understanding  the self-directed  learning process as outlined  in the previous  chapter,  each of these perspectives are clearly relevant to the success of such efforts.  Listening, in this context, involves understanding the person's verbal communication.

As with listening,  the purpose  of empathy in communication  is to gain greater understanding. Empathy "involves getting a feel for the world of the other while maintaining a sense of objectivity" (Brockett, 1983a: 8). In other words, being empathic means that one is able to view the world from another person's point  of  view without feeling so "sympathetic"  that this understanding becomes distorted.

A fourth communication skill discussed by Egan is  probing. By probing, a facilitator can help one to explore oneself and one's situation even further. Such probes can include: statements intended to encourage  a person to talk further  and to clarify  what he/she is saying; questions  that can help one to either  elaborate  or become  more  specific  about something;  "accents" that highlight a key word or two of a person's statement about which the helper is  attempting  to  gain  a  greater  focus;  and  "minimal"  prompts  (such  as "uh-huh;" or nonverbal cues such as a nod of the head) that serve to reinforce the speaker or encourage further  exploration.

The value of the basic communication skills  mentioned above  may be self-evident; yet, these skills are so often absent from  our day-to-day interactions. For the person who  is  hoping to promote greater learner self-direction,  these  skills  can  help  to  foster  a  positive,  growth-oriented relationship. Further, if used appropriately, the skills should be able to help learners more clearly and confidently  explore their roles  as learners and, hence, to take increasingly greater personal responsibility for their learning.

## CONCLUSION

Essential to an understanding  of self-direction in adult learning is a recognition of those forces internal to the individual  that can help to foster a greater

## Enhancing  learner  self-direction 143

sense  of  personal  responsibility for  one's  life.  In  this  chapter,  we  have suggested that while self-direction is probably most consistent with the  basic tenets of humanistic thought, other systems of thinking about human behavior enter into a more comprehensive  understanding of self-direction.  We also stressed the importance of recognizing how social context impacts upon the way in which one operates. (To look at the individual independent of this context  would severely  limit our understanding of  self-direction.)  At the same time, we believe that the notion of learner self-direction  is vital, for it views  the  individual  as  the  starting  point  for  understanding  actions  and beliefs. Finally, while learner self-direction is an internal process  that ultimately must be chosen and acted upon by the individual,  we believe that there are strategies that facilitators can use to enhance  an individual's ability to maximize self-directedness.

## Part IV

## Fostering opportunities for self-direction  in adult learning

This part turns to notions regarding how  various  opportunities  for  selfdirection need to be fostered or addressed. Most facilitators of adult learning and, indeed, many adults will bump up against various barriers, dilemmas, or issues that inhibit self-direction or the taking of personal  responsibility. Four chapters are included that focus on some of the most important of these.

Chapter  8,  Institutional  Perspectives  on  Self-direction in Learning, describes how self-direction in learning  takes place in various institutional locations and how it is inhibited or limited in others. For example, a variety of  community  agencies  or  entities,  such  as  libraries  and  museums,  are described in terms of their potential for educational pursuits. Various educational  institutions  with  existing  programs  that  promote  self-direction  are detailed. The chapter also provides an analysis of the types of barriers that do exist which limit such learning.

The next chapter, 9, describes some of the policy issues that are associated with efforts  to foster self-directed learning.  An attempt to address  some of these issues through a  workshop involving adult learners is detailed. Fourteen policy recommendations centered around adults as learners, adult educators, and adult education agencies are included.

The tenth chapter focuses on an examination of self-direction in learning from a global perspective. Based on reviews of available literature or interviews with adult educators from countries  other than the United States, the self-directed  learning  situation  in  various  countries  around  the  world  is presented. The chapter  concludes with some recommendations on the further work  that  is  needed  to  obtain  a  more  thorough  understanding  of  global perspectives.

Chapter  11, Ethical Dilemmas in Self-Direction, focuses on an exploration  of  the  potential  ethical  dilemmas  or  conflicts  inherent  in  fostering self-direction.  The chapter starts with an overview of the current literature and thinking regarding ethics in adult education. It also includes the thinking that emanated from  a workshop that involved several adult learners. Several principles  were derived during the workshop.  The chapter  also  describes numerous ethical dilemmas and presents some ways of dealing with them.

## Institutional perspectives on self-direction in learning

Self-direction  in learning exists in a variety of settings.  For example, adult learning projects which involve considerable self-planning can occur among a wide variety of population sub-groups and in various situations.  We have also demonstrated in previous chapters how self-direction in learning can be facilitated even in fairly formal circumstances.  However, the willingness to accept this broader view varies considerably,  depending  on such factors as institutional mission or the philosophies  of individual administrators. Thus, the purpose  of this chapter is to demonstrate how self-direction  in learning takes  place  in various  institutional  locations.  To  do this  we  will  explore examples of selected institutions and will consider some of the barriers that can limit an institution's ability to support self-directed  learning.

Some argue that the learning that takes place in informal settings, without adequate guidance and support, is generally of little  value to society (Lawson, 1979; Little, 1979), Verner even went so far as to suggest that: "self-education is beyond the range of responsibility  of adult education, since it is an individual activity and affords no opportunity for an adult educator to exert influence on the learning process" (Verner, 1975: 31).

It also is argued by some that true self-direction in learning can only exist outside of formal organizations  or in isolation  from  some  adult education specialist.  Here, there is a belief that an institution and its employees cannot operate  without certain guiding policies and regulations  that affect  learning or  training.  In  addition, allowing  learners  to  operate  totally  on  their  own invites anarchy into the organization  sponsoring any learning  or providing facilities.  Some would also suggest that self-directed  learning  involvement would  be  inconsistent  with  the  structure  of  an  institutional  setting.  For example,  Little  (1979)  and Penland  (1981)  place  learning  in institutional settings only within a category dubbed "other directed  learning*'. In other words,  "true"  adult  self-directed  learning  occurs  outside  of  educational institutions. Finally, Spear and Mocker believe that self-directed  individuals "tend to select a course [of learning activity]  from limited alternatives  which

## 148 Fostering opportunities for self-direction

occur  fortuitously within  their  environment,  and  which  structures  their learning projects" (Spear and Mocker,  1984: 4).

However, the above assumptions are rooted in philosophical models that place teachers or authorities in positions of control or leadership. The basic philosophy  we share does not place teacher above learner or suggest that the adult  educator  must  have  a  critical influential  role.  We  believe that self-direction in learning is possible at any stage of a person's development and within almost any type of setting. Thus, although we demonstrated early in  the  book  how  many current notions about  self-directedness  stem  from learning  projects  research and  individuals  as  planners  of  their  learning (Tough,  1979),  Chapter 6 described  procedures  for facilitating learning in formal, group settings.

Mocker and Spear (1982)  identify  self-directed learning as one  of  four categories  on  a  matrix  of  lifelong  learning.  However,  we  described  in previous chapters our belief that self-direction is best viewed as a continuum, where  involvement is possible  at  any point  on  the continuum, from  very formal,  even  regimented,  settings  to  highly  informal,  non-institutional settings. Kasworm (1988a) and Brookfield (1986) are among those who also support this notion of a continuum.

Moore (1986) provides an example of personal, intentional changes made through individual learning  activities  that  take  place  among  inmates of a correctional institution. Garrison (1987) and Moore (1983) make the case for facilitating self-direction in distance-learning activities. Knowles  (1975) and Knowles and Associates (1984) suggest that self-directed activity is possible in any setting.

## ACTIVATING THE EDUCATIVE COMMUNITY

Activating community  resources for educational purposes assumes that most people and  agencies have the capacity - or  at  least potential - for  involvement in the educational processes necessary or desired in furthering human development.  We  suggest  that  these  persons  and  agencies should  assume considerable responsibility for the necessary  educational functions. In this view, the community can be seen as a continuous learning setting in which the attitudes, talents, and behaviors of people  are developed.

According to this view of education and learning, community resources are potential  learning forces and factors. There are a  number of organizations or agencies beyond the normal educational and social service ones that  have such potential: business and industry can  serve  as job-training  resources; churches can provide educational leadership on such issues  as family  life, human sexuality, and substance abuse; parks can serve as a learning resource related to physical fitness or outdoor education (Hiemstra,  1985a).  Stewart

(1985) suggests that daily newspapers and other print media can be used very effectively for adult education purposes. In fact, in the following sections we will  point  out  a  variety  of  community  resources  used  by self-directed learners.

The  connection  of  educative  community  ideas  to this  book  should  be evident. We believe that self-directed  learners can and do take advantage of a wide variety of community institutions to further their educational  needs. Brookfield (1985a) provided several examples of how self-directed  learning is carried  out in the community. Smith and Cunningham  (1987)  and Gross (1982) provide a variety of ideas, references,  and resources related to using community resources  for learning. The purpose  of this section is to provide three examples regarding what is being attempted and what is possible.

## Libraries

Libraries  are in a unique position in most communities  to assist adults in various  ways with their self-directed  learning  pursuits.  Burge  (1983)  and several colleagues point  out a variety of related  activities.  In reality, most libraries possess a multitude of learning resources, have access to many more resources through  various sharing networks, and are managed by professionals  who  have  information-searching  and  retrieval  skills.  The  continual increase in electronic access mechanisms and the growing number of specific adult education activities are creating  even more opportunities to meet the needs of users. Thus,  there typically exists  in most  communities a public library service  that provides support  for people to educate themselves continually (Conroy, 1981; Martin,  1972).

Public libraries have, in fact, supported  adult learning pursuits for many years. As J. C. Smith notes:

From its beginnings in the Nineteenth Century, the public library has been a source of information and assistance  for adults learning on their own... The adult education movement of the 1920's and 30's further spurred the interest  of  librarians in  adults who sought  self-education  or  who were reading with a purpose.

(Smith, 1986: 249)

A popular  service  that evolved  during this period  was  the  "Office of  the Reader's Advisor" at the New York Public Library (Flexner and Hopkins, 1941;  Monroe,  1963). The  Office  was  established  under  the  direction  of Jennie M. Flexner in  1928 and existed for some 20 years. Adults pursuing particular  learning  activities  were referred  to  the  Reader's  Advisor,  who would  interview  them, determine  specific  needs,  and  develop  a  tailored reading plan.

## 150 Fostering opportunities for self-direction

During the  1940s  and  1950s such  specific  services  were absorbed  into more generic services for adults, and interest in self-directed  learning did not resurface  on any large  scale  until  the  1970s brought  a special project  into existence:

Then, from  1972 to 1976,  the College  Board  sponsored  the Adult Independent  Learning  Project,  which  operated  in  several  public libraries throughout the United States. As part of this project, librarians were given special training, and, rechristened Learner's Advisors, served as learning facilitators for library  users.

(Smith, 1986:  249)

The  advisors  worked  with  interested  adults  for  weeks  or  even  months, helping them map out individualized  learning programs (Mavor, et a/., 1976); and, as Dale  (1979:  85) notes,  the service  was intended "for  self-directed adults who wished to study independently, outside the traditional education system*'.

The rediscovery of the value of providing consultation  for self-directed learners  raises  some  useful  questions  about  the  library  as  an  important resource  (Carr,  1980,  1983).  J. C. Smith found  that most librarians  share  a belief  that accurate,  effective  guidance  of learning  must be directed  by the learner. She suggests that librarians are in a unique position to be facilitators of self-directed  learning:

It  is  apparent  that  they  recognize  this,  take  it  seriously, and  through understanding bom of experience,  are usually good at it... to successfully facilitate self-directed learning is to allow it to be as individual a process as possible.

(Smith, 1986:  253)

What, then, are some likely future roles for the library? Obviously, technological  change,  financial  conditions,  and  the  professional  preparation  of future librarians are some important factors in determining just how successful  libraries will be in meeting  the needs of self-directed learners. One current project in New York State, begun through a Kellogg Foundation  grant and sponsored in  part  by  the  State  Education Department,  provides some glimpses into that possible  future. The development of Education Information Center (EIC) programs in several public libraries has resulted in several new features: (a) an information telephone service with experienced advisors providing resource ideas; (b) free half-hour advising appointments at selected community  centers  and  libraries;  (c)  community  workshops  on  specific educational  or  career  topics;  (d)  the  use  of  SIGI  (System  of  Interactive Guidance  and Information  -  a  computerized  information  and guidance program); (e) educational help columns in newspapers;  (f)  a  cable-access

television  series; (g)  an  outreach  program  to  various  target  population groups; and (h) considerable  cooperation between various community providers (Kordalewski, 1982).

Bundy (1977) describes  another project where certain  library storefront organizations provide information to learners outside the formal structure of a library building. Beyond the United States, S. M. Dale (1980) details some cooperative  efforts  taking  place  between  libraries  and  Open  University programs in the United Kingdom. Such innovations may well change the way libraries  think  of  their  programs  and  services  in  the  future.  Brookfield (1984a) even suggests that the public library is the most obvious community agency for assisting independent learners.

## Museums

A museum is  another institution where self-directed  learning  can  thrive. Gross (1982), for example, has documented various contributions made by cultural institutions to the work of self-directed learners. Obviously, a wide variety  of  such  settings  provide  unique  opportunities  for  learning.  Cansuggests several: museums,  zoos, parks, historical sites, aquariums, restored villages, botanical gardens, forest preserves, wildlife refuges, famous homes, and planetariums (Carr, 1985:51). Art galleries, science centers, archaeological digs, special  geological  conditions,  and theaters are some  of the other possibilities. However, in this section we focus on only one such  institution in pointing out some of the activities and potential.

Museums have been and are being used in various ways as a  community resource  available  for  the  support  of  adult  learning. However,  many museums still provide fairly  static "walk through but don't touch" exhibits or  displays.  In  fact,  adults do  not  appear  to place  museum displays and exhibits very high on their lists of frequently used learning materials (Hiemstra,  1975,  198Ib).  In  another  source,  one  of  us  has  raised  a number of questions that museum professionals must address in finding ways of better serving adult participants:

Do you just set up displays and let people  come  in and view? Do you become engaged with the learners in some way beyond the exhibits? Do you provide study guides for them? Do you train your docents to answer certain kinds of questions or to engage in dialogue? Do you give visitors handouts, as they come in, that provide organizing tools for their visit? Do you offer them hands-on opportunities?

(Hiemstra, 198  la: 65)

Questions such as these can help create greater awareness of the museum as a resource for self-directed learning.

## 152 Fostering opportunities for self-direction

Knox offers several guidelines for enabling museum visitors to engage in effective  learning  activities.  He suggests  (a) that visitors assume  the main responsibility  for deciding  what to learn  and how  (this  assumes  they will choose  according  to  their personal  values, purposes,  learning  styles, and pacing), (b) that visitors be encouraged to sequence their learning activities so they progress  from  an overview of major features of an exhibit to more detailed explorations, and (c) that visitors be assisted in  judging the value of their learning through such means as self-assessment inventories (pp. 106-7). He believes such assessment  tools will "help people become more self-directed" (Knox, 1981:107).

In reality, many museum educators understand quite well that if they are going  to  provide  an  effective  product  to  their  communities,  it  will  be necessary  to  think  of  visitors  as  learners  (Bertram,  1981; Bertram  and Sidford,  1977; Daniels,  1981; Horn, 1979). Many efforts have been made to provide new or special programs for adult learners:

Museum materials and staff  members have been used as supplemental resources for adult education classes at other locations; museum-related courses or lectures have been  given in  locations  other  than museums; weekend museum courses have included field visits and work at archaeological sites; antique  identification  courses have been taught  in  museums by  museum staff;  special  exhibits  or annual shows have been done on topics aimed at attracting new adult audiences, such as minority groups, blue-collar workers,  or the handicapped; traveling exhibits, loan exhibits, educational loan packets and tape or slide kits about museums have been provided  for use  in  adult  activities;  displays have been  set  up in  store fronts, shopping centers, zoos, libraries, etc., to promote special museum activities for family groups or other combined audiences; trained docents, volunteers and research assistants have worked extensively with educational  programming related to  adults; noon-hour  programs  or lectures (with or without lunch) have been held in and out of museums;  exhibits have been presented that have special  cultural or ethnic features; and a wide variety of media and materials (radio shows, TV shows, newspaper columns, supportive bibliographies) have been used as educational and promotional tools.

(Hiemstra, 198 la:  123)

For more extensive details of such programs and activities, see the works of Bestall (1970), Carr (1985), the Center for Museum  Education (1978), Chase (1978), Grabowski (1972), Heine (1977), and Wriston (1969).

Some special efforts  have taken place in several locations.  For example, in  1976  and  1977  selected  museums in  the  United  States  were awarded "Learning  Museum Program" grants from the National Endowment for the

## Institutional perspectives  on self-direction 153

Humanities.  A variety of activities were made available to interested  adults at such museums, including  lecture series, film series, special exhibits, and discussion groups. As Parks notes, a "learner's packet," consisting of lecture notes, bibliographic  information, film notes, guides to selected  portions of the  museums, and suggestions  for further  research  and independent study was produced "to encourage  use of the museum as a continuing resource" (Parks, 1981:208).

Another popular theme or concept used by some museum educators is the notion of "hands-on," interactive, or participatory learning experiences. For example,  at  the  Children's  Museum in  Boston,  exhibits  seek  to  promote self-experimentation  and  self-learning.  Museum officials try  to  create  an environment that accommodates many individual learning styles and speeds. Most adult visitors, therefore, gain new knowledge primarily through individual or small group activities.

The museum also makes a special effort to use such self-experimentation efforts  in helping adults (parents, teachers,  and others) become  better prepared  for  aiding  young people  in  learning  related  to  museum  resources. Gurian describes analogous museum objectives for such adults as follows:

- 1 Do their own learning about subjects they know little or nothing about.
- 2  Share with their children (a) those things they know more about than is apparent on the exhibit surface, and (b) what they have just learned themselves.
- 3  Add their own life experiences  to the information the museum provides and tell their children about those connections.
- 4  See  their children in a new light -  step back a moment and  watch their children learning in an entertaining and informal but still educational situation.
- 5  Observe  their  children with others  in  a nonthreatening, nongraded environment.
- 6  Gain ideas and materials they can use at home for family projects.
- 7  Feel free  to let their children go, so that each member of the  family can learn at his or her own pace.

(Gurian, 1981:279)

Museums appear to be on the  verge of  starting  many learning  opportunities for the self-directed learner. Certain policy and procedural  changes may be necessary for such opportunities to be universally accepted by both administrators  and  the  public.  For  example,  museum administrators  and educators must recognize the value of serving the adult participant. Some of the special projects noted in this section and others taking place are evidence that  such  changes  are evolving. Museums also need to do a better job of promoting themselves as a community learning resource center rather than

## 154 Fostering opportunities for self-direction

just  a  collection or  storage  site.  This  will  facilitate  (a)  learners  taking advantage  of  the  learning  possibilities,  and  (b)  resource  sharing  among museums and other cultural institutions in the community.

It is our hope that  professionals responsible for education in museums  will become better trained in adult education. Graduate programs of adult education throughout the world can provide specialized knowledge and training related to adults as self-directed learners. Similarly, conferences  and workshops provide a less intensive but nevertheless  valuable resource  for adult education-related professional development. We believe  that museum personnel could benefit from  such training and that the resultant programs and opportunities  would enhance the organization's place in the community.

## Self-help  efforts

The notion of grass-roots organizations  forming around specific needs has been  a reality in  the  United States  and most other  parts  of  the  world  for centuries. Biddle and Biddle (1965), McClusky (1960), and Warren (1979) provide  some  excellent discussions  of  self-help  efforts  at  the  local  level during the past  several decades.  In fact,  McClusky presented  an excellent synopsis of  several programs, including St.  Francis  Xavier University at Antigonish, Nova Scotia, the University of Wisconsin's successful Bureau of Community Development program, and similar efforts  at the University of Michigan, Southern Illinois University, Earlham College, and West Georgia  College (McClusky,  1960:  422-4).  Brookfield also  describes  the Antigonish movement, the Highlander Research and Education Center (formerly Highlander Folk School), and the Liverpool Education Priority Area project (Brookfield, 1984a: 106-24) as learner-centered, self-help organizations.

There are several more current self-help programs, many of which promote  self-directed learning  involvement  in  meeting  needs  at individual and/or  community levels.  Dean  and  Dowling  suggest  that  an  important outcome of such community development efforts  is the personal growth of participants:

The potential exists for people to become more self-directed  as learners, develop their communication skills, develop their ability to solve  problems,  increase  their  awareness  and  sensitivity  to  others,  acquire  new information about themselves, their community and others, and develop their self-confidence.

(Dean and Dowling, 1987: 82)

For example, the Citizen Involvement Training Project (CITP) as a project of  the  University  of  Massachusetts  Cooperative  Extension  Service,  is

## Institutional perspectives  on self-direction 155

designed to help people develop personal proficiencies related to  community involvement.  As Dale  points out, the project  has  taken  special  efforts  to promote self-directed learning:

One is to promote the concept of a within-group education coordinator  an  individual who  would  identify  needs,  locate  resources, coordinate individual and group activities, and perhaps actually  facilitate educational sessions  .... The other means by which CITP has promoted  self-directed or independent learning is by developing and publishing a set of manuals that present learning activities, work sheets, planning guides, background discussions, and annotated resource lists on the training issues that citizen groups most commonly raise.

(Dale, 1981:49-50)

As a second  example, Boggs describes  a project  in Michigan,  the Huron Agricultural Resources Tomorrow (HART), which used nonformal, selfdirected study techniques  in  helping community  members  deal  with waste-disposal problems and other issues. As Boggs notes:

Groups such as HART have arisen in opposition  to plans for hazardous waste disposal sites, nuclear power plants, commercial development of recreation  land, and so on. It is critical  to recognize  that while political agitation and the like may be endemic to their efforts, so too are collaborative self-education and community education.

(Boggs, 1986: 2)

In response to various needs  of self-help  groups  in the United States,  the National  Self-Help  Resource  Center  (NSHRC)  created  the  Community Resource Center (CRC) in 1974 (Briggs, 1981; Brookfield, 1984a). The CRC provided a mechanism for individuals and organizations  to network together in obtaining information and cooperation on various self-help efforts (Davis, 1974,  1976).  The  result has  been  a  resource  for  individuals  and  groups desiring  to  promote  change  primarily  through  their  own  initiatives  and without formal help from public  organizations.

Libraries, museums, and self-help activities serve as but a few examples of institutional resources  in a community that can play a role in serving the needs of self-directed learners. This, indeed, is what we mean by activating the learning community. It means, quite simply, that opportunities for selfdirection can be enhanced if the resources of a community can be mobilized in a way that allows facilitators to take a proactive approach in serving such learners.

## 156 Fostering opportunities for self-direction

## INSTITUTIONAL PROGRAMS BUILT ON SELF-DIRECTED LEARNING IDEAS

The  programs  described  above  reflect  educational  components of  what Darkenwald and Merriam (1982) refer to as "quasi-educational organizations,"  where  the educational  function  is  closely  related,  but  not  always central, to the mission of the organization. But what about institutions whose primary function is to provide educational opportunities within the structure of a formal organization?  Can self-direction  thrive in such  situations?

As  we have  stated  throughout  the  previous  chapters,  we  believe  that institutions have the capability  and, indeed, the obligation  to help  learners take  increasing  obligation  for  what  they  learn  and  how  they  learn  it.  If "lifelong learning" is to be more than a popular slogan or rallying cry, and if self-direction is truly to be viewed as part of lifelong learning, then it will be necessary  to stress the potential  for such activity within our formal  educational institutions. The following sections offer a glimpse of how elementary and secondary schools, colleges and universities, external degree programs, and various other providers can successfully incorporate  some of the principles  of  self-direction  in  learning  within  the  context  of  their  institutional mission.

## Elementary and secondary  education

As stated above, it is our belief  that the promotion  of self-directed, lifelong learning  must  begin  early  in  the  home,  and  be  reinforced  throughout  a person's elementary and secondary  schooling:

The very early years of life  are particularly  crucial  in the total span of human growth. This  is when the child  begins  to  acquire  the  ability  to mentally process and use information ... the parents will also be a very important factor in developing  a child's attitudes toward school, education, and lifelong learning. Education can be a very powerful instrument for  influencing  the  quality  of  a person's  total  life,  but  there  must  be continuity between what transpires in the home and what takes place in the school.

(Hiemstra, 1985a: 67)

What is begun in the home needs to be reinforced in the school setting:

Thus, learning  opportunities  provided  by schools to youth ... could  be developed  around stages of the human life cycle, around  contemporary social  issues,  and  around  the  promotion  of  future-relevant  behavioral skills. The ability to adapt to change is a  much needed skill in our society;

## Institutional perspectives  on self-direction 157

schools must  help  people acquire this skill through avariety of educational endeavors.

(Hiemstra, 1985a: 73)

Totten suggests further that teachers work with parents to encourage reading and study related to school activities as a  regular "part of  the family'  s  routine" (Totten, 1970:77). Knowles believes that the "primary mission of elementary and secondary schools would then be to develop the skills of self-directed learning"  (Knowles,  1984:  363).  For  example,  the  Bishop  Carroll  High School (1984) in Calgary (Canada) developed an individualized program for students.  Gibbons  and Phillips (1984) created  a "challenge education  program" that demonstrated  the ability  of students  in the younger  grades  to respond  to  self-directed  learning  activities.  The  Jefferson School-Based Management and Self-Directed Learner Project (Sanda, 1984) showed that self-direction can be nurtured in the younger years and maintained in later years. The success of such programs hopefully will prompt similar efforts in the  future.

At the forefront  of efforts  to apply self-direction concepts to the elementary and secondary school settings has been the work of Gibbons and Phillips (1979, 1982,1984). Essentially, they have argued that while self-education occurs outside of educational institutions, schools can provide  opportunities for  relevant skills to be taught, practiced,  and simulated. They suggest that some  of  the  major  factors  that  can  stifle  or  facilitate  opportunities for self-education include the following:

- 1 Control over the learning process;
- 2  Responsibility for initiating learning activities;
- 3 Type of management skills utilized by facilitators;
- 4  Knowledge of learning styles;
- 5  Nature of the purposes (content mastery vs. identified learner needs and interests);
- 6  Type of relationships promoted (dependence vs. independence);
- 7  Emphasis placed on subject matter or problem solving areas;
- 8  Distinctions  made  between  minimal  competence  and  proficiency  or excellence; and
- 9  Strategies used for evaluating outcomes.

Gibbons  and Phillips  (1982)  have  discussed  a  four-stage process  for helping children and adolescents  move from an authority-directed approach to greater self-direction  as learners.  During the pre-school years, the  first stage  influential parenthood -  involves parents  modeling  self-directed learning and providing an environment that fosters initiative and increasing responsibility by children. Initiative training, the second stage, occurs during

## 158 Fostering opportunities for self-direction

the elementary years and stresses  the development of individual and group projects by students in areas of personal interest. This approach is designed to change "the  child's habit  of learning  casually  through play  to a selfconscious, intentional  effort  to learn through planned  activities"  (Gibbons and Phillips,  1982:  81). At the secondary  level,  students  are challenged  to excel  within interest  areas.  In this stage,  which Gibbons and Phillips  call challenge  education, learners  meet  with  a  planning  committee  (usually including a teacher and parent), design a learning contract, and determine outcomes  that measure  achievement  of  a negotiated  goal.  Finally,  as the transition to adulthood is made, "the most valuable community contribution to self-education will  be  the organization of  learning services - opportunities, consultants,  resources,  and  facilities"  (Gibbons  and  Phillips, 1982:  84). These self-education  services are  not unlike the learning community concept that we advocated earlier in this chapter.

Hamm, in response  to Gibbons  and Phillips,  has argued that the above techniques have limitations  because of (a) confusion over the meaning of the concepts, (b) "false empirical assumptions and an inadequate conception of education,"  and  (c)  a  possible  "radical"  impact  on  schools  and  society (Hamm, 1982:87). In essence, Hamm is arguing that, in order to gain control over oneself, it is necessary to go through a long, painful process of gaining knowledge through discipline. While we agree that learning is sometimes a long  and painful  process,  and that this can in fact  be an important part of maturation, we remain  convinced that the development of a desire and  ability to accept personal  responsibility  for learning  clearly outweighs the  above limitations. Self-direction as a way of life necessitates  the fostering of such attitudes  and  the  development  of  relevant  skills  throughout  the entire lifespan.

## Colleges and universities

While the promotion of self-direction in learning is not overtly emphasized much in elementary  or secondary schools, for many years there have existed special university programs designed for those people who thrive on  individualized  instruction or  independent  study. In  the  United  States,  Antioch College's  work-study  program, Goddard  College's  adult degree program, and  the  independent-study degree  programs  of  such  institutions  as  the University of Nebraska were among efforts to provide individualized study opportunities during the 1950s,  1960s, and  1970s (Dressel  and Thompson, 1973; Vermilye, 1976). Such programs were characterized by the following: (a)  active  rather  than  passive  learners;  (b)  explicit  learning  goals;  (c)  a preference  for  small  lesson  units, each  dealing  with a single  concept;  (d) adequate feedback and evaluation; and (e) learner control  over the pace of

the presentation (Cross, 1977). A  variety of teaching and  learning approaches were used, including programmed learning, computer-assisted  instruction, computer-managed instruction, self-paced modules,  audiovisual tutorial  kits, community internships, independent study, and many other forms of selfdirected learning (Dressel and Thompson,  1973).

Community  colleges,  too,  have  long  attempted to  meet  the  needs of self-directed learners, as well as provide college transfer  programs (Kerwin, 1984). Gleazer suggests that the aim of the community  college is "to develop a  community  of  learners.  The  qualities  sought  are  independence, selfreliance, and  cooperation, not a  condition of dependency  upon an  educational monopoly" (Gleazer, 1980:88). Hunter  (1971) examined  community college students and determined that they benefited from  an experimental program of self-directed learning.

Finally, what Apps (1981: 11) calls a "quiet revolution" is taking place throughout the United States and in most other parts of the world, too. As Knowles (1984: 59) notes: "We have shifted  from  a youth-centered to an adult-centered society with drastic implications for our whole educational enterprise."  This change is reflected by the return  of thousands of older  adults to  college campuses. A  recent National Center for Education Statistics (1989) report revealed that  a  2.5  percent increase in college enrollments in 1988 over 1987 was driven mainly by sharp increases in the number of adult  students 25 years and older.

Such people are enrolling in undergraduate  programs, graduate  programs, and various non-traditional programs (Coe, et a/., 1984). The result  has been changes  in  traditional  programs  and  the  development  of  new  programs (Bloch,  1984;  Boud and Prosser,  1984;  Eldred, 1984;  Farquharson,  1984; Kilpatrick, et a/.,  1984; Loacker and Doherty,  1984; Schuttenberg,  1984). Hesburgh et a/., (1973) describe some of the necessary changes, such as new admission and  registration procedures, new orientation programs, and special support services for adult students. New ways of determining educational achievement,  such  as  credit  for past  experience,  credit  granting through examination, and bachelor- or masters-level  general-studies degrees have developed.

Unfortunately, the response of higher education to this revolution has not been rapid:  "It is  perhaps a  sad commentary that, of all our social institutions, colleges and universities have been among the slowest to respond to adult learners"  (Knowles,  1984:  100).  Hopefully, the  types of  changes begun recently will multiply in scope and number.

## External degree programs

External degree programs for college credit utilize a multitude  of resources

## 160 Fostering opportunities for self-direction

or settings to enhance individualized programs of study (Houle, 1973). Much of this learning does not take place in any traditional form of a classroom or university setting. As Wedemeyer (1981), in a discussion of non-traditional degree programs, noted: "more learning and teaching go on throughout  life outside the classroom than in" (p. 30). Below, we describe various non-traditional or external degree activities, most of which happen to be  associated with universities.

Perhaps the most widely known of all such efforts  has been the  concept of the Open University (OU) which originally started in 1970 in Britain and has now spread to several other countries.  Harrington describes the learning approach of the British OU as follows:

The heart  of  the  work is in correspondence  study, which  explains  the change of name from the originally planned University of the Air. Regularly scheduled radio and television lectures,  outside reading, and home experiments  round  out  the  program  ....  Even  though  emphasis  is  on individual  study,  students  are  brought  together  on  occasion,  usually during the summer, for residential seminars. In addition, there are regional centers where students can consult  reference books,  obtain  tutorial and counseling help, and study.

(Harrington, 1977: 60)

A variety of similar efforts  have developed in the United States,  as well as in other countries, for example: (a) The University of Mid-America centered at  the  University  of  Nebraska,  a home  study effort  involving  television, lesson  material printed in newspapers,  learning  centers  staffed  with tutors, and  correspondence courses;  (b)  The  New  York  State  Regents  External Degree Program, or the Thomas Edison College in New Jersey, which permit learners to earn degrees through credit by examination, credit for life experiences,  and  formal  college  credit (Apps,  1981;  Darkenwald  and Merriam, 1982).

One of the more widely known credit granting organizations  based  on self-directed  study  is the Empire  State  College  of New York. Founded in 1971 by the State University's Board of Trustees, the organization  is headquartered in Saratoga Springs with learning centers located around the state. As  Knowles  (1986)  notes,  it  awards  associate,  bachelor's,  and  master's degrees  based  on learning that can occur in a variety of ways: (a)  formal courses offered by a  variety of cooperating  institutions; (b) cooperative  study involving several students working collaboratively; (c) tutorials; (d) self-instructional programs; (e) direct experience  involving self-examination and reflection;  and  (f)  independent  study  by  reading,  writing, travel, or  other means. A learning contract developed by the learner and a resulting  portfolio

of  achievements  serves  as  the  evaluation  and  validation  of  course  work completed toward the degree.

Finally,  the  newest  efforts  at nontraditional  degree  or  study  programs involve the development of distance learning through various technologically-assisted delivery  modes.  Television and  satellite transmissions,  electronic  networks, and teleconferencing  are some of the forms being developed through experimentation. It is not yet clear how such efforts will assist the self-directed learner, but, as Garrison notes:

Adult educators must recognize  the ability of telecommunications  and microprocessor technology to assist adult educators to reach out to adult learners in  a variety of  settings,  and we must bridge  the  gap between formal institutional  education  and activities  of self-directed  learning  in the natural societal setting.

(Garrison,  1987:316)

## Non-traditional approaches to graduate education

The  idea  of  nontraditional  degree  programming  has  not  been  limited  to undergraduate areas. Indeed, it has been our experience that graduate education  presents  an  ideal  context  for  putting  into  practice  the  concepts  of self-direction  in  learning.  Graduate  students,  particularly  in  professional fields, are frequently mature adults who bring an array of experiences  to the graduate classroom. Furthermore, a great many graduate students choose to pursue their degrees on a part-time basis, balancing study with employment and family responsibilities.  For many such individuals, these responsibilities preclude pursuing a degree in a traditional format with such requirements as a period  of residency.  In order to illustrate  the potential  of nontraditional approaches  to graduate study, we would like  to present  examples of two programs  in  the  field  of  adult education.  These  programs  are  models of innovative, high-quality alternatives that reflect the application  of self-directed  learning concepts. One is the AEGIS program  at Teachers College, Columbia University,  and  the  other  is  the  Weekend  Scholar  program  at Syracuse University.

## AEGIS

The  Adult  Education Guided Independent  Study Program  (AEGIS)  is an alternative doctoral program offered by the Department of Higher and Adult Education at Teachers  College, Columbia University. Established  in 1981, the program is designed for:

senior professionals with substantial experience in  program development,

## 162 Fostering opportunities for self-direction

administration  of  continuing  education,  staff  development,  or  training who wish to earn a doctorate  in two or three years ... without having to relinquish  their  full-time  employment  or  change  locations  in  order  to attend.

(Bauer, 1985: 41)

The program consists of 2 academic  years of course  work, comprised  of monthly  day-long  meetings,  independent  work  on  course  requirements between sessions,  and advising with faculty  members (most frequently  by telephone  or  mail).  In  addition, participants  are  expected  to  complete  a 3-week intensive session  during two consecutive  summers. Through  such aspects as the accelerated  format, the use of learning contracts  within each course,  and  a  pass/fail  grading  format  that  emphasizes  revision  until  a learning  activity  has  been  "successfully"  completed,  the  program offers opportunities for learners to assume a high level of responsibility  for their programs.

Some of the challenges that arise in the operation  of the AEGIS program include  dealing  with different  levels  of  self-directedness  among  learners, recognizing various institutional and  program constraints that place limits on the extent of self-directedness truly possible in the program, and considering the impact of this format on the professional  (and personal)  lives of faculty members. With regard to the last concern, Bauer (1986), based on a 3-year case study of the AEGIS program, concluded:

Because of the intensity of the personal professional commitment necessary  in  innovative  program  development,  institutions  must  provide stronger support to faculty in substantive areas of tenure criteria, monetary reward  for  involvement  of  this  kind,  and  adjustment of  teaching  and administrative load.

(Bauer, 1985: 2518-A)

In  spite  of  such  concerns,  the  AEGIS  program  has  been  a  success,  as measured by its longevity as well as by the number and accomplishments of its graduates.

## Weekend scholar

A second illustration of nontraditional graduate study in adult education can be found  in the Weekend Scholar program,  which has been in operation at Syracuse University since September,  1982.  While the AEGIS program is limited to doctoral study and stresses  independent study, Weekend  Scholar emphasizes master's degree study (though doctoral  or other advanced students are able to complete a sizable portion of their course requirements in

this format)  and is essentially an adaptation of the existing  curriculum to a weekend format, thus making graduate study possible for students who are unable to attend late afternoon and evening courses on campus. As described elsewhere:

The program involves the completion  of 30 semester  credits  comprised of  10, three-credit courses. Each course meets four times, roughly every other weekend, with class sessions running from Friday evening until late Saturday afternoon. Two courses are offered  back-to-back  in a semester, giving students a 'typical' part-time load  of six credits per semester. In addition, each student is required to write a comprehensive  examination upon completion of all coursework. Quality is stressed in that all teaching and  advising  is  done  by  regular  members  of  the  Syracuse  University faculty  and  students are  expected  to  fulfill all  university,  school,  and department-wide requirements. An ongoing  evaluation process helps to ensure  that  the  program  is  effectively  serving  the  needs  of  the  target audiences while maintaining high quality.

(Brockett, 1988a: 289)

The program has been offered  in several locations throughout the northern portion of New York State, Students  come from New York State and Ontario, Canada. Although students typically meet in group settings throughout most of the course, the use of learning contracts and individualized study promotes considerable  self-directed learning. Currently, a distance education component  is  being  developed  that  will  use  computer-mediated  instruction  to supplement  group  meetings.  Overall,  the  program  has  been  an  effective vehicle for providing educational opportunities to people not able to participate in campus-based  offerings.

## Other institutional applications of self-directed  learning

The use of self-directed learning approaches  and concepts in a wide variety of  agencies  and  organizations  has  been  increasing  in  recent  years.  For example, several authors describe how self-directed learning principles have been used throughout  the health professions to affect basic training, graduate training,  continuing  education,  and  staff  development  efforts  (American Nurses'  Association,  1984;  Arms et  al., 1984;  Ash,  1985;  Dare,  1984; Neufeld  and Barrows, 1984; University of Southern California,  1984).  As Ash notes:

The very nature of the way in which professionals, such as physicians and nurses, function and the lives they affect as aresult of their practice require them to  possess a high  degree of competence. Self-directed or autonomous

## 164 Fostering opportunities for self-direction

learning must often be relied on in the development of such competence because  of  the  differences in  the  needs  of  individual practitioners  for information  and  in the  time frame  in  which  such  information  must be obtained.

(Ash, 1985: 63)

Ash goes  on  to  describe  how  self-directed  learning  strategies  have  been applied at the Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York City. Nurses are encouraged to use self-directed learning strategies  and resources in their job orientation efforts.  Most formal lecture presentations  used in the past have been replaced by self-instructional modules, a variety of reference materials, performance checklists,  selected resources,  and individuals as resources:

The learner's time is divided  between acquiring information and applying that information in the clinical area. Blocks of self-directed learning time included  in  the  program  schedule  allow  learners  to  select  one  of  the content areas to complete; learners may also choose to spend the time in some other way.

(Ash, 1985: 68)

Self-directed  learning techniques also are being introduced in business and industry  (Green,  1984;  Lloyds Bank,  1984;  Margolis,  1984;  Sinclair  and Skerman,  1984;  Sullivan, 1984).  One  study (Rymell and Newsom,  1981) involved an examination of the learning projects of a group of engineers in an aerospace industry.  Using Tough's (1979) learning-project procedure, the authors determined that, in at least this setting,  the employees  engaged in significant job-related self-directed  learning. In another study of managers and  non-managers  from  a  large  utility  company  who  had  worked  independently on learning activities, Guglielmino and Guglielmino (1983) used the  Self-Directed Learning  Readiness  Scale  (SDLRS)  and  found  that  the subjects scored considerably higher on the scale than other adult populations previously tested.

Some organizations have also begun to implement self-directed learning approaches in their training  efforts:

IBM's Santa  Teresa Laboratory  has  included  an  Information/ Library/Learning Center since 1975. The center is designed to serve 2,000 computer programmers involved in developmental  and design work. It includes  all  of  the  self-educational  resources  of  all  divisions  of  the company as well as commercially produced self-study materials  relevant to its users.

(Guglielmino and Guglielmino, 1988: 145)

A similar center exists at the SUNOCO headquarters in Radner, Pennsylva-

nia,  suggesting  that  business  and  industry  will  use  self-directed  learning increasingly  in their future training  endeavors.

## Technology and self-direction

The  number  and  type  of  resources  available  to  educators  of  adults  are growing  at an  astounding  rate,  primarily  because  technological  developments  have  speeded the  process of accumulating and disseminating information. Such technological  developments can be used for self-directed learning purposes  if creatively designed. One such effort  is being made by the Kellogg Project at Syracuse University.

This multi-million  dollar  project, funded by the W. K. Kellogg Foundation (Battle  Creek,  Michigan), has  been  designed  to  create  a  system of  adult education  knowledge-dissemination through advanced  computer  technology. The  world's  largest  repository  of  English-language  adult  education materials, housed in the university library, serves  as the foundation for the dissemination  effort.

The  project  has  both  technological and  intellectual  components.  The technological component  features a computerized  system  for  storing  and retrieving  archival documents.  It also has a computer-mediated  electronic network, referred to  as  AEDNET - Adult  Education Network. AEDNET  has enabled adult educators from  all over the world to communicate with each other  electronically.  It  operates  on  BITNET,  an  international computer network currently  joining universities and other research institutions on five continents.  AEDNET features electronic messaging, electronic  conferencing, electronic forums,  and an electronic journal entitled New Horizons in Adult Education.

There  are also  a number of intellectual components.  For  example, the project sponsors research on the historically-rich  adult education  collection at  Syracuse  University  and periodically  holds  conferences  on campus.  In addition,  a  distance  education  program  is  being  developed  that  operates through  computer  conferencing  software.  Through  this  program,  it  is possible  for learners to work individually or to interact with the instructor and students as needed.

Having  access  to  such  a  system  can  add  immensely  to  the  power  an educator has in meeting the needs of adult learners.  Self-directed learners may, in  fact,  benefit  the  most  from  access  to  increased  information and improved retrieval systems, assuming that they have access to the systems and know how to use them.

The notion of being able to retrieve lots of information by  oneself  has implications  for  self-directed  learning  approaches and  resources.  Adult

## 166 Fostering opportunities for self-direction

educators who work with  self-directed learners need to find ways to  help such learners access and utilize appropriate information more effectively.

## BARRIERS TO IMPLEMENTING SELF-DIRECTED LEARNING IN INSTITUTIONS

Are there  barriers that  can  hinder the implementation of self-directed learning approaches  and programs?  Cross suggests there are at least three types of barriers that inhibit adult learning, and that each of these types has relevance for self-direction in learning:

Situational barriers are those arising from one's situation in life at a given time. Lack of time due to job and home responsibilities,  for example  ... Institutional  barriers consist  of  all those  practices  and procedures  that exclude or discourage working adults from  participating in educational activities -  inconvenient  schedules or locations,  full-time  fees for parttime study, inappropriate  courses of study, and so forth. Dispositional barriers are those related to attitudes and self-perceptions  about oneself as a learner.

(Cross,  1981: 98)

For example, an inadequate place to study in the home setting, a situational barrier may prevent a person from taking on an independent learning project. Some learners will have had past negative experiences in educational settings and will believe they are incapable of independent study -  a dispositional barrier. In addition, many administrators have traditional views about education and how courses must be taught, an institutional barrier, that prevents them from understanding the potential value for learners of opportunities for self- direction. Sometimes such views are compounded by a desire to "do it the old way" or a feeling that regular, credit courses  are the only means of programming that are permissible. In addition, there may even exist a  variety of policies or procedures  that prevent independent decision-making on the part  of  the  learner  regarding  such  issues  as  needs,  goals,  content,  and evaluation  aproaches. Facilitators,  program  designers,  and  administrators need to work constantly in attempting to remove or lessen such barriers.

## CONCLUSION

Throughout this chapter we have decribed how institutions  have  become more responsive to the idea  of self-direction in learning as a  way of life. While it  would be  naive  to  suggest  that  all  of  the  strategies  described  will  be accepted overnight throughout the educational world, we do believe that it is important for institutions to recognize the potential of self-direction as a

## Institutional perspectives  on self-direction 167

way of enhancing adult learning experiences. We conclude this chapter with four recommendations that summarize key ideas developed throughout the previous pages.

- 1  It  is  important  that  administrators  who can  affect  decisions  regarding education be helped  to understand  the theory, research,  and  teachinglearning approaches related to self-direction in learning.

A related institutional problem centers on the many administrative policies and  procedures that may  inhibit or even  prevent  implementation  of approaches designed to foster self-direction in learning. For instance, many formal organizations have fairly rigid policies regarding registration, attendance,  and the format for classes. Similarly, a number of grading  traditions may be in place that penalize adult learners who wish to set their own pace or level of achievement, such as limitations  to the use of learning contracts, pass/fail grades, and incomplete grades. In addition, budgetary limitations or standardized approaches  to the use of supportive materials in the  classroom may make it difficult  for teachers  to provide  a variety of resources  for the self-directed learner.

- 2  It is often necessary that the teacher of adult learners must spend  considerable time and energy fostering change in those institutional policies and procedures that inhibit self-direction in learning. At times this will require courage,  persistence,  and  fortitude in  the  light  of  heavy  institutional pressure to resist such change.

A larger problem sometimes exists within educational institutions or even organizations like businesses which sponsor a variety of training programs. The  problem  is  that  negative  attitudes  of  inadequately  trained  educators frequently  become  a barrier in the decision-making  process. For example, some trainers in an organization may employ only traditional approaches  to teaching where the instructor is used primarily as an authority who passes on certain  information to trainees. Then,  when another trainer attempts to use self-directed  learning approaches  that call  for  involving  the  trainee  in  the educational process, this becomes threatening to the normal way. As another example, some elementary school teachers  hired  to teach  evening literacy classes  may be  unwilling to permit the  flexibility necessary  for  an adult learner to use individualized study materials in the program's learning center.

- 3  It is important that all educators of adults  receive adequate preparation in adult education principles, beliefs,  and instructional  approaches.  It may be necessary  for some beginning  adult education teachers  to undertake considerable  graduate or in-service training,  so that personal philoso-

## 168 Fostering opportunities for self-direction

phies, teaching  approaches,  and beliefs regarding adults as learners can be re-examined.

The  wide  range  of  dispositional  barriers  described  by  Cross  (1981)  can actually be more problematic in promoting self-direction in learning, at least initially. For example, many adults approaching  a learning situation bring to it  a  variety  of  negative  ideas  about  education.  Some  of  the  institutional obstacles  described  above have helped  to create many of these, but so have the variety of situational barriers  that each adult must face from day to day. Thus, a fear of something unknown or different,  suspicions  about what that so-called facilitator really is trying to do, and a general lack of understanding about  personal  potential  as  a  learner  are  factors  with  which  most  adult education teachers will have to deal. In our view, the individualized approach we have described  in previous chapters can be used with people  who have widely varying degrees of preparedness  for self-direction  in learning  activities, but some learners will resist such an approach initially because of low self-concepts  or past negative learning  experiences.

- 4  It is usually necessary  that  the adult education  instructor  prepare  for a wide variety of attitudes about  and willingness  to participate  in  selfdirected learning. This will require patience,  the ability to  communicate clearly to learners about the teaching  approach  being used, and a recognition  that the rate of acceptance  of self-directed  approaches  will vary from learner to learner.

Perhaps the biggest weapon a teacher or trainer has in overcoming the many barriers that inhibit self-direction in learning is the constant  striving to ensure that a high quality learning experience  exists. This will require hard work, continual  efforts  at  securing  good  learning  resources, and  the  flexibility necessary  to  deal  with  varied  learning  needs  and  abilities.  However,  we believe  that the results will be well worth those  efforts.

In this book we have presented our views  regarding the value of self-direction in learning as a means for helping people  cope with the many demands of living characterized  by constant  and rapid change.  But how widespread is the  acceptance of views like ours? There  is considerable  evidence  that an increasing acceptance  is  taking  place.  Much  of  the  research  reported  in Chapters  3, 4,  and  5 included  discussion  on the growing  involvement  of adults in learning, and many formal institutions involved with education are increasing  their attention to the adult learner. In Chapter  10 we also  discuss the implementation of self-directed learning activities from a global perspective.  Chapter  12 offers  a scenario illustrating  such  acceptance,  which we anticipate could be present by the turn of the century.

However, we think an appropriate question to ask is: "Are  we at present a self-directed learning society?  " We believe the answer is no, and think that much more attention must be given to understanding the societal implications of  learning  as  a  crucial  component  of  successful  lifelong  living.  We  are concerned, too, that educational and political leaders at national levels have not yet fully  understood the importance of learners taking responsibility for their own education. Indeed, at least in North America, it appears that many higher  education  administrators  and,  increasingly,  private  entrepreneurs seem to be embracing the adult learner primarily as a clientele base of dollars waiting to be spent on educational resources  and  opportunities.

Obviously, there are some such administrators and private organizations dedicated to serving the adult learner, as was pointed out in Chapter 8, but Cross sums up our discomfort nicely:

I am becoming increasingly concerned  about the overeagerness of some colleges to attract adult learners into college classrooms; their goal would appear to be institutional  survival rather than social good.... I believe that all education, especially post-secondary  education,  should  be directed toward  making  people  more  self-directed  learners,  and  colleges  can

## 170 Fostering opportunities for self-direction

contribute very constructively to that goal if they are encouraged  to think beyond  institutional  survival  to  providing  for  the  real  needs  of  adult learners.

(Cross, 1980:  629)

This concern closely parallels  some of the ethical concerns we have related to self-directed learning,  These are discussed  in Chapter  11.

Still other educators  or entrepreneurs  working  with adult programs  are either discounting self-directed adult-learning research or  viewing  the attempts  to  serve  self-directed  learners  as  threatening  to  their  own  head counts. Unfortunately, in our view, there have been far too few reports in the literature  of  efforts  to  think  through  the  implications, policy  needs,  and programming  changes related  to self-direction  in learning,  as well as  the appropriate roles for educators and educational  institutions.

Jarvis (1985) is one of few authors to discuss policy issues related to the adult learner. He applies various social policy models to adult and continuing education, but concludes  that  much more public  debate  is needed.  Hilton (1982) and Ziegler (1982) also urge more discussion  and a comprehensive human policy related to the education of adults. Tough (1978)  suggests we need  to explore  the various  steps  learners  take  in  their  learning  to  better understand the implications for public policy. One of us has noted that some policies are needed so that self-directed learners are not exploited by institutions (Hiemstra, 1980). Rivera calls for more systematic study of  policy needs and concludes that "the subject of adult education  policy,  and particularly public policy, demands greater attention as a discipline for research" (Rivera, 1982: viii).

Caffarella and O'Donnell (1988:55) ask several policy-related questions: "What is the role of the adult educator? What are the involvement parameters for educational institutions? What does the concept  of self-directed learning mean to society as a whole? ". After presenting  some policy statements that have been gleaned from the literature, they conclude  that we must carry out research  to answer such questions,  and derive  policy  to guide people  and institutions  as  they  seek  to  utilize  education  in  meeting  life's  challenges (Caffarella  and O'Donnell,  1987,  1988).

## A POLICY-BUILDING WORKSHOP

In  anticipation of the need  for such guiding policy,  one of us conducted  a workshop  several  years  ago  aimed  at  the  derivation  of  policy  related  to self-directed learning  (Hiemstra,  1980).  Many  of  the  policy  statements derived then are still relevant, while others have been updated for presentation in this chapter to reflect societal changes and the growing understanding

of self-direction in learning during the past several years. In addition, some implementation recommendations are presented to help guide readers of this book as they consider how various policy statements might  be applied to their personal  or professional  situations,  or as they advocate policy  development within various levels of government.

## The derivation of policy

The development of policy  applicable  for learners,  educators,  and educational  institutions  is  a  difficult and  complicated activity.  It  requires  a willingness  to consider  the knowledge  within various other  disciplines  as well as in the adult education field  itself. It also necessitates  recognition of the complex  nature of most human or societal problems and requires  integration  of  knowledge, beliefs,  and practice.  The  application  of  personal  and institutional philosophies to the policy-building process can also be a crucial step (Hiemstra, 1988b). Finally, incorporating policy recommendations into daily practice requires much care, dedication, and patience.

When a policy statement or recommendation is described, it can be used in  various  ways, -  as an organizational  directive,  societal  rule or norms, institutional procedures, bureaucratic necessity, and even personal tradition. This  complex  situation  can  lead  to  considerable  confusion  in  trying  to communicate about or implement policies. Thus, for purposes of this discussion, the following definitions are presented:

- 1  Rule  - an  inflexible regulation or statement of action or  inaction that does not permit any deviation  or allow for any individual  judgment. In general, the  fewer  the  rules  the  better  in  facilitating  smooth  operation  or  in promoting individual  initiative.
- 2 Directive -  a specific order describing  an ad hoc or one-time course of action.
- 3 Procedure -  a specific, step-by-step description of  how  to perform some task. This might apply to individual or to routine organizational activities.
- 4 Policy -  a recommended course of action for achieving some goal or  for meeting  some need. In general,  policies are used  at  an  organizational level, but they can be used even at individual or societal levels in guiding activities.

For purposes of this chapter, the key word in the above definition of policy is "recommended", as we believe that  policies should be used as a framework for  decision-making, not as rules or directives. In other words, the purpose of  a  policy  is  to  provide  for  the  integration  of  institutional  or  personal philosophies  with such elements as needs, objectives, and available resour-

## 172 Fostering opportunities for self-direction

ces. This integration  should provide for operational  guidelines at both individual and organizational levels.

The writing of policies requires clear, concise language that communicates easily to others.  Policy statements should be comprehensive  in terms of demonstrating  linkages  to societal  issues. If possible,  they should have long-  as  well  as  short-term  consequences. In  addition,  such  statements usually need to address potential political  ramifications,  although there will be times when, to reflect an individual's  philosophy,  a policy  will counter prevailing organizational or societal norms. Priorities are another consideration,  in  that  certain  policies  may  need  to  take  precedence  over  others. Finally, the comprehensiveness of a  policy usually must  be examined in light of  available  institutional resources  if a realistic expectation  that it will be implemented is to be made.

## Impediments to implementing policy

We hope that people reading this book will think about how self-direction in learning applies to their personal practice  as educators or as representatives of institutions involved in various forms  of education or training. The policies presented in this chapter are aimed at guiding implementation efforts. However,  as  Gross  (1977)  noted,  there  are  a  variety  of  impediments to  the implementation of policies,  and most policies need to be  filtered  through ethical, bureaucratic,  and personal  concerns.

For example, problems for which some policies seem to be relevant may actually have been diagnosed incorrectly or improperly. The accurate identification of problems requires some care, or at least careful interpretation, of various  points  of  view.  At  the  organizational  level,  we  recommend  that problems be reexamined by a team of individuals to determine their cause, those  affected,  and the importance  of their solution to the organization. A change in procedure or a one-time directive may be more appropriate than implementing some policy. At the individual level, careful reexamination of a policy may result in new insights that, in turn, lead to seeking new guiding policies.

There  also  will  be  instances  where  administrators  who  set  policy  or implement policy changes do not identify  and deal effectively  with various related obstacles. For instance, potential staff  opposition,  skills required to meet some new requirement, conflicts  with existing policy,  and resources required for implementation all need to be examined.  There also may be times when policies  will  not  even be  compatible  with the  existing educational programs. In some cases the obstacles, opposition, or incompatibility will be severe  enough  that  a policy  cannot  be  implemented or it  will need  to be phased in over a long period of time.

It is  also  true that a policy  appropriate  in one place  may not always be transportable  to a different place. Widely publicized, interesting, or "trendy" innovations  at the national level may drain some organizations' resources or may  run  so  counter  to  local  traditions  or  educational  philosophies  that employees and even program participants resent them. A successful individualized learning center that uses learning kits or on-line conferencing may be appropriate in an urban center, but the same approaches can fail miserably in a rural setting where daily contact with mentors or fellow learners is used to meet social as well as learning  needs.

Within some organizations it is also important to consider various administrative  details  that  affect the  derivation  and  implementation  of  policy statements. In other words, thinking through the procedures and leadership responsible  for introducing and implementing policy is very important. For example, good evaluation, monitoring, and feedback mechanisms should be in place so that assessment and the use of assessment information is a normal procedure. We believe, too, that it is crucial to involve staff,  teachers, and even learners, if possible, in determining and introducing policy, so that they can feel ownership very early in the process and not feel that policy has been dictated from  the top.

There  also are many questions that can be asked prior to beginning the derivation of policies. These are detailed in Table 9.1. Such questions should be helpful  in stimulating dialogue and action among those concerned  with the policies.

## The workshop process

The workshop from which many of the policy statements presented later in this  chapter  were derived  was held  at Iowa State  University in  1980  and involved sixteen people representing a variety of professional backgrounds and walks of life (Hiemstra, 1980). Workshop participants who contributed to the development of the policy statements discussed later in the chapter are listed in Appendix B.

In addition, eight people served as staff members or consultants in some capacity, all of whom have carried  out research  related  to self-directed or lifelong learning, including Hassan (1982), Hiemstra (1976b), Judd (1980), Kurland (1980), Leean and Sisco (1981) Tough (1979), Umoren (1978), and Zangari (1978). Participants piet 3  hours daily in aclassroom setting,  Monday through Friday, for 2 weeks. In addition, they met together for several hours outside  of  class  for  small group  work, individual  study,  and  final  policy development efforts.

The workshop used a process  that maximized participant involvement, input, and feedback. The process included needs diagnosis, small and large

group  discussions,  agenda building, clarifying  procedures,  and  deriving formats  for  policy.  In  addition,  individual  commitments  for  work  to  be produced throughout  the experience were made through interactive feedback activities,  individual discussions  with  the  workshop  leader,  and  various evaluation processes.

Perhaps the most difficult  task of the entire workshop was developing a format for describing policy statements and corresponding implementation recommendations. The  literature  provides  a  variety  of  suggestions  for developing policy; often a suggestion in one source will conflict with or have no relationship to those found  in other sources.  For example, Gilder (1979, 1980)  writes  about  a policy  framework primarily  in  terms  of  providing guidelines  for  decision-making.  One  specialist  urged  that  policy  specify exactly  which learners are to be served and which content areas are to be stressed (Gross, 1980). Ziegler and Healy (1979) advocated the formation of policy teams and the use of various futures-invention activities to develop

policy  recommendations, where  participants forecast  future events  and design actions or policies related to the predictions.

Another difficult task for workshop participants  was synthesizing  a procedure  for  developing and  writing  policy  statements. Several  sources providing  ideas  on  what  should  be  included  in  a policy  statement  were considered. For example, the Croft Educational Services provided information on how to develop policies for public school boards. Weichenthal (1980) described policy making needs for continuing higher education institutions. Ziegler (1970) suggested several criteria to be used in policy formation. Such information helped participants select a format for stating needs, purposes, policy  statements, and  implementation recommendations.  These  last  two elements will be represented in the remainder of the material for this chapter.

## POLICY STATEMENTS

The process utilized during the workshop described above resulted in three small groups developing around mutual interests and backgrounds. Group members'  preferences  and  suggestions  evolved  into  three  categories  for discussion and policy  formulation:

- 1 Adults as learners - the  student perspective
- 2 Adult educators - the  teacher/facilitator  perspective
- 3 Adult education agencies - the  institutional perspective

Each group, therefore, assumed responsibility for developing policy for only one of these three categories  so that the efforts could be concentrated. Thus, the policy statements and  implementation recommendations presented in this chapter address these three perspectives,  adapted from  the 1980  workshop. Their use as policies and action guides by any organization  or person will need to take into account these specific audience focuses. However, it is our hope  that they will serve  as a beginning  point  for  individual facilitators, agency administrators, and organizational employees to analyze their involvement with self-directed learning activities.

## Adults as learners

Policy recommendation I

Each  adult  learner  should  be  acknowledged  as having unlimited learning potential and given respect as a self-directed learner.

## 176 Fostering opportunities for self-direction

## Implementation strategies:

- 1  Utilize small  discussion  groups  or  create  learning  networks  to  assist learners in discovering through trial and error, their own gifts and talents.
- 2  Offer opportunities for learners to focus on their own individual strengths.
- 3  Broaden the availability of educational  resources that teach  about  personal potential, learning skills, and using learning materials.
- 4  Help  individuals  in  adult  teaching  roles  to  understand  their  role  in promoting self-direction in learning.

## Policy recommendation II

Learners  should  be  encouraged to  objectively examine  their  personal strengths and weaknesses as a means for gaining self acceptance, capitalizing on individual  assets, and setting goals.

## Implementation strategies:

- 1  Provide  opportunities  for  learners  to  carry  out  self-inventories  or  to complete self-concept measures.
- 2  Provide facilitators,  learning consultants, or counselors who have skill in discussing self-inventory results as information for planning.

## Policy recommendation III

Learners should be helped to develop and strengthen internal-reinforcement mechanisms to ensure continuous growth in their learning  efforts.

## Implementation strategies

- 1  Provide access to and skill in using a variety of reinforcement resources such as meditation  techniques, personal-journal or  diary-writing processes, and critical-thinking techniques.
- 2  Train  teachers  and  learning  facilitators  to  help  learners  strengthen personal-growth skills.
- 3  Seek  learning resources  and techniques  that help learners with internal reinforcement.

## Policy recommendation IV

Learners need to be helped to understand  their own learning or  cognitive style, and utilize such information in shaping their educational  efforts.

## Implementation  strategies

- 1 Provide opportunities  for learners to complete measures of learning and cognitive styles as an informational basis for future  planning.
- 2  Train teachers, counselors,  and learning facilitators to interpret and use information on styles in assisting  learners with their planning.

## Policy recommendation V

Learners  should be encouraged  to form  autonomous  learning  and  support groups as a means of capitalizing  on synergistic learning  efforts.

## Implementation strategies

- 1  Develop learner hotlines using such agencies  as libraries, learning brokers, and universities to provide support or coordination.
- 2  Promote the concept of learner advocacy at various adult learning centers and within various adult education professional  associations.
- 3  Establish learning exchange networks in local communities as suggested by Draves (1980), Illich (1971), and Peterson  and Associates  (1979).
- 4  Establish study circles patterned after  the Scandinavian  system of both topical and open-topic types (Kurland, 1982; Oliver,  1987).
- 5  Foster  peer  support  groups  or  systems  revolving  around  a  variety of content areas.

## Policy recommendation VI

Learners  need  to  be  supported  and  provided  with  opportunities  to  take individual responsibility for their own learning.

## Implementation strategies

- 1 Provide appropriate administrative support necessary to foster individual adult initiative,  such as convenient scheduling, adequate resources, childcare services, and adult-counseling programs.
- 2  Foster time management and good planning through related  workshops or learning materials.

- 1  Examine learning techniques and skills necessary both for learners and for  facilitators.
- 2  Identify means for enhancing learners' problem-solving, resource-utilization, and evaluation skills.
- 3  Explore the applicability of self-directed learning techniques to various subject-matter  areas as an expansion of the work reported  by Knowles and Associates (1984).
- 4  Identify those adults  who are reluctant to utilize self-directed approaches, and determine if such approaches  would be beneficial in their learning endeavors.
- 5  Study the relationship between developmental  life  stages  and various self-direction approaches to determine their appropriateness to aperson's stage in life.

## Policy recommendation  VIII

Adult educators need to receive training in utilizing theories  and practices related to self-direction in learning.

## Implementation strategies

- 1  Provide  students in formal  adult education  training  programs  with an understanding of self-directed learning concepts and approaches.
- 2  Provide in-service training in self-directed learning approaches for the many teachers of adults who have not received any formal training  related to the topic.

## Adult education  agencies

## Policy recommendation IX

Adult  educators  need  to  help  agencies  serving  adults  to  incorporate  the concepts of self-directed learning into their normal operating procedures.

## Implementation  strategies

- 1 Promote the use of self-direction approaches through the development of individualized  resources,  creation  of  self-study  materials,  and  establishment of appropriate learning settings or mechanisms.
- 2 Conduct  needs  assessments  of  learners  to  determine  possibilities  for self-directed  learning and provide such information to agency administrators and other personnel.
- 3 Assist agencies in their utilization  of self-directed  learning  approaches and  help  to  coordinate  the  implementation  of  related  resources  and services.

## Policy recommendation X

Agencies, organizations,  and institutions working in some way with adult learners need to provide opportunities for administrators, faculty,  and  staff to become knowledgeable  about self-directed approaches.

## Implementation strategies

- 1 Provide  employees with an awareness  of the research  and related  literature pertaining to self-direction in learning.
- 2 Provide employees workshops, in-service training, and resource material related to self-direction in learning.

## Policy recommendation XI

Agencies, organizations,  and institutions  working in some  way with adult learners  need  to  develop  and  maintain  various  measures  or  criteria  for accountability and  evaluation,  so  that  the  effectiveness  and  value  of self-directed  learning can be ascertained.

## Implementation strategies

- 1  Develop  reporting  systems  that  will include  and  facilitate  the  use of various non-traditional data-collection and reporting  mechanisms, such as learning contracts, mentoring or internship reports, and credit for  work experiences.
- 2 Experiment  with new and innovative  evaluation  methods  -  such  as interviewing, networking assessments, and validation through electronic means.

## 180 Fostering opportunities for self-direction

## Policy recommendation Xll

Agencies, organizations,  and institutions  working  in some  way with adult learners  need  to  seek  legislation  and  funding  to  promote  and  facilitate self-direction in learning at local, state, and national  levels.

## Implementation strategies

- 1  Secure learning resources and other kinds of study opportunities, such as internship assignments, agency visitations,  and sharing of library materials, from a multitude of community agencies.
- 2  Influence legislation by working with professional associations,  contacting legislators, and  seeking various kinds of public support for individualized learning efforts.

## Policy recommendation  XIII

Agencies,  organizations,  and institutions  working in some  way with adult learners  need  to  provide  support  services  that  help  those  desiring  to  be self-directed as they adjust to  various individualized activities and any related changes in self-concept or approaches to learning.

## Implementation strategies

- 1  Establish centers or special locations within agency settings where such learners can gather, obtain necessary  resources, and support each other.
- 2  Provide support personnel with appropriate expertise to counsel with  and help adults make effective use of their newly acquired skills and knowledge.

## Policy recommendation XIV

Agencies, organizations, and institutions working in some way with adult learners  need  to  provide  physical  environments  that  accommodate  and facilitate self-direction in learning.

## Implementation strategies:

- 1  Examine the  various  physical  environments  in  which  learning  takes place, and make changes consistent with many of those recommended in this book,  and elsewhere (Hiemstra,  1988a; Hiemstra and Sisco,  1990; Vosko, 1984,1985; Vosko and Hiemstra,  1988).

- 2 Provide an on-site specialist on physical learning environments  who can work  with  facilitators  and  learners  in  designing  appropriate physical conditions.

## CONCLUSION

Policy is a concern that is frequently overlooked  by educators of adults. Yet each  of  us  is,  in  one  way  or  another,  involved  in  the  development  or implementation  of policy.  Our intent  in this chapter  has been  to present  a series of recommendations with the hope that these might serve as some basic goals toward which the adult education field can strive. Further, we hope to encourage readers to become proactive regarding the creation of a future in which the self-directed learner can thrive. Other recommendations outside the area of policy are made in the final chapter.

Many  of  the  policies  and  implementation  recommendations  presented actually may appear impossible to achieve, impractical to manage, or even too visionary in nature at first reading. Some obviously require considerable change in philosophies, new administrative mechanisms, and the  expenditure of new monies. In addition, what may seem practical or appropriate in one locale will not be possible or feasible in another.

However, it is our belief that  what  may seem visionary or impossible today will become commonplace procedures if the learning approaches  to life that we  project  throughout  this  book come  to  full fruition. In  fact,  many experimental programs and creative  means for reaching  self-directed adult learners are already in place, as noted in earlier chapters.

It  also  is obvious that refinement of the policies suggested  above must take place as we learn more about self-direction in learning and as various facilitators  or agencies attempt to utilize them. Many new policies will be required,  too,  as  research  and  experience  pushes  forward  the knowledge about  learning preferences,  approaches,  and  needs.  We  believe  that  the increasing interest in serving adult-learning  needs and in helping adults cope with the ever-increasing pace of change  will facilitate the meeting of such requirements.

## 10  The global context

Profound  changes  of various types throughout  the world have caused  profound thinking regarding the role that education must play in helping people enhance the quality of their lives.  Compton  and Parish suggest  that at least three concerns  must be addressed in some way through educational  efforts:

- 1  The increasing  gap between the rich and the poor;  the gap between rich nations and developing nations.
- 2  The disproportionate  share  of the world's resources  now allotted to the dominant world.
- 3  The increasing  awareness in the Third  World of the double standard of living.

(Compton and Parish,  1978: 31)

Such concerns as these plus the constancy  and rapidity of change, suggest to us  a  need  to  help  people  make  the  most  of  their  individual  potential. Boucouvalas  describes  a  standing  regulation  in Greece  that  captures  this notion of promoting individual ability: "The  view of...  [each person]  as a self-sufficient  and independent personality  and as the agent of...  [personal] development" (Boucouvalas,  1982:  30). It seems that learner  self-direction and self-directed learning skills are crucial to the achievement of this human potential.

The  study  of  self-directed  learning  appears  to be  primarily  western  in orientation and interest, with little relationship  to many parts of the world. In fact, the  majority  of  recent  research, writings,  and  language  related  to self-direction in learning have emanated from North America. According to Brookfield: "the majority of studies in this field have been conducted with samples of advantaged, white, middle-class Americans." (Brookfield, 1986: 51). He was referring here primarily to research related to learning projects (Tough, 1979) or the Self-directed Learning Readiness Scale (Guglielmino, 1977); indeed, there does not yet exist a large volume of related literature outside of North America although it is developing.

We thus believe that it is important to our success with adults as learners to take a more global approach in our understandings about self-direction in learning. We realize  that not all our  assumptions  about learners  and their abilities  to  accept  personal  responsibility  will  translate  entirely  from  one setting or culture to another. However, this chapter's  purpose  is to present some reflections and understandings regarding the universality of self-directed learning principles and approaches.

## SOME INTERNATIONAL PERSPECTIVES ON SELF-DIRECTION

We will present some background information before launching into discussions about self-directed learning in selected  countries.  Both of us have had many  international  students  in  our  courses.  Observing  the  successes  and difficulties  involved  with facilitating  their independent  learning have provided  us  with  some  understanding  of  requirements  across  cultures  in applying self-directed learning principles. We also have examined some of the international literature related to self-directed  learning  and have interviewed  and talked informally with several  people from  other countries  to obtain their views regarding such topics  as autonomy, learner control, and instructor roles. Thus, what will follow is a summary  of the literature we have studied regarding self-direction in selected settings outside of North America.  In  addition, for  two countries  (Indonesia  and Tanzania),  we present  a description of how indigenous adult educators believe that self-direction in learning would be possible in their respective  countries.

We  also  need  to  say  something  about  the  nature  of  self-direction  in learning in various cultures. Based  on our reading  and conversations  with people from various countries, there seem to be many different  ideas about what it means to study or plan  individually.  One country  will have  as an avowed policy the promotion of individual learning ability, while at the same time  advocating  participation  in  governmental sponsored programs  to achieve  such  a goal,  Another  country  will  talk  about  self-education  as a primary means for adults to learn, but the nature of the programs described would indicate to a North American observer that few opportunities exist for individualized decision-making regarding the learning process.

Another problem stems from  the structural design of certain  approaches intended  to  promote  independent  study.  For  example,  a  correspondence course that requires strict adherence to a  planned route of readings and  testing procedures  may  offer  little  freedom  to  the  learner  other  than  pacing  or sequencing of micro-learning components.  Ljosa and Sandvold (1983), on the  other  hand, make a case  for  the  various  ways by  which  learners  can

## 184 Fostering opportunities for self-direction

exercise freedom of choice within the didactical structure of  correspondence education.

Moore (1983:  24-5)  describes  how he thought about learner freedom in designing  an  Open  University  course.  The  course  was  based  on:  (a)  a psychological  climate that emphasized  learner decision-making  and experience;  (b) an emphasis  on self-diagnosis;  (c) a personally  planned  route of study;  (d)  a  tutor  seen  as  a  resource  person; (e)  some  learner-designed evaluation criteria; and (f)  an emphasis on each student's personal  learning experiences.

A wide range exists in interpreting and permitting freedoms such as these within the learning setting. As noted earlier in the chapter, some suggest that self-direction is primarily a middle-class, white phenomenon by its emphasis on the individual. Even though some research  has demonstrated that certain self-directed  learning  concepts  hold  across  racial,  economic,  and  social groupings,  the  concepts  may  not  always directly  apply  in  other  cultural contexts.  However,  we  firmly  believe  that  as  long  as  cultural  context  is recognized  and respected, it is possible to apply many of the  instructional and learning tips described in this book in any setting.

There  are  many  countries  that  should  be  examined  in  terms  of  their self-directed practices, activities, or philosophies.  However, that needs to be the  subject of  another  book  as we work toward  a better  understanding  of various implications for the way in which adults are helped in their efforts to maximize their potential. In this section, we touch on just a few countries in order to highlight interesting aspects  of self-direction  in  different  cultural contexts.

## Scandinavia

Scandinavian countries have a long history of adult education.  Grundtvig's pioneering  work in Denmark with the folk high school movement began in 1844 (Andresen, 1985; Engberg-Pedersen,  1970; Kulich,  1984). Grundtvig, in developing the folk high school movement (high school in Danish means a university-like setting), wanted an educational  experience  for adults that was residential in nature but small in scope. He also  wanted a mixture of practical and theoretical work, supported by lots of discussion (Himmelstrup, 1988), These institutions  therefore stress work in the group setting, and are aimed at the individual development of each person. In fact, their methods and environment are designed to encourage  individuals of all social classes to broaden their personal horizons  (Andresen,  1985: 20). Folk schools  have spread to many other countries in the past century and a half.

Sweden has made several efforts  to promote education for adults that is self-directed in  nature.  One  stated  adult  education  aim  of  the  Swedish

government, for example, is to cater "to individual preferences  and needs" (Hall,  1981:  7). A 1977  governmental ordinance  called for learning  opportunities to increase awareness of personal capacity, to develop  independence, to promote creativity, and to foster critical reflectivity (Svensson,  1988).

One of the most innovative approaches  to adult education has been the study circle. These have been used to provide many citizens in Sweden (and elsewhere)  with  an  opportunity  to  develop  self-study  skills.  As  Kurland (1982) has stated:

various religious and political  groups found in the study circle  a kind of self-help arrangement that enabled an essentially uneducated populace to understand the issues of the day and learn the practical skills necessary to improve their lot in life.  Using their own homes as places of study, with no  formally  trained teachers  and limited study materials, people  had to rely  on  their  own  experience  and  their  ability  to  share  it  with  others. Studies had  to be immediately  practical,  related to their own needs, or firmly  rooted  in the particular popular  movement in whose  cause they were enrolled.

(Kurland, 1982: 24)

While  the  group  emphasis  of  the  study  circle  at  first  glance  may  seem inconsistent  with  notions  of  self-direction,  Oliver  (1987:  5)  states  that, historically in Sweden: "study circles encouraged self-directed learning and full participation,  blending the intensive small group format with  traditional Swedish culture -  particularly  small-town life and the face-to-face conversations of friends and neighbors". Svensson (1988) notes that more than 2.5 million people  are  involved in  Swedish study circles  each  year, with 1.5 million of these  women.

While not quite as popular, another important Swedish form of individualized learning  is  correspondence study.  The  country  has  three such organizations: "one  that  is  authorized  to  hold  examinations  for  formal educational institutions, one that provides study materials that do not lead to any formal qualifications, and one that provides agricultural  correspondence materials"  (Darkenwald  and Merriam,  1982:  197).  Nearly 20,000  people each year enroll in correspondence  study (Svensson,  1988).

In Norway, correspondence  schools  have long played a very important role in educating adults (Pardoen,  1977). In fact, Norway's Adult  Education Act of  1976 was intended to influence learning throughout life and "should give the core ingredient for ... self-managed learning throughout the rest of life"  (Pardoen,  1977:  14-15).  Finland,  too,  has  several correspondence institutes  that  offer  expert  aid  through  study centers  to  assist  individual students in their educational efforts  (Royce,  1970).

## 186 Fostering opportunities for self-direction

## United Kingdom

The United Kingdom is perhaps most well-known in the area of self-directed education for its pioneering work with the open university concept described in Chapter 8. There are also many other opportunities for the learner interested in independent study. For example, the number of adults studying by correspondence in the UK is estimated to "range from 500,000 to 750,000 a year" (Darkenwald and Merriam, 1982:197).

Another imaginative attempt to foster independent learning took place at Malvern Hills College,  the center for adult education  in the rural English counties  of  Hereford  and Worcester.  Several  adult students were having difficulty  attending a regular college class. Thus, a Correspondence  Tuition Service  was established, to "provide  individually oriented  programmes of home  study supported  by personal  tutorials"  (Brookfield,  1978:  19).  An initial diagnostic interview between a  tutor and  the student,  tutorial assistance with learning projects, and home study correspondence courses are some of the available resources.

Brookfield  (1981b)  also  describes  his  research,  which  examined  the self-directed efforts of individuals not associated with any formal organization or institution.  He chose twenty-five  working-class  individuals whose formal education had ended at age 16, and whose expertise stemmed from extensive study of, or involvement with, a hobby or personal-interest  area. His research helped to advance earlier work, primarily in North America, related to learning projects. It also demonstrated that independent efforts  to obtain mastery over some area of study can take place across a wide range of  cultural and  educational  backgrounds.  He  concluded  that  many adult learners will look to other learners for information and support rather than to societies,  organizations,  and professional  educators.  He  noted:  "subjects would  mention influential books and magazines but  would preface these comments by declaring their 'real' source of information was their  fellow enthusiasts" (Brookfield, 1981b: 21).

## Japan

Japan's progress in industrialization since the Second World War, coupled with  its  more  recent  emergence  as  a  world  leader  in  various  ways, has prompted a  variety of changes within the country. These range from a  growth of pizza parlors and fast-food restaurants, to increasing  disposable  income for most  people, and a  constant contact with  other nations. Such changes  have also affected education in many ways, including the education of adults. As one example, open-university-type programs reach  adults throughout the society (Darkenwald  and Merriam, 1982).

The pressure to be part of a societal group remains, but subtle changes are taking place in education. A  Japanese professor, Seiichiro Miura, who works with adult education activities, was interviewed about adult education in his country. He describes the change as follows:

One thing I might mention is the use of groups in adult education practice. I recognize  the heavy emphasis in the United States on the self-directed learner. But from looking at human  nature I suggest it is not easy for some to  be self-directed. In  Japan,  we would organize a  self-directed group,  kind of  a  mixture between  group  study [sic]. Subtle  group  pressure  and  a Japanese sensitivity to groups promote a  kind of invisible network forcing you to be there, to participate even when you may be reluctant to attend.

Thus,  you  sacrifice  your  individual  desire  to  the  group.  I  call  this interdependent learning rather than independent learning.

(Hiemstra, 1981c:30)

Professor Miura was also asked how he would introduce learning contracts, frequently used in self-directed learning efforts, into the Japanese culture: "I will introduce the idea of the learning contract but it will be utilized within a group setting. I will need to introduce it slowly and find the ways it can work" (Hiemstra, 198Ic: 30).

Thus, Japan appears to be in a transitional state where the sanctity of the group is being reevaluated in terms of individual  needs and wishes. This may be most clear in adult  education efforts with  older Japanese. Sekiguchi (1985) describes  a  1981  Recommendation  Paper  by  the  Central  Committee  on Education.  Among  the Paper's  recommendations  is  a  call  for  the  older person's self-education. As a method of study, "learning in a large group or in a classroom will not be adequate since there is a great difference between individual learners. Instead, individual learning methods are recommended as a more suitable way" (Sekiguchi,  1985: 290). Facilities such as libraries, museums, and similar institutions are suggested as organizations which need to play a more active role in meeting older adults' needs. Study courses on radio and television and correspondence  courses are recommended as effective methods for the older person.

## China

The changes that have taken place in China during late 1989 and on into the 1990s make it difficult to comprehend fully what the future holds. However, the last several years have been marked by some important changes relative to adult learning:  "Since 1977, when the expansion and  restructuring of adult education began after the Cultural Revolution, important changes have taken place in many sectors of adult education" (Sidel,  1982: 38). For example,

## 188 Fostering opportunities for self-direction

current  radio  and  television  delivery  methods  are  patterned  after  Great Britain's  Open  University.  The  Chinese Television University  (TVU) opened  in  1979  and provides  several  degree  opportunities.  In fact,  TVUs operate at  the national and municipal levels. Televised instruction is  also  used at  factory  colleges, spare-time  colleges,  and  regular  universities  (Long, 1982). Municipal television universities and corresponding  study centers in a variety of settings cooperate  with centralized  programming  efforts.  They serve some 800,000 registered students and many more casual viewers who do not enroll for credit.

There are other forms of adult education in China that offer some opportunities for individualized learning. Correspondence courses are available, and individual tutoring is sometimes available. In 1980 factory universities setup correspondence courses that enrolled 240,000 students (Sidel, 1982). Zhou  (1988)  reports  that there  are  some  32,000  people  enrolled  in independent correspondence  colleges, and another 150,000 students enrolled in 148 evening college correspondence  divisions.

The "visiting teacher" program also offers  opportunities  for a learner to work individually after the teacher provides some initial assistance: "In this program, literacy is taught by a teacher who visits the peasant's home and labels common household objects with the appropriate Chinese  characters. The learner thus learns the characters  as the items are used" (Long,  1982: 13).

## Soviet Union

The concept of self-direction in learning is referred to in the Soviet Union as self-education. The country's beliefs regarding why a  person should develop self-directed  study skills sound very much like what an advocate  in North America would say:

The role of self-education naturally increases in adults, for the potential possibilities of the personality  are extremely great, and the formed world outlook, self-awareness and will make it possible  to develop one's abilities  more  successfully,  systematically  and  comprehensively.  This  is especially  true since  life  does not  stand  still  and society  is developing scientifically and technically. Anyone who does not engage in self-education, voluntarily or not, lags behind the demands of the times.

(Ruvinsky, 1986: 31)

Several examples of Soviets engaged in self-education illustrate how the concept is  employed:

The well-known Soviet test-pilot Mikhail Gromov (1899-1984) said, for

example, that, by means of self-education, ahigh degree of perfection may be  achieved  in one's personal  qualities  and the new  habits  and skills required  for the chosen profession  may be  acquired,

(Ruvinsky, 1986:  32).

The  Soviet  scientist  Aksel  Berg's  idea  was that  real  character  cannot  be formed without effort: "moreover, constant self-observation and self-accountability  are required, and there may even be temporary falls, trips and other fluctuations, which, in fact, reveals the dialectical character of the process  of  self-education"  (Ruvinsky,  1986:  32).  The  examples  are  not confined just to the most famous people in the society: "workers ... not only acquire  professional  knowledge  in  the process  of  self-teaching,  but  also develop their creative abilities and  raise their cultural level"  (Ruvinsky, 1986: 96).

Ruvinsky  also  suggests  there  are  some  techniques  that can  be used  to facilitate independent study efforts: (a) write what is being learned in a  diary or special notebook;  (b) organize  and classify  the information  in terms of some goals; (c) learn to separate primary concepts from secondary  concepts (Ruvinsky, 1986: 94-5). Correspondence  study also is a widely used adultlearning method, and "evening and correspondence  studies last a year longer than regular studies.  Studies at evening  and correspondence faculties are regarded as a  matter  of  enormous social interest and significance" (Savicevic, 1981:77).

## Indonesia

Traditional  beliefs  and expectations  in Indonesia regarding  learning  have placed  the instructor in a role as authority figure. In fact, learners  have not been  given  many  opportunities  to  assess  personal  needs  as  a  basis  for learning. These learners also usually expect the teacher to be an authority on whatever subject matter is being discussed. Furthermore,  they view experiential learning activities, such as using various community resources  outside the classroom,  as a waste of time. They would believe  that such time could more  appropriately  be  spent  in  the  classroom listening  to  an  instructor. However, increasing  levels of education  among the population  and a better understanding of teaching approaches outside of Indonesia among educators are  indicators  that  self-direction  in  learning  is  possible  with  appropriate modifications.

For  example, one  Indonesian  educator  studying  adult education  in the United  States  told one  of  the authors  how  he  would  apply  various self-directed  learning  techniques  in  introducing  family  planning  to  community leaders when  he returned home (M. M. Maudz, personal

## 190 Fostering opportunities for self-direction

communication  with  R.  Hiemstra,  January  11,  1988).  During  his  initial contact with the leaders he would discuss the importance for the country of the content  to be covered.  He would also discuss with them their  learning needs,  based  on  their  roles,  tasks,  and  functions  as  community  leaders. Because he would be viewed as the authority, he would come well prepared and make the initial presentation with the use of various audio-visual aids.

The participants  would then complete a pre-designed,  needs-assessment form, and come to some initial conclusions regarding personal needs.  This educator would then lead a general discussion to determine needs, strengths, and weaknesses among the group. He would begin by listing learning needs on a chalk board or on poster paper, and ask participants  to help him rank them.  He  would  conclude  with  a  summary  of  the  needs,  strengths,  and weaknesses.  Then  a description  sheet  of  the  content  areas  that  could  be covered during subsequent sessions would be distributed and discussed. He would make every effort  to accommodate  the uncovered needs,  but would be very specific in describing those content  areas that he believed  must be covered because of official  requirements or his own personal  convictions, even if they did not match well with the rankings.

After that initial session, he would spend time putting together the plans for  remaining  sessions.  This  would  include  determining  who  would  be responsible  for various content areas,  what learning aids would be needed, what teaching  and learning  techniques  would be used, and what arrangements were needed for outside resources or resource leaders. Passive learning activities  would  be  expected,  although  small  group  discussion  could  be designed  for occasional  use. If any individualized or experiential  learning activities were desired or necessary, special efforts would be needed to make clear the importance of such experiences.  As evaluation in the form of testing would  be  the  normal  expectation,  some  efforts  would also  be needed  to design the procedures and instruments.

Thus, some of the self-direction procedures described  in this book would be possible, but the instructor or trainer would need to explain such  procedures  very  carefully and  help  participants understand  how  they  would enhance the learning. Cultural traditions and expectations regarding the role of the instructor do not rule out more individualized approaches, but adaptations based on an understanding of prior expectations  of student and teacher roles would be required.

## Tanzania

In Tanzania  a general respect  for elders and people  in authority permeates the culture.  Thus, most Tanzanian students have certain expectations regarding their roles  and the roles  of instructors.  For example, frequently  small

group discussion  will take place only after the teacher has spent considerable time lecturing about a subject, Even the small group discussion typically will center on questions posed by the instructor, although students feel they have some latitude in discussing areas beyond the instructor's  questions.

Experiential  learning  activities  will  be looked  at by  most  learners  and instructors  as a waste of time. They  fear  that such  activities  will take time away from the instructor's lecturing.  Although a few learners  would thrive on experiential  or self-directed  learning  approaches,  many learners  would probably believe that an instructor  using such approaches  did not know the subject matter and was employing them to cover up for inadequacies.  One Tanzanian adult educator studying in the United States  felt that back home his biggest hurdle would be the unwillingness of his university  administrators and fellow  teachers to accept  teaching  approaches  that placed  considerable responsibility  on the learner (A. C. Mgulambwa, personal  communication with R. Hiemstra, January 11,1988).

Another problem area revolves around evaluation and grading. Many of the current traditions of grading were inherited from the British, and the result is  usually  a  highly  structured  process.  For  example,  many  teachers  are expected  or even required  to give  a certain  number of lower grades.  The Tanzanian adult educator mentioned above, who by the time of the interview had  considerable experiences  with self-directed  learning  in the  classroom from his United States graduate  training, felt that the use of a learning contract in his country would be problematic.

The above points suggest that the employment of self-directed learning principles  in  Tanzania  would  be  difficult, at  least  initially,  because  of traditional expectations about education. However, one of the authors spent some time in Tanzania and observed some self-directed adult learning taking place  at the village level (Hiemstra, 1987a).  In fact, the country supports  a national policy  of "self-reliance," in which elected  village  leaders  take on primary responsibility for local development.

The policy has worked only moderately well in some parts of the nation and  not  well  at  all  in  others.  However,  it  may  have  begun  a  process  of self-determination in some parts of the country that is translatable to other villages:

I had the opportunity to visit three villages where male and female leaders had been trained at the regional  sites and observed  what appeared to be high levels of excitement  by villagers at their ability to diagnose and work on their problems. My interviews with village chiefs, council members, and district officials substantiated such observations, I also had the opportunity to observe village leaders conduct training courses  with villagers and viewed what I believe to be real (and I suspect newly learned) efforts

## 192 Fostering opportunities for self-direction

to  diagnose  needs,  involve  villagers  in  planning,  and  encourage  selfplanned  efforts.

(Hiemstra, 1987a:  8-9)

This  special  effort  to promote personal responsibility  can perhaps best  be summarized with a statement from an evaluation report:

[the project] demonstrates the power of adult education methods centered on experiential, problem-solving  techniques  to evoke  change. It shows that these methods are applicable to working with  highly educated people as  well  as villagers  ... the  trainee  is  actively  involved  in  the  learning process.

(Training for Rural Development,  1984: 16)

Thus, in Tanzania (and in other countries as well), there is an apparent need to overcome some traditions and cultural expectations in using self-direction approaches to learning. However, appropriate adaptations are possible:

I believe that  most adults  appreciate the opportunity to explore their needs, especially if they can turn such needs into real programs... I was perhaps most surprised at the apparent willingness of village chiefs and other top leaders (almost always older males) to incorporate  women and younger men in the various  processes of diagnosing needs, collaborative planning, and even  evaluation.

(Hiemstra, 1987a: 13)

## Eastern Europe

In most Eastern European countries, a variety of independent study opportunities exist. Correspondence  study seems to be quite popular for the learner who,  out  of  preference  or  necessity,  selects  individualized  approaches. Albanian  workers are encouraged  to educate  themselves through various forms  of  education,  including  correspondence study  (Savicevic, 1981). Correspondence is also one of the favored  delivery  methods for adult  learning in Bulgaria  and Poland (Savicevic, 1981).

In Germany, correspondence education is recognized as equal in value to other forms of adult study: "Those who acquire education in this manner are offered special  facilities  and  encouragement,  such  as  leave  from  work amounting to seventy-seven days per year while retaining the right to a full income" (Savicevic, 1981:59). In Hungary, combining both correspondence study and evening courses, according to a 1975 study, "those who acquired a  degree in  this manner were 45.2% of  the  total  number of people  who received a university  degree"  (Savicevic, 1981: 63). In Rumania nearly 30

percent  of  all  adult  students  study  either  at  evening  schools  or  through correspondence.

Yugoslavia  is perhaps  the most  progressive  of  these  countries.  It  has schools  of self-guided learners, developed  through federal legislation, and other institutions through which the individual learner uses various educational  resources,  such  as  cultural  centers,  museums,  and  libraries.  The country  also  was  among the  first  nations  to provide  special  study  on  the conception of andragogy, including both graduate and undergraduate study (Savicevic, 1981).

Obviously, the events that have taken place throughout eastern Europe in the dawn of the 1990s will have an impact on the education of adults. While it is too early to speculate  with any high degree of confidence,  we believe that these  changes signal  potential for  positive developments  on  the self-direction  front.  Only time will tell, though, what specific  impact may take place.

## Saudi Arabia

In Saudi  Arabia adult education  has become a  social imperative as the  country attempts various modernization efforts:

Saudi Arabia needs  the characteristics of modern man who is ready for new experiences, accepts change, and looks toward the future more than to the past or present. He should believe in education and technology and his own ability to improve himself.

(Hamidi, 1979:  30).

Many of the initial educational efforts in this modernization  movement have been related to literacy. Much of the recent  success can be attributed to the heavy use  of  television  as  an individualized  means of reaching  people  at home, especially women (Hamidi, 1979).

## CONCLUSION

Perhaps the most obvious conclusion  that can be drawn is that  considerable variance exists across various cultures and geographic  settings. We believe that  the promotion  of  self-directedness  can  be considered  a  phenomenon transferable to most cultural  settings. For  example, in a  study  of 1,000 people in  Czechoslovakia,  Hungary, Poland,  France,  Soviet  Union, Yugoslavia, United States, and Canada, nearly half used some form of self-instruction to acquire some basic information (Savicevic, 1985). It also was found that the higher the level of education, the more people are engaged in self-education.

How do we make sense out of such research? Is this finding  something

## 194 Fostering opportunities for self-direction

that can be applied universally across all cultures? It probably is not, but we simply  do not  yet  have  a clear  enough  understanding  of  differences and similarities. What then are some obvious needs and conclusions  as we think about self-direction in learning from  a global context?

In making comparisons  across various countries  we also need to ask if group processes can  be used  for  individual or self-directed development. Himmelstrup (1988), for example,  noted that Denmark has few opportunities for  self-directed study  because  the emphasis  has long  been  on  the  social aspect of organizations like the folk high school. This obviously can be said about many other countries. Thus, can self-direction in learning be successful within countries  or cultural settings  where group or social processes have been stressed?

We believe  that  many of  the  principles  and practices  associated  with self-direction  in  learning  can  have  relevance  within  the  context  of  most cultures;  however,  we  are  quick  to  acknowledge  that  our  perspective  is primarily a North American one. Thus, we offer  the following as needs for further work on gaining a more global perspective relative to self-direction.

- 1  There  is a need  to carry out more cross-cultural  research  on the many implications for training adult educators, developing learning resources, and helping learners to make the best choices regarding their learning. Similarly, we need to begin developing research  agendas that will consider self-direction more directly from specific cultural contexts.
- 2  There are cultural differences that must be understood  in working with learners who may prefer to be self-directed.  Expectations  regarding the role  of  the  teacher,  the  student, and  the group  will  differ,  so  teaching techniques  will  need  to  be  adjusted  accordingly.  Societal  differences regarding the value of the group over the individual also need to be better understood.
- 3  The willingness and readiness to employ self-directed learning approaches within  various countries is constantly changing and  evolving. Thus it is important that the exchange of ideas across geographic borders takes place on a regular basis  through cross-cultural research, international conferences, and visiting scholar programs.

## 11  Ethical dilemmas in self-direction

The late Harry Chapin once wrote a song telling the story of Mr. Tanner, a fictitious dry-cleaning store owner who found great pleasure in singing as he worked. As the story goes,  friends and customers were so impressed with Mr. Tanner*s avocational  abilities that they encouraged  him to consider  a professional singing career. Eventually he agreed and, after spending most of his life savings, made his public singing debut. The critics were less than kind, suggesting that 'full-time consideration  of another endeavor might be in order*. Mr. Tanner  returned home to his business,  saying nothing  about his demise. But he never sang again, except alone late at night after the shop had closed.

There is an important message in the story of Mr. Tanner for those of us committed  to  promoting  self-direction  in  learning  as  a  way  of  life.  This message has to do with the potential consequences of our intervention with learners. We must be careful  that in our zeal to promote  opportunities for self-directed  learning and to enhance  learner self-direction, we do not inadvertently help set such learners  up  for failure.  We need to recognize that ideals such as "efficiency" and "success" are value-laden and relative and, for  many people, are much less important than the enjoyment of the learning process itself. In the case of Mr. Tanner, it was the urging, or intervention, of others that led him to seek wider recognition for his success. In turn, this intervention led Mr. Tanner to false expectations that helped  set him up for failure. And while it can be argued that had Mr. Tanner not taken the risk, he never would have known what could have been, the point is that, without outside intervention,  Mr.  Tanner  might have  gone  on  deriving  pleasure  from  his self-defined  personal  success as a singer.

The above illustration  points out potential risks of  jumping too quickly on to  the  self-direction "bandwagon,"  where  the  joys  of  self-direction are uncritically extolled.  The previous chapters offered a look at  numerous trends and  issues relative to the importance  of  self-direction as  a way  of  life  for

## 196 Fostering opportunities for self-direction

many adults. It is our belief that self-direction needs to be viewed as a major element of adult education practice.  At the same time, however, we are not suggesting  that  self-direction is the purpose  of  adult  education  or  that self-direction is ideal in all adult learning endeavors. The ten myths that were presented and discussed  in Chapter  1  help to illustrate many of the junctures at which ethical dilemmas can arise in  self-direction.

In this chapter, we will explore some of the potential ethical conflicts that can arise in promoting self-direction among adult learners. Included will be a brief overview of adult education ethics. From this, we will shift the focus toward an application  of ethics to self-direction  in adult learning. This will include a  discussion based on  ideas from a workshop  on  ethics  in self-direction  that  helped  to  lay  the  groundwork  for  some  of  our  current thinking. The chapter will conclude  with a look at several ethical dilemmas relative to self-direction in learning.

## ETHICS IN ADULT  EDUCATION

Few would argue the relevance  of ethics as an element of adult education practice. Yet, as has been the case with the area of self-direction, this topic has been largely ignored in the literature of adult education. A recent book, however, has offered perspectives from several writers in the adult  education field who take a look at ethics in such areas as program planning, marketing, administration,  evaluation,  teaching, advising, and  research  (Brockett, 1988c). The  book  also  addresses  such  issues  as social  responsibility  and ethics,  the code-of-ethics  question,  ethical  development  in adulthood, and development of a personal  philosophy.

What  do  we  mean  by "ethics"? Ethics  is  an elusive  term  that  can  be discussed  on at least two levels. First, ethics refers to a branch  of inquiry within the discipline of philosophy. Here, emphasis is on the formal study of "right and wrong, of good and evil, in human conduct" (Fagothey, 1972; 2). This study is sometimes referred to as "metaethics" (e.g., Reamer,  1982).

On  another  level, ethics  involves  the  application  of  values in  order  to determine the Brightness" or "wrongness" of specific behaviors in specific situations.  It is  this applied view of ethics,  often referred to as "normative ethics" (e.g., Reamer, 1982), that is of particular relevance to professions or professionalizing  fields,  such as adult education. Bayles (1981: 3) has suggested that professional ethics "encompasses all issues involving ethics and values  in  the  roles  of  the  professions  and  the  conduct  of professionals  in society".

Although there is considerable  controversy over the question of whether adult education is, indeed, a profession, it is nonetheless clear that situations abound  in  the  education  of  adults  where  the  potential  for  inappropriate

behavior  exists. As  a way of understanding  the different kinds of ethical questions that  can  arise in  adult  education practice,  a  model  has  been proposed  where  three  dimensions, or  levels,  of  ethical  practice  can  be identified  and differentiated. The "Dimensions of Ethical  Practice" model (Brockett, 1988b) suggests that ethical dilemmas can be identified along the following three  dimensions:

- 1 The personal value system of the adult educator;
- 2  A consideration of multiple audiences to whom the educator of adults is responsible;  and
- 3 The ways in which values are put into practice,  or operationalized.

The starting point  for ethical decision  making, according  to this model, can be  found  within  the personal  value  system. This  dimension  stresses  the importance of individual values and is reflected in ethical dilemmas that can arise due to conflicts that a person holds within his or her own value system. The  importance  of  a given dilemma is compounded  by  the  strength with which one holds such values. For example, an educator who believes that adult learning should be a voluntary activity will face conflict in a situation where learners  are required to attend a particular  activity. If this belief is a strong  conviction,  the  degree  of conflict  will  be  much  greater  than  if  the person  merely states a "preference" for voluntary  learning.

The next dimension of ethical practice  centers on the recognition  that as educators,  our  responsibilities extend  in  many  directions. In  any  given situation,  we have  responsibilities  to the learners,  the institution,  our  colleagues, the profession, society, and ourselves. Meeting one set of responsibilities  often  creates  a conflict  with another  set of  responsibilities. This is exemplified by the educator who feels he or she is  "compromising" personal values through any number of activities, such as; advising learners to enroll in a particular  course in order to increase enrollments, regardless of whether  the  course  will  meet  learner  needs;  attempting  to  discredit  the programs of competing agencies; or not fully  informing learners of what to expect from  the learning experience.  As another example, take the case of someone conducting an internal evaluation of an agency. In finding that the agency may be overstaffed, the evaluator is placed in an emotional tug-of-war between (a) creating a potential threat to the livelihood of colleagues and (b) failing to report findings that could lead to more effective resource  utilization by the institution. At this level of ethical practice,  it is crucial  for the adult educator to strive toward a balance in meeting these multiple responsibilities. It  is necessary  to  set priorities  "based  on the  anticipated  consequences  of one's  actions  and accepting  responsibility  for those  actions" (Brockett, 1988b:  12).

In the third dimension of ethical practice, which involves the operation-

## 198 Fostering opportunities for self-direction

alization of values, the emphasis  shifts to an identification of strategies that will help put values into practice. Taken to an extreme, this is where a code of ethics  can become  relevant.  However,  the real concern  here  is that the educator should be able to reflect critically  on his or her values relative to the education of adults. The development of a personal  philosophy  can be a valuable tool in helping educators become better  able to identify potential ethical conflicts (Hiemstra, 1988b).

The Dimensions  of Ethical Practice  model is not a formal theory. Nor is it a prescriptive  model offering solutions to specific situations.  Rather, it is a process model designed to help educators of adults identify and recognize some of the points at which ethical conflict can arise in their practice. In this way, the model is viewed as a consciousness-raising tool. As Bayles (1981: 3) has stated, the "study of professional ethics will hopefully sensitize one to the  ethical dimensions of professional practice  and help one think clearly about ethical problems". The Dimensions of Ethical Practice model can be viewed as a tool that adult educators can use in order to facilitate this  study.

## A WORKSHOP ON ETHICS AND SELF-DIRECTED ADULT LEARNING

As the idea of self-direction came to take an increasingly greater hold on the adult education field, particularly during the late  1970s,  a number of questions began to emerge relative to potential  misuses or abuses of principles growing out of the self-direction notion. Yet, as of the early 1980s, there had been no serious effort to address what might be viewed as "ethical issues" in self-directed learning. In order to begin considering  some of these  concerns, the first author of this book decided to conduct a workshop entitled "Ethical Issues  in  Self-Directed  Learning"  as  a  major  element  of  a three-credit graduate course on self-directed learning held at Syracuse University  during the Summer 1983 term. Drawing in part from the process used by Hiemstra in his  two workshops  (policy and institutional issues),  discussed  in other chapters, each participant was asked to develop a position paper on a topic relative to ethics and self-directed learning. These papers were distributed to all participants and presented toward the end of the workshop. The names of workshop participants are listed in Appendix B. The six position papers were as follows:

- 1  "Self-directed learning: Appropriate for all?" (Reynolds, 1983);
- 2  "The  rights  and responsibilities of institutions promoting self-directed learning." (Henry, 1983)
- 3  "Rights and responsibilities  of the self-directed learner." (Alegria, 1983)
- 4  "The ethics of promoting self-directed learning." (Creighton, 1983)

- 5 "Love of learning  and lived experience:  Necessary  ingredients  for the self-directed  adult learner," (Kaluzny,  1983)
- 6 "Philosophy and facilitation of self-directed learning." (Bentti,  1983)

Upon presentation  of these papers,  each  author was asked  to glean two or more principles that could be included in a "manifesto/bill of rights" statement. More than twenty-five principles  were presented.  The entire list was discussed  extensively among the group and a final list of sixteen  principles was derived. These principles  are presented  in Table  11.1.

The recommendations listed in Table  11.1 were not intended to serve as a "code of ethics" for working with self-directed learners. Rather, they were viewed  as principles  or ideas  deemed  by  workshop  participants  as being worthy of further  consideration.  We would suggest that there is a need for the field to move toward a greater awareness of ethical concerns if we are to help  prevent  future  abuses  or  misuses.  This  may  or  may  not eventually involve  the development of a "formalized"  set of standards or  a "code of ethics." It would, however, serve to bring such concerns  to the forefront  of our consciousness as adult educators.

In reflecting on these points, it is clear that in many ways, we have begun to make progress relative to ethics in adult education and, more specifically, in  self-direction.  We  hope  this  chapter,  in  conjunction  with  the  book described above (Brockett, 1988c) and other periodical literature  on the topic (e.g., Singarella and Sork, 1983) will stimulate  even more thinking on ethical issues.

## SELF-DIRECTION AND ETHICS: SOME DILEMMAS

It should be apparent that the potential for ethical conflict  clearly exists  within the  realm  of  self-direction  in  adult  learning.  The  questions  that  follow represent  four  illustrations of how ethical  conflict  can arise.  The  first  two questions  relate  to the  learner-facilitator relationship  while the latter two questions pertain to institutional issues.

## Are there situations where intervention can actually be detrimental to the learning process?

It is clear  from  previous research  (e.g., Tough,  1979) that a key reason  for the appeal of self-direction is that many adults feel it is the most efficient way for them to learn. By being able to select their own objectives, set schedules according to personal preferences, identify preferred strategies, and  evaluate when objectives have been  met, many adults believe that they are able to learn in a more efficient  way. For such individuals, self-direction is viewed

- 1  Self-directedness exists in varying degrees within different  individuals. It is not an "all  or nothing*' notion.
- 2  Self-directeness is more appropriate for some adults than for others.
- 3  One's level of readiness for self-directed learning  depends on development and cognitive growth.
- 4  It is possible to assess or determine an individual's degree of self-directedness.
- 5  Self-directed  learning offers  numerous emerging roles for the educator of adults.
- 6  An individual's level of self-directedness can be strengthened or weakened by love of learning and/or lived (i.e., life)  experience.
- 7  Self-directed  learning can  be  viewed  as  a  method  for  supporting  the voluntary nature of adult education.
- 8  Existing  mandatory continuing  education  programs  should  recognize, respect, and accommodate the needs and learning styles of the self-directed  learner.
- 9  Educators of adults  need to be able to help learners realize their potential for self-directedness.
- 10 Institutions that  wish to  serve  self-directed  adult  learners  need  to possess  goals,  objectives,  and  underlying  values  that  are  compatible  with  this  approach.  At  the  same  time,  institutions  have  a right  to  offer  programs  that  are  not  necessarily  in  harmony  with self-directedness.
- 11 Institutions need  to provide a wide range of resources  and services  to assist the self-directed learner. These can include direct services  such as facilitating  the  learning  process  as  well  as  support  services  such  as counseling and referral.
- 12 The learner has a right to services that will support his or her efforts as a self-directed learner.
- 13 Institutions that support self-directed  learning need to provide a climate conducive to this kind of learning. This climate includes both the physical facilities and a positive emotional and intellectual  atmosphere.
- 14 The self-directed  learner must be willing to assume primary responsibility for his or her learning.
- 15 The freedom  to choose self-directed learning is a highly personal  issue and involves a great degree of initiative, perseverance, and self-discipline.
- 16 The self-directed learner should possess a number of basic rights, but must also be willing to accept responsibility for utilizing these rights.

as less costly, both  in terms of time and money, than other  approaches  to learning. However, an ethical dilemma arises when we assume that efficiency and self-direction need necessarily be  linked.

Consider  the example of two friends who each have an interest in railroading. One of the friends pursues this interest  by enrolling  in courses  on the history of railroading  and by regular visits  to the library to read books and  articles  on  railroading.  The  other  friend  chooses  to  spend  summers visiting  old railroading  sites  and talking  with local  people  who can  share stories about railroading. When the two friends get together to "trade notes" on  their  endeavors,  they  find  that  they  have  uncovered  much  the  same information. The main difference is that the friend who took courses and read about the topic spent considerably less time and money than the other friend. What might  happen if the first person sought to intervene and "help" the other person become "more efficient" as a learner. From the viewpoint of an adult educator, it would be easy to conclude that since the former approach  was more  efficient,  it  is  likely  to  also  be  more  successful.  To  take  this view, however, would be very shortsighted, since it fails to take into consideration the different  motives of each person  for undertaking the learning project.

In  looking  at  this  situation from  an "outside" perspective  we  may  be inclined to conclude that the person who chose the more "formal" route was more  "successful"  than  the  individual  who  chose  to  visit  sites  and  talk informally  with people about railroading. And, indeed, if success is defined as efficiency, such an assessment  would be accurate.

However, it is important to bear in mind that adults  engage in learning for a variety of reasons.  For some, success  is measured in terms of outcomes derived from the experience. On the other hand, there are many individuals who find joy in the process of learning. The person  who visited railroading sites built family  vacations around such travel so that everyone could  find some joy  in the "process" being used. For these individuals, the joy  comes not so much from what is learned as from how it is learned.

The dilemma for us as adult educators, in such cases, arises from our zeal to help learners become more effective  in the learning process.  By stressing the importance of efficiency  to the exclusion of other possible  motives for learning, we run the risk of turning off learners who were already doing quite well without  our "assistance," regardless of how well-intentioned that assistance was.  Sometimes,  we  need  to  tread lightly  when  working  with self-directed learners and recognize that, at times, we can do more harm than good in our educational intervention, despite our best  intentions.

## 202 Fostering opportunities for self-direction

## Are there situations  where facilitators  can compromise quality of a learning experience  through inappropriate use of  self-directed learning strategies?

With the increasing emphasis on self-direction  in adult learning, it is crucial that  practitioners understand what the  concept means. We have tried to  clarify some of the confusion surrounding the idea in previous  chapters;  yet this is only  a beginning.  Another  ethical  issue  can  arise  when  an educator  who misunderstands  the  complexity  of  self-direction attempts  to jump on  the bandwagon without first reflecting on the consequences of such actions.

Among the myths presented in Chapter  1  is the idea that self-direction is an "easy way out" for instructors. This  can be illustrated by the instructor who walks into class with little or no advanced planning and asks  students "OK, now, what do you want to do in this class?" In our view, this is not a case of facilitating self-direction; in fact, we are inclined to call this approach "non-directed  learning.  "

In reality, as was stressed in Chapter 6, facilitating self-directed learning is a very demanding  and active role. We are convinced, in fact, that it is even more  demanding  than  the  more  traditional  adult  teaching  role.  Why? Because,  in  addition to  having  an  understanding  of  the  content  area,  a facilitator of self-directed learning must get to know each learner and be able to help them to develop and explore personal  interest areas.  So instead of working with ten people  who are all doing the same activities at the same pace,  the facilitator of self-directed  learning may end up working with ten people each with very different needs and interests and only a minimal level of common interest.

It should  be  clear  that  there  is  a  very  fine  line  between  promoting self-direction and non-direction. We believe that the successful facilitator of self-directed  learning  needs  to  assume  a proactive  role  in  working  with learners. There is, too, much to be lost if this is not done.

## To what extent can institutions realistically promote self-direction in learning?

One of the most pervasive problems encountered when implementing opportunities for self-direction  can arise when institutions are faced with the often delicate  balance  between  encouraging  individual  autonomy  and  learner options while  maintaining  adherence to existing policies and procedures. For both of us, as faculty members in graduate programs of adult education,  this dilemma  has  been  particularly  thorny.  On  the  one  hand,  we  are deeply committed to implementing the values and practices described throughout the previous chapters of this book. At the same time, however, we are  fully

aware of  the  roles  and responsibilities  we have  undertaken  by  accepting positions within our particular institutions of higher education. Such policies as assigning grades for coursework, adhering to an academic calendar, and setting and maintaining requirements for admission to and completion of the graduate program  would seem to run contrary  to the more "free  spirited" ideals that seem a part of self-direction in learning.

For us, the resolution  of this dilemma comes through understanding the first myth  presented in Chapter 1. By viewing self-direction  as a  continuum, one could argue that all learning activities and institutional settings more or less promote, encourage, or allow a certain degree of self-direction. In this view,  the  question  is not,  "Can  self-direction  in  learning  exist  within an institutional  setting?" but, rather,  "To  what extent can self-direction exist within the institution?  ".

The ethical dilemma arises  when instructors/facilitators  fail  to acknowledge this question of degree. It is misleading to say that a course  will be a "self-directed learning experience" and then spell out specific course requirements and grading policies. Indeed, we believe that much of the skepticism that exists about self-direction in adult learning is due more to the ways in which it is sometimes misused than to the underlying principles  of self-direction  themselves.  Thus,  the  ethical  concern arises  when  the  learning experience is not what individuals  were led to believe it would be.

One way to minimize this potential dilemma  is for an instructor to be open with learners from the outset. We typically do this by telling learners in our classes that it is our goal to provide an environment that will foster "greater" opportunities  for  self-direction,  and that  we  will support  a wide range of options that will allow individuals to pursue personally identified  goals and objectives. At the same time, we openly acknowledge the parameters within which  we  are  operating  (and,  in  fact,  have  agreed  to  operate  within  as employees  and  students  of  our  particular institution).  By taking  this approach,  we can ethically state  that we are helping  learners  work toward greater self-direction while not misleading  them by claiming  the course to be entirely  self-directed.

## To what extent is self-direction in learning a panacea?

The current wave of interest in the idea of self-direction  in learning  is an outgrowth of the  1970s,  which carried  over  to the  1980s and promises  to continue into the 1990s. The concept seems to coincide with notions  associated with the "me generation" and to an obsession with "finding oneself and "being all one can be."  Thus, one might criticize  the entire  self-direction movement as merely a way of popularizing hedonism. However, as we have stressed throughout  the book, self-direction is  not  just another adult education

## 204 Fostering opportunities for self-direction

fad;  it is a way of life  that fits very naturally with how people  go about the task of learning new things in order to deal with the challenges of adult life, including  the  improvement  of  society,  as  well  as  personal growth  and enrichment.

Nonetheless, the idea of self-direction  remains very seductive and marketable.  Of  course,  there  is  nothing  wrong  with  marketing  the  idea  of self-direction in and of itself. Indeed, marketing can be viewed as responding to the identified  needs of adult learners. At the same time, when self-direction is viewed as a "quick fix" or a "cure all*' merely because it "sells," then we should become concerned.  We need to bear in mind a very basic  principle: our priority as educators of adults is to serve the learner. Where self-direction best serves the learner (and we would stress that this is the case more  often than  not),  the  approach  should  be  utilized  and  promoted  actively.  But  it should not be used merely because it sells.

## CONCLUSION

Self-direction holds virtually unlimited potential as a strategy for enhancing the success  of adult learners. As such, it also holds unlimited potential  for expanding the growth of the adult education  field.  As will be discussed in Chapter 13, it is up to us, as educators of adults, to create the kind of  future we desire  for  our  field.  In working  to promote  self-directed  learning  and learner self-direction, the future  can be bright indeed. But it is crucial that we make a deliberate effort  to ask questions  about the ways in which this enthusiasm has the potential to be displaced. To not address potential ethical issues relative to self-direction in adult learning would be short-sighted and, ultimately, could have serious consequences  for our potential,  as educators, for success with adult learners.

## PartV

## A glance at the future

The final part consists  of two chapters designed  to facilitate some thinking about the  future  for  self-direction  in learning.  Chapter  12, A Way  of  Life Revisited, describes the activities in one day for members of a  fictional family in the year 2005.  In many ways, we may have been even conservative  in thinking about all the ways  our lives will  be affected during the next 15 years. Certainly technology will play a part in promoting  many changes, but the point  of  the  chapter  is  to  describe  how  we  believe  learning,  most  of  it self-directed in nature, will become built  into most fabrics of our daily  living. The  final  chapter,  13, presents  some  conclusions  and  recommendations derived  from  the previous chapters. For example, we believe  an important role  for  adult educators  must become  that  of promoting  self-direction  in learning among all adults. We also present several recommendations related to theory, research, and practice.

## 12 A way of life revisited

Mary, Neal, and Alice in Chapter  1  represented real people in today's world who have learned to utilize self-direction in learning as a means to cope with life and its many challenges.  However, we think the future holds even more challenges and  anticipate that  increasing numbers  of  people  will  find self-directed learning activities crucial for survival in a world  of ever-increasing  change.  Thus  we  would  like  to  introduce  the  Hammond family,  five  people  who  find  themselves,  in  the  year  2005,  employing self-direction in many of their daily learning efforts.  Join us in observing a day in the life of the Hammonds.

George  Hammond-Treska is 45 years of age with a doctoral  degree in educational psychology. He is an adjunct professor  at the local university, operates  a  consulting  service that  concentrates on  middle-management recruiting, training, and counseling, and is an avid electronics hobbyist. He generally  operates  the  consulting  service  alone,  although  he  has  several colleagues he can call on for specific needs.  George  has been  a computer technology enthusiast since the late 1980s and owns two personal computers, an optical  scanning system, and a laser transmitter for long-distance  communication.

Greta Treska-Hammond is 43, has a masters degree in social work, and since  1999 has been the director of the local educational brokering service. She has taken special  courses  in small-group therapy for the past  3 years, belongs to two national learning networks, and tries to keeps her hand in the local peace network,  an organization devoted to maintaining the world-wide nuclear freeze achieved in 1998 after the Euro-Baltic missile scare. She does not regret the  12 years of her life devoted to being the major care-giver for the  two children, but continues to be surprised  at the difficulties  she now confronts in meshing a full-time career with supporting two older teens.

Julie is a vivacious 19-year-old who has  just started her second year at the New  Jersey  Open University. She spent the summer in Spain  in a United Nations Study and Volunteer  Program where she studied advanced Spanish,

helped  tutor Chilean  refugees, and enhanced  her  weaving  skills.  She had commented  in August to her parents  that the Westville  Alternative  High School had prepared her well for both tutoring and weaving, although sitting in a weaving class with several others was quite different from her tri-video instructional kits in that she received  quicker feedback  on her skills.

Stan is a muscular young man of 17  who is in his  junior year of high school at the First Westville  Preparatory  School. Taller than his father by a full  6 inches, Stan just found out he made the varsity on the robo-ball team, a new sport that has taken the country by storm  in the past few years.  He will be playing halfwing on offense and robo-tech on defense. Stan was worried that he might not make the team because he spent his interim year apprenticing on the moon's Star-Ill colony, but steady work with the anti-grav equipment apparently paid off. In addition, he only had to spend one week in the SEAT center  (Star/Earth  Adjustment and Training)  upon  his  return so  the extra workouts he did during July and August helped as well.

Bill Hammond, George's father, is a healthy 73 years of age. George had been Bill and Wilma's last child. Wilma's  death in 1969 of cancer resulted in Bill and George having a closer relationship  than many fathers and sons, so when Bill retired in  1996,  George  and Greta had another  bedroom  built and would not hear of Bill moving anywhere else but into their Trenton home. The symbiosis had been fruitful  in many ways. Bill, who loves to tinker, has left  everything around the house  in tip top condition;  George  and Greta's culinary skills have provided Bill with many wonderful meals. Fortunately, the  anti-weight-gain and  cholesterol-reducing  drugs of the past  few years have helped him control his weight.

So here we have a fairly normal family of the year 2005. As a matter of fact, an  annual  census  would  find  the  Hammond  household  just  about mid-center in terms of  American  statistics  in  this  time of  dependency  on electronic technology: one registered Republican, one registered Democrat, and three declared independents;  four automobiles  and one commuter helicopter;  an average  family  income  from  two wage earners  of $300,000 per year;  a house  of  3,300  square  feet  containing 4.5 bathrooms,  an intercom system  with  speakers  in  every  room,  six  radios,  one  large  screen  video receiver and playback system, one 3-D videx receiver, one fax machine, six video-phones,  one  optical  scanning  system  with  both  audio  and digital readers,  five  mini-computer systems,  two  laser  printers,  one dot-matrix multi-font printer and a print spooler,  one laser transmitter, two electronicmail  and  data-retrieval  systems,  two  robo-cleaners,  and  one  combination upload and download  satellite  transmitter system. Now that we have  apicture of this middle-America family, let us follow them on a particular Monday.

6.00 a.m. George, Greta, and  Stan  rise. George does  his stretching

exercises, grabs a glass of water, gets in the car and heads for the Sunup Club for  80 minutes of exercising, Greta does her stretching  exercises and starts out the door for her typical 6-mile run with a group of neighbors. Stan ambles over  to the newly acquired  home exo-arobo machine  and programs in the 20-minute physio-total sequence.

- 6.45 a.m. Stan finishes his shower, grabs a frozen  breakfast for the car's microwave, and starts off for his 30-minute commute to First Westville Prep.
- 7.00 a.m. Bill  wakes, contemplates resetting the alarm for another hour, but remembers his important 9.00  appointment at the senior  center. So he gets up, does his normal  12 minutes on the McKenzie plan, and heads out the door for his 45-minute walk.
- 7.15 a.m. Greta returns, showers, gets dressed and sits down to a breakfast of  amni-biotic flakes, milk, and fruit-bits. She turns on the NeuterRotandnews and begins to read the articles scrolling on the screen in front of her. A piece on the revival of the old National Training Laboratory  catches her eye, she requests a  hard copy, checks the spooler menu to make sure there is an open slot on one of the laser printers, and hears with quiet satisfaction the humming of the machine as the downloading begins. She walks over to the scanner's  audio reader, puts in the audio tape she dictated yesterday on her way home, and begins to read the material as it pops up on the screen.
- 7.30 a.m. Stan arrives at First Prep and ambles into the daily assignment center. He punches in his ID and password  and receives some  suggestions from his psychology mentor for some readings he might try. There also is a request from the microbiology study group leader that all members convene for  a seminar  at  10.00  a.m. He audio-inputs  his  affirmative  response  and heads for the library to do some reading before the meeting.
- 7.40 a.m. George returns, wolfs down an applo-fiber, a glass of lacto-milk, and a  cup of that new mufti herb tea Stan brought back from the moon colony. He then fires up the BIS internet and reads his electronic mail accumulated since last night. He responds to three important messages, uploads a file on management counseling to one of his consultants living in California, and downloads a copy of the latest issue of  Socio-Psych News for reading later in the day. He picks up his new clipboard mini-computer, presses the corner latch, and lifts  up the lipto-laser display panel to reveal the touchpad keyboard. After  a check to see how much memory is left in the Datamold Field Mini-computer's  three-megabyte bubble field, he thinks about how he will pursue mastery of the new on-line  conferencing techniques for one-on-one counseling developed by his professional  association.

8.00  a.m. Bill  finishes his  shower, gets dressed,  and ambles over to his

## 210 A glance at the future

mini-fridge for a usual breakfast of old-fashioned corn flakes and 2 percent milk. After rinsing his dishes, he walks out to the car for the 30-minute drive to the senior center. As he drives he considers what his answer will be to the center  directors  request  that  he  teach  a  woodworking  course  to  center members. He never taught before, but has often thought about it.

8.05 a.m. Greta picks up her briefcase, pops into George's study and gives him a kiss goodbye, checks the electronic sensor to see if Bill is still in his room and then says goodbye to him through the intercom, types out a quick message to both Stan and Julie, and uploads the messages to their electronic mailboxes. She then ambles out to the helicopter, HELEN (Helo-ELectronicEnergy Network), hears its quiet hum as she turns on the network system, and lifts off for the quick commute to her  office.

8.30  a.m. Meanwhile, in that exciting new community under the dome, West  Brunswick, Julie  wakes  and  goes  through  her  normal  routine  of aerobics,  jacuzzi-spray showering, and breakfasting on egg whites,  juice, and cellulose with high-iron toast (what Stan always laughingly calls that "sawdust and rust" bread). She also gives Annie, her friend  in Miami, a call on the video-phone and they critique each other's new haircuts for a while.

9.15  a.m. George connects to the laser transmission satellite, uploads the graphics needed for today's class, and checks his mini-lecture notes. As soon as he  receives  the  class-connect  signal,  he  begins  to  talk  about  learning contracts with his class of graduate students in psychology. He describes the various kinds of learning contracts,  holds up examples for students to see, and  tells  them how  to  download  copies  of  any  of  those  they choose.  He answers an important question from Thabo Bolatto in Capetown and another one from Hilda Correro in Mexico City. He then announces the on-line study group assignments, asks the groups to work on the model-building assignment and to discuss their preferences for either group or individual learning contracts, and reminds students how to contact him on-line for both interactive and delayed communications. Assuring himself that all questions have been answered and the assignment made clear, he signs off the satellite, sends a  report  to  the  central  administration  data  bank,  and begins  checking  his electronic mail for any new messages.

9.45 a.m. Greta finishes a meeting with a client, dictates a quick note via the Newfair Lipto-neutron network her organization  time-shares, and heads out to catch the subway across town for the weekly tele-conference meeting of the Africa-to-America  learning exchange network on small group techniques. She checks her briefcase to make sure her notes are there, as well as the micro-diskette  on which she has stored the three files to be uploaded to all participants at the beginning of the meeting.

10.00 a.m. Julie heads to the West Brunswick Interactive  Museum to work with  a  family  of  low-grav  monkeys  being  groomed  for  life  on  the  Star colonies. Her Open University course on anthropology  requires this hands-on experience  plus a term paper  she has been painfully dictating  into the laser steno each evening.

- 11.15 a.m. Bill pulls into the central library parking lot. He walks into the lobby  and up to the on-line  catalogue  that he has used  so much in the past few years. He keys in a few boolean-based commands centered on the subject of teaching  adults and watches the resulting  "hits" scroll  on the screen. He selects  several  possibilities  and requests  a hard-copy printout.  As he heads for the stacks to look at whatever he can find on his list, he muses again about George's suggestion that he learn to use the electro-library  software on one of the home computer systems. However, he recognizes that he would miss searching for real books on his own.
- 11.30 a.m. As soon as the study group session is over, Stan heads for the student center to have a lunch of syntho-burgers and real fries  with Cindy. He remembers to drop off his chemistry assignment that he had completed last night. He finds Cindy at the front of the building and they head for the cafeteria's food line.
- 12.30  p.m. Greta heads  to the conservatory  two blocks  from  the  teleconference site to take her weekly lesson on the electro-organ.  Her lifelong love for music has not dampened from her early days of piano and trumpet lessons and she finds the discipline of nightly practice to be quite rewarding. As she walks, she reaches in her purse for a laser-dry lunch wafer, reminding herself to grab a non-caffeine  soda from the vendor in front of the conservatory.
- 12.45 p.m. George pops a frozen dinner in the laser-wave, pours a glass of milk, and pulls out the steaming dish. As he eats  the synthetic meat dish, getting used to the taste now that real meat is almost impossible  to get, he puts on a headset and lets the theta wave stabilizer clear out the cobwebs. He remembers that he needs to use the SCALE (Super Computer Analog Library Educer) to research and extract some new management conclusions  before tomorrow's training session with those clinical psychologists  from Asia and Africa.

1.00 p.m. Meanwhile,  Julie  finishes her lunch of sprouts and fruit and heads for her study group on the cultural history of the Aztecs during the late 1400s. On Friday, they had observed some construction  activity during their retrogressive scanning  probe and  were  nearing  an  ability  to  record some supporting data for their hypothesis that the Aztecs had actually invented a

form  of  electrical  transmission.  Today  she  hoped  they  could  refine  the picture, at least on the small scope, so that it could be recorded and translated by the Newfair 4792 lipto-neutron parallel  architecture-based  computer on which they had leased space.

- 2.15 p.m. After a lunch of synthetic pork chops, carrots, green beans, and coffee,  Bill checks the pneumatic  mail tube  to see if any information  has arrived on the elderhostel in Denmark he will be participating  in next month. Finding only a copy  of his Self-Directed Learners Guide, he heads for his room carrying the dozen books he checked  out on teaching  adults. Having decided  to teach  a  woodworking  class, he  follows his  customary  plan of attack in  learning  about a subject, knowing  that he will be as prepared  as possible  when the  class  starts  next  month.  Whoever  said  that  retirement would be boring!
- 4.00 p.m. Greta finishes training her new triad leaders and provides each with a list of their lifelong learning case groups. She then fires up the desktop computer in her office and contacts the LID (Learning Information Database) system in San Jose,  California, to see if any new learning exchange  groups or free university organizations  have been started in her area.
- 4.15  p.m. Stan  heads  for  the  locker  room  to  get  dressed  for  robo-ball practice. He is still thinking about the French class he has just completed and the earlier discussion that emanated from his debriefing group regarding the Star-Ill  experience. The mentors had urged each member to consider  astrophysics as a career, but he is not sure. He still thinks a lot about a career as a professional  robo-ball player, but has not discussed  it with Mom  and Dad recently. Perhaps he should take up that offer  from Pete Marley of the New York Titans and spend a few weeks working with the team during their spring training.
- 4.30 p.m. George and Bill head for the basement shop to continue work on their experimental motor. George's skill in computers and Bill's  experience with piston-driven motors have convinced  them that they can build a better motor for the old rider-mower Bill had brought with him when he sold the house. Bill would like to adapt one of the robo-cleaners for mowing the lawn and George has accepted the challenge of redesigning the computer networks to operate the system. The video version of the Electronics Encyclopedia is already scrolling on the screen in front of them.
- 5.00  p.m. Although the  study  group had not been  able  to find  the  same construction  site because the satellite position had changed and they did not have the new site coordinates,  Julie thought they had made nice progress in the refinement scan. The etched lines on the face of the woman carrying the

water were so powerfully shown that Julie had decided to use the hard copy printout as the basis for her next art project. As she entered the studio of her water-colors mentor, she began to think about how to convince him that she could combine her electronic  pictures with his somewhat archaic  approach: using hand brush strokes.

6.30  p.m. Greta finishes her last report for the day, files a copy  electronically, and requests the software to archive a hard copy in the Trenton  central office.  She walks to the "chopper*' as Bill fondly calls  it, heads  for home wondering  what  George  has  prepared  for  the  evening  meal,  and  looks forward to some conversation  with the men in her life and, later, relaxation with the electro-organ.  Fortunately, tonight she has no office  work to catch up on. She might even have an opportunity to do some reading for pleasure.

6.45 p.m. George heads to the kitchen and pulls out several containers from the proto-freezer.  He decided that they will eat Mexican food that evening, and he busies himself with setting the table, chilling the wine,  programming the robo-cleaner for a quick run-through of the dining room, and checking the electronic mail while  the food cooks in the standard oven and laser-wave. He then decides to give his brother, Charley, a call on the video-phone to see if he would like a game of astro-golf  on the weekend.

7.30  p.m. Stan rushes in, says a quick "hi"  to everyone, gobbles down an enchilada  and taco, still warm on the dining  room  table.  He punches  in a ticket request for himself and Cindy at the downtown holograph-movie,  gets a confirm signal, and waves goodbye to everyone. He announces that he will be in by his midnight  curfew. As the dust settles, Greta sighs and says, "Was that a tornado or what that just went through here?  "

- 8.00 p.m. Having read her Mom's plea for aphone call, Julie gives the folks a ring on the video-phone and chats with Mom, Dad, and Gramps. Mom liked her hair, Dad did not comment, and Gramps wondered if it was perhaps too short.  She  asks  Mom  to  send  her  that  file  on  minority  groups  and  color preferences that the Euro-Americas Learning Network pulled together, noting that it would be useful for the paper she was writing for her socio-ethno course. Julie then gets ready for a fun evening at the laso-disco with  Betty, Pablo, and Rhyne.

11.30 p.m. George, Greta, and Bill finish watching the TBS evening news. George mentions that Jane Edwards looks better than ever, especially  since their holographic fine-tuner was repaired, and that he appreciated  the network's decision to run a half hour of national news prior  to the late show. Greta and George decide to head off to bed and Bill says he will indulge his addiction  to  Jake  Burrows  and  the  New  Night  show.  "Tonight  Jake  is

interviewing Helen Weaver regarding her sponsorship of the Lifelong Learning Bill and I want to see how he turns that into something  humorous," Bill exclaims.

We are going  to leave Greta,  George,  Bill, Julie, and Stan to their  almost frantic  rush  into  the  future.  They  do  appear  to  have  things  under  control, though. Is the story of their lives only fiction or is it possible?  Obviously, it comes  out of our imagination, but we believe  the future  will be  something like  this for us, for  our children, and for our grandchildren  if we want it to be. It is only necessary  to do a little extrapolation  from today's  technology and thinking to come  up with what we have  forecasted.  In many ways, we have even been conservative  about what is possible and even  probable.

There  is no  question  in our  minds,  assuming  we can  avoid  worldwide calamities such as nuclear war and ozone layer depletion, that technological innovations will continue to amaze  us and make  life easier  or at least very interesting. Obviously, we will have to continuously  learn  to cope  with the changes. Lifelong, self-directed learning skills will be even more necessary than today.

The Hammond family used many technological  gadgets for their ongoing learning endeavors, as well  as for  their day-to-day activities. Reading and accessing  information  in their  world took  on  a much  different  flavor  than what  we  may  be  used  to,  but  our  current  world  of  microform  readers, electronic  messaging,  fax  machines,  and  interactive  video  seem  natural precursors  to  what  the  Hammonds  took  for  granted  each  day.  We,  for example,  were in  constant,  almost  daily, communication  via  email  (electronic mail) throughout the writing of this book. Collectively, we communicate weekly with dozens of adult education colleagues throughout North America as well as in many other parts  of the world. This  "instant" communication has  enlarged our  worlds and facilitated learning in a way neither of us could have predicted only a decade  ago when we first  became colleagues.

Many technological innovations also are evolving as devices for facilitating self-direction in learning.  Just as the Hammonds were involved in various forms of computer-mediated learning or electronic networking, many of us working today with the education of adults use similar, although  comparatively  primitive, resources.  Just  think  how  exciting  it  will  be  when  that retrogressive scanning probe system is developed. We can go back and view Lindeman first writing the word "andragogy" (Brookfield, 1984b) or perhaps even Benjamin Franklin's first Junto  meeting.

The Hammonds  also employed a variety of learning techniques each day. Independent  study,  contract  learning, learning-exchange networks,  study groups, traditional classes, internships, and just plain old reading a book all

appeared  to  be  part  of  each  family  member's  attempts  to  cope  with the requirements of daily living. One of the messages we hope we have conveyed in this book  is that all such techniques  are viable  for people  of all ages if employed in caring,  facilitative  ways. In fact, for the Hammonds, lifelong and self-directed learning skills were integral to their daily lives.

One of the messages we also want to portray using the Hammond family is that lifelong physical exercise,  good  eating habits,  and obvious medical advances - the precursors of which are in  place today - are  likely to produce healthy people  with good  minds who normally will live long  and  fruitful lives. As a matter of fact, we could easily have introduced great grandmother or  grandfather Hammond into  the  story  and described  a healthy,  vibrant person. Bill's learning throughout life will become increasingly more viable, we believe, and will continually produce challenges for those of us desiring to promote effective  experiences and resources for the self-directed  learner.

The story of the Hammonds also revealed that a variety of "communities" can  be  expected  in  the  future.  From  Julie's  West  Brunswick  to  Greta's learning exchange groups to George's worldwide electronic classroom, the concept of interrelationships with corresponding  impacts on learning must be addressed by us as we move toward the future. No doubt, most of us have already experienced a widening of our community bases and can recognize the implications for learning, information exchange, and forming new relationships.

As we move toward the type of future described in this chapter -  and  we are optimistic that this will happen -  important decisions  must be made  by leaders at  various levels  of society. Political leaders must find ways  of solving crucial  problems,  such  as  growing  numbers  of  homeless, environmental hazards, and drug abuse. Educational leaders must solve problems of illiteracy, inadequate learning resources, and constantly rising costs. Those of us in  the  trenches  must  find  means  to  meet  ever-increasing  learning needs, continue to carry out research on educational issues, and keep ourselves up to date with ever-growing knowledge. We hope that this book will contribute some encouragement to the efforts  by many concerned  educators of adults who strive every day to help solve local, national, and international problems. In the concluding chapter we will provide some ideas and recommendations that we hope will lead to some solutions.

## 13 Conclusions and recommendations

As  we  have  stressed  throughout  the  previous  chapters,  self-direction  in learning is not merely a current fad. Rather, it is an idea that is clearly rooted in history. In our view, the idea of self-direction,  where individuals assume personal responsibility for their learning, will continue to thrive as we move toward the year 2000 and beyond. As adult educators, each of us needs to take an active role in creating this future. This can be viewed in the  following way:

Regardless of the roles assumed in subsequent years, skill in projecting the future  should be helpful,  because  then it is possible to work toward that future  and even create the situations  we desire. However, ongoing study to understand both the changes we experience  and those we create will always be necessary.

(Hiemstra, 1987b: 11-12)

The intent of this book has thus been to stimulate readers' thinking relative to self-direction,  with the hope and expectation of helping to create a future where  individual initiative by  learners  is  not  only  rewarded, but  is  also expected as a means  for personal growth.  We also anticipate that  our  thoughts will stimulate some of the ongoing study, reflection, and action necessary for the promotion of self-direction in adult learning.

The  Personal Responsibility Orientation  (PRO)  model,  which  was presented in Chapter 2, was designed not as a "theory" of self-direction per se, but rather to demonstrate some of our own reflections on the growing body of related knowledge. We view the model as a paradigm that may assist both practitioners  and scholars in efforts to create greater understanding of, and activity related to, self-direction in adult learning.  In subsequent chapters,  we demonstrated various aspects of the PRO model, and from  these chapters we can identify  at least eight key ideas that should help promote better understanding of the concept:

- 1 The research base on self-direction has grown steadily over the years. We are  confident  that  researchers will  continue  to  build  on  this  base  to advance knowledge of self-direction  even further;
- 2 Essential  to success in facilitating  self-directed  learning  is the need  to help learners assume greater responsibility  for the process. We  believe that learners are capable of assuming increasing degrees of responsibility for their  learning;
- 3  Self-direction is  rooted in the  belief that human potential is unlimited.  We are convinced  that educators of adults can play a role in helping  learners more fully realize  this potential;
- 4  The community provides an array of resources that self-directed learners can  utilize.  Our  view  is  that  an  understanding  of  the  community is important because it is the social  context for self-direction in learning;
- 5  Educators of adults  can use what is known about self-direction to encourage the development of relevant policies at institutional, local, state, and national levels;
- 6  Those  who wish to work with self-directed learners need to understand the  learning  environment and the many kinds of resources  that can be used to facilitate  self-direction;
- 7  We know that self-direction in learning is not exclusive to a single culture or class of people. At the same time, we recognize the need to understand and respect  cross-cultural  differences that may impact upon  the desirability of self-direction in certain contexts; and
- 8  Because of the highly personal nature of self-direction,  the potential for ethical conflict clearly exists whenever intervention takes place.  In our view, it is crucial for educators of adults to recognize the potential for this conflict and be diligent in minimizing any negative results.

We believe the PRO model offers  some  ideas that can assist educators in various ways related to these themes.

## CREATING GREATER AWARENESS OF SELF-DIRECTION

In looking to the future of self-direction in adult learning, perhaps one of the most important considerations  for educators  will be how to create greater awareness of, and support for, the idea of self-direction  within society. In Chapter  8,  for  example, we  addressed  some  of  the  barriers  within  the institutional context that often limit opportunities for self-direction. It is our belief that if self-direction is truly to be recognized  as a way of life, there are at  least  two  key roles  for educators  of  adults. One role  will  be  to provide advocacy  for  learners  who  wish  to  assume  responsibility  for  their  own

## 218 A glance at the future

learning. A second role is to promote the concept of self-direction  in learning throughout society as a strategy for successful human development.

Further, we  believe that self-direction is very much in tune with the natural way that people live and learn. Yet institutions often  lose this perspective, becoming  set  in  their  traditional  policies,  procedures, and philosophies, which in turn lead to a "this is the way we've always done it" or "if it ain't broke,  don't  fix  it"  way  of  thinking.  However,  we believe  self-direction options need not necessarily compromise quality within the institution (Brockett, 1988a).

As  we noted  in  Chapter  2,  the  assumptions  underlying  self-direction derive from a  variety of  philosophical  perspectives. Educators who work with self-directed  learners  need  to understand  these assumptions  and how  their own philosophies  are similar to, or different  from,  these  assumptions.  This is  where  the  importance of  developing  and  articulating  one's  personal philosophy  becomes  so important  (Hiemstra,  1988b).  There  is no  single "theory" of self-direction in learning; yet, there are some key  assumptions that are essential to the support and promotion of the idea.

From our perspective, there is a need to carry out the advocacy  function both within and outside of the adult education field. Within the field, courses and workshops provide a good arena in which to advocate for self-direction. In recent years, we have conducted  a combined  total of six  credit-bearing graduate courses and numerous non-credit workshops and conference presentations directly  related to self-directed learning. For  us, the ideas exchanged  in such  activities have played  an important  role  in  advancing knowledge about self-directed learning concepts, approaches, and problems. Several publications have resulted from these efforts (Hiemstra, 1980,1982b, 1985c) and we believe that we have a much clearer understanding of this area than would have been possible in any other manner. Thus, these efforts have served us well in our role as advocates for  self-direction.

In the classroom we have experimented with various means of employing self-directed  approaches  with  adult  learners.  Although  this  has  been  an evolutionary development of our own personal teaching styles, the feedback we constantly receive from learners  indicates  that we have developed  the means for learners to maximize their abilities to take responsibility  for their learning. We also have shared our accumulating knowledge about applying self-directed  concepts  with colleagues  through  loaning  course  materials, supporting advanced doctoral students in co-teaching  activities, and engaging in oral discussions of the approaches  with colleagues interested in making changes.

As another example of our own advocacy  effort,  we have attempted to contribute to the literature of self-direction in numerous ways. Between us, we  have published separately or jointly over  twenty-five journal articles,

monographs,  book chapters,  and conference  papers on the subject.  These publications, combined  with chairing a large number of related dissertations and theses, and numerous discussions  with informal networks of  colleagues throughout the field who share an interest in this area, have led us toward a growing knowledge of the ideas discussed  in this book and have served to reinforce our own commitment to the study and practice of self-direction in adult learning.  We  hope,  too,  that the ideas  presented  here  can stimulate others in the field to share our continued enthusiasm.

Outside the field of adult education there is a  constant need to demonstrate to  professional colleagues  in education, higher education administrators, and, indeed,  society  in  general,  that  self-direction  in  learning  has  tremendous importance for helping  adult learners  realize  their potential.  For example, some critics from outside the field of adult  education suggest that the  quality of the learning experience will  be compromised if educators, content specialists,  or  institutions do  not  retain  major  control  of  teaching  and  learning decisions.

There  is  thus  a heavy demand on  adult educators  to  demonstrate that quality can be maintained. We have discussed this issue to some extent in Chapter  1 but it is useful  to refer once  again  to the work of Knowles and Associates (1984). They have shown the wide applicability of self-directed learning principles  in an array of settings,  including business  and industry, government,  higher  education,  public  schools,  religious  institutions,  and health-related  settings.  These  illustrations  consistently  show  that  when efforts  are made carefully  to monitor quality issues, self-direction proves to be an effective  approach to learning within various institutional  contexts.

As we have stressed throughout the book, we are convinced  that further understanding of, and commitment  to, the ideals of self-direction in learning are vital to the adult education field if we are to facilitate development of the human potential more fully.  In the following section, we offer  a number of recommendations, gleaned from  ideas presented  in the previous chapters, that we believe are important in the future development of theory, research, and practice relative to self-direction in adult learning.

## RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE FUTURE

How might adult educators work toward further development and  refinement in the area of self-direction? The previous chapters have offered  perspectives on the development and current status of self-direction relative  to theory, research, and practice.  In this section,  we would like to offer  a number of recommendations relative to each of these areas in the hope that they may stimulate questions and experimentation with new ideas designed to ensure

## 220 A glance at the future

that the phenomenon  of self-direction in learning  will continue  to be a way of life  for years to come.

## Recommendations  for theory

The PRO model should be subjected  to critical scrutiny by the adult education field

Our intent in developing  the PRO model was not to offer  a formal theory of self-direction  in  adult learning.  Rather,  the  model  was  designed  to  clarify what we believe to be some of the conceptual  confusion  about self-directed learning and related terms. It is also our way of helping to make distinctions between characteristics of the teaching/learning transaction  and individual learner characteristics. However, we recognize that this is at a basic conceptual  level, so we welcome critical  scrutiny of the concept.  In this way, we envision the PRO model evolving over time, much in the way that Knowles has refined  his ideas about andragogy and pedagogy.

There is a need for further  understanding  of the social context  in which self-direction exists

Because  self-directed learning  rarely takes place in  total  isolation,  understanding of the  social  setting becomes  especially  important.  Discussion  of the various factors  that can  limit participation  and success  in self-directed learning efforts  is only one  way of approaching  an understanding of  social settings. We believe there is room for considerable theoretical work on other social  aspects such as those introduced in Chapter Ten on the global dimension of self-direction.

The political  dimension  of self-direction continues  to be  largely overlooked  by adult educators and this needs to be remedied

One of the major criticisms of the work in self-directed  learning identified by authors such as Brookfield (1984c, 1988) is that it has largely ignored the political contexts in which learning  occurs. While the PRO model begins to address some of these concerns,  we recognize  that much theoretical development  is still needed.  For  instance, we  believe that the notion of empowerment, as reflected in the work of such educators  as Freire  (1970) and institutions such as Highlander  (Adams,  1975),  are closely  tied to the ideas of self-direction.  While we recognize  that the PRO  model may be at odds with those who view society rather than the individual as the point of

Conclusions and recommendations 221

departure for adult education, we also recognize that this dimension needs to be considered  in much greater depth than has been the case to date.

## Recommendations  for research

Self-direction in learning should continue to evolve as one of the  major research directions in the  field  of adult education

While some would suggest that self-direction has been studied extensively, and thus it is time to move on to other areas, we believe that it is crucial for work in this area to continue  and, in fact,  to be expanded  even  further,  A major  limitation of  adult education  research  to date has been  a failure  to develop sustained research  agendas in key areas. Research on self-direction has  laid  an  important  foundation for  our  understanding of  this area. Still, much  work remains to  be  done.  We  are  convinced  of  the  need  for  such continued research because (a) we are just beginning to unlock some very important doors to knowledge and, without further progress, some doors will remain unopened, and (b) because of the work in the area to date, continued research on self-direction can add to the "credibility" and understanding of the completed studies.

Future researchers should continue to approach the study  of self-direction using a variety of research  methodologies

Perhaps one of the major contributions  of research  to date on self-direction has  been  the realization  that  what  we know  about  this  area  has  emerged through  a variety of  research  methods.  By  looking  at  self-direction  from several research perspectives,  it has been possible to construct  a picture of the landscape with much more depth than would be possible by only looking at the area through a single paradigm. We believe that there can be no single "best" way to study self-direction,  and that a key for future research development will be the ability to look at research  problems in innovative ways.

In addition  to continued work with correlational, quasi-experimental, and qualitative designs, we recommend the development of historical  and philosophical investigations to further support the conceptual base of self-direction. Also, we see potential for directing research toward a host of policy questions, such as many of those addressed in Chapter 9.

There is a continuing need for  the refinement  of existing measures of self-direction and the development of alternative instruments

While there have been various criticisms of the primary instruments used to

## 222 A glance at the future

measure self-direction to date (and both of us have at times been among the critics), we applaud the work of Guglielmino and Oddi, for despite limitations that  have  been  reported  relative  to the  Self-Directed Learning  Readiness Scale (SDLRS) and the Oddi Continuing Learning  Inventory (OCLI), without these instruments, and without the willingness of the developers of these measures to take on such a task,  our knowledge  of self-direction  in  adult learning would be set back at least a decade. As a future research  direction, we recommend that efforts  be made to refine existing measures in response to limitations as they are identified. One approach might be the development of alternate forms of the instruments, such as the new version of the SDLRS developed by Guglielmino for adults with low literacy  levels.

Another possibility  might be the development  of new measures of  selfdirection, based on emerging views of the concept. For instance, it might be possible to use the PRO Model as a theoretical basis for such an instrument.

## There is a need for  research on the roles and  functions  of institutions relative to self-direction in adult learning

What kind of role can or should institutions play in support of self-direction in  adult learning? How can institutions  foster greater self-direction  among learners? Are there ways to provide better resources  and to address barriers to  self-direction?  Questions  such  as  these  are  relevant,  not  only  within colleges  and universities, but also within non-higher  education  institutions such as corporate  training departments, health and human service programs, adult basic education programs, and voluntary  agencies.

## An understanding of the role of the instructor is important

In  other  publications  (e.g.,  Brockett  and  Hiemstra,  1985)  and  in  earlier chapters,  we  have  discussed the  role  of  the  instructor from  a  practice perspective.  There  is  also  a  need  to  explore  this  role  from  a  research perspective. Some relevant questions  may include  the following: What are the major responsibilities of the facilitator? How do such factors as teaching style,  interpersonal  trust,  rational  thinking,  cross-cultural  awareness,  and personality influence one's ability to be an effective facilitator of self-direction?

Cross-cultural research could help  to provide a better understanding of certain social and political aspects of self-direction

As we have tried to stress throughout the book, it is crucial to understand the interface  between  self-direction  and  the  social  context  in  which  one  is

operating. There is ample evidence that self-direction  is much more than a "middle-class,  white" phenomenon, Yet it would be equally short-sighted to go to the other extreme and suggest that the ideas underlying self-direction in  adult  learning  are  universally  valued  by  all  cultures.  Research  that approaches  self-direction from  a cross-cultural  perspective  could provide some important insights in this regard.

## It is important to build bridges from  research to practice

Research, in our view,  lies at the core of future developments  in self-direction.  Yet, the  ultimate value of  this research  depends on how  it eventually can be tied to improved practice. This is not to suggest that every research  study  must  have  immediate  and  direct  application  to  practice. Rather, we would argue that what is needed are three types of  researchers: (a) those who conduct basic research aimed at expanding the knowledge  base of self-direction; (b) those who conduct applied research such as evaluation studies, which have direct implications for specific programs and practices; and (c) those who attempt to synthesize the research in such a way that it is possible  to  draw implications  and conclusions  from  the  "big  picture" of research. In large measure, this latter emphasis has been our attempt with  this book.

## Recommendations for practice

## There is a continuing need to promote the use of learning contracts

As we noted in Chapter 6, learning contracts make it possible to  individualize the  teaching-learning process.  This  device  brings  about  a  multitude of possibilities for meeting learners*  needs, provides for a variety of outlets for evaluating learners' experiences, and aids planning by eliciting choices about scheduling, resources, learning strategies,  and outcomes.  It even permits a very structured  route through a learning experience for those who desire such structure.

From our experience in more formal settings, it is also very important that any communication between the learner and facilitator be clear. We believe contracts  are an ideal means for promoting such clarity. We would suggest, too,  that  contracts  are  useful  mechanisms  to  aid people  in planning  their learning outside of the formal  institutional  setting.  In other  words, such a device becomes a personal tool for thinking about goals, identifying resources,  facilitating  time  management, and building commitment to complete learning  endeavors.

## 224 A glance at the future

## It  is important to help  learners identify and utilize a variety of resources

Much of the research cited in earlier chapters about adults* learning projects and learning activities has consistently shown that self-directed  learners use a wide variety of resources.  Thus, as facilitators aid learners  in becoming comfortable and more proficient with self-directed activities, it is crucial that help in locating and using resources  be provided. Facilitators  can provide reading  lists, locate  available learning  materials,  and collect  a variety of institutional or instructor-owned materials for loan to learners. They can also guide learners in identifying support services in the local community. Chapter 8  provided several ideas on how to find and  use various learning resources, but  we believe  that future  attempts to help  learners  be more  efficient  and effective  in the actual use of resources  are warranted.

## The potential of networking for  and among self-directed learners needs to be more  fully  explored,  understood, and  exploited

Considerable discussion  of networking has taken place in the past few years. Much of this discussion has centered on networks of people  built around common needs, concerns, or interests, for example, professional networks, informal hobby-related networks, and  networks devoted to specialized populations such  as  women's  support  groups. However,  Fingeret's (1983) impressive work with the social networking activities of illiterate adults and the various efforts  to promote  learning  exchange  networks  in the United States  (Draves,  1980;  Lewis,  1978,  Perkins, 1985a,  1985b)  suggest  the potential value of networks for adult learners. The future certainly needs to include practical efforts  aimed at initiating various learning networks.

There is a continuing need to help  educators better understand the impact they can have on learner  self-direction

Schuttenberg and Tracy (1987) suggest that educators must play the following  roles  if  they are to foster self-directed learning:  leadership,  direction, collaboration,  coaching,  modeling,  and  being  a  colleague.  We  can  add several more roles from our experience, such as mentoring, locating resources, serving as a validator  of learning, and building confidence in personal abilities. There are obvious overlaps in the above roles, and other roles have, no  doubt,  been  overlooked.  However,  the  point  is  that  in  situations of facilitating  self-direction in  learning, educators have a number of  crucial roles to play.

We believe, though, that this  importance  and  the  resulting  impact  on learners is not very well understood. As we noted in Chapter 1, in our  attempt

to address some of the myths regarding self-direction  in learning,  facilitating such  learning  is  not  easy  for  most  educators.  It  requires  lots  of  work, considerable advance planning, and a faith in the inherent ability of learners to take charge of their own learning, It is thus imperative that adult educators who are interested in self-directed  learning  foster the type of training that will help teachers understand the impact they do have on learners* abilities to accept personal responsibility  for their educational  activities.

It  is important to be cognizant of cross-cultural differences that may influence  the impact and perceived value of self-direction  among learners from  different cultures

We have found  that many international  students and, sometimes, students from  different  cultural groups  within  the  United  States  have  some  initial difficulties  with our self-directed approaches. These difficulties  often match those experienced by Alice in the first chapter. Most initial problems seem to be related to expectations that the instructor will play a very directive role or to alack of confidence in personal abilities to assume major responsibility for  the planning and evaluation of learning experiences.

Thus, there is a  need to provide appropriate orientation to such individuals very early in the learning experience.  This should involve such activities as special  meetings outside of the classroom, pairing such people with others who have been involved in self-directed  learning at prior times for in-class small group sessions,  and careful communication  about processes, learning expectations, available resources,  and assuming individual responsibility. In our own courses  and workshops, for example, we take great care in developing  the  written materials explaining  the teaching  and learning  process, providing samples of devices like learning contracts,  and looking  for nonverbal frustration  or confusion clues. Even given such measures, some initial problems are natural and will need to be dealt with on a case-by-case  basis.

There is a need to help facilitators  learn how to  foster  self-direction  with large groups as well as with individuals in small groups

It  has  been  our experience that large group  size need not  deter the use of self-direction  in learning approaches.  However, it will necessitate  working with  such  groups  in  ways  different from  a  typical  lecture  format.  One suggestion we have is to break such  large groups  into smaller groups for portions  of the formal sessions. This can be accomplished  in several ways. We have had success with the following three techniques: (a) forming  groups of two to six people who move their seats together, (b) by having some people turn their front  row seats to work with people in back row seats, and (c) if

## 226 A glance at the future

the initial room has fixed  seats or is an auditorium with increasing tiers of seats to the back of the room, by moving people to folding chairs in any open areas of the room or to different breakout rooms.

We also  continue  to use  learning  contracts  with large  groups,  and we encourage students to use study  groups frequently, to form learning networks or support  groups,  and to work together in other ways in developing  and carrying out learning contract activities. Instructors will need to be available for  individual  meetings  and  consultations,  but  a  larger  group  obviously means  that  more  time  will  be  required  outside  the  classroom for  such meetings. We have had considerable  success in the past  few years using electronic mail for communications outside the classroom. Large numbers of people can be accommodated this way in reasonable  amounts of time.

For adult education college  professors,  it is important to work with faculty in and out of colleges of education who may be interested in  self-directed approaches,  but who have little past experience with it

Many such people, especially  if they have not received  professional  adult education training, will experience  initial doubts about the value of self-directed learning for both students and teachers. In essence, many of the myths described in Chapter 1  will be operating  consciously  or sub-consciously  as they attempt intellectually  to understand self-directed  approaches,  learning contracts, and the risks or benefits in giving learners increased responsibility. Modeling, testimonials from students, and in-service workshops are some of the  techniques  we have  employed  in helping  colleagues  learn  about  our approach. We have used all of these approaches  in settings  involving  both new and experienced faculty members and have generally been pleased with the response. The task is  not easy and the result will  not always be successful, but we urge that the effort be made.

It is important for  instructors  to help  administrators  understand why  they are employing  self-directed approaches  and how they can be integrated into the existing system

In previous chapters,  we discussed  some of the changes  necessary  for the self-directed  learning process to be successful,  such as how resources are utilized,  how  evaluation procedures  differ  from  more  traditional  grading approaches, and how time-bound bureaucratic policies may need alterations. However,  it  is  important  to  stress  once  again  the  importance  of  helping administrators, who impact on teaching in various ways, to understand the value  and  appropriateness  of  the  facilitative  processes.  Often,  it  will  be necessary to describe or defend  changes that will facilitate greater

opportunity  for  self-direction,  such  as alternative  residency requirements, new  uses  of  learning  contracts  or  field  placements,  and  increased  use  of independent study activities.

Promoting  such an understanding  generally  is not an easy  task because policy and procedures have been established to foster smooth  administrative operations, and the educator's approaches may necessitate changes or anomalies such as a heavy use of grading incompletes, staggered registrations, and grade changes  after  supplemental work by learners. It is our belief, though, that the constant defending and describing  is worth the effort because  of the enhancements possible  for learners.  In addition, they discover  and build on their individual learning  potential.

Finally,  we believe that there is a great need for  adult educators to become more active in popularizing  and promoting  notions of self-direction in learning throughout society

We recognize that by and large in writing this book  we are preaching  to the converted. Certainly we hope  that we can convince  many people  currently not  aware  of  all  aspects  of  working  with self-directed  individuals of  the potential of the approaches advocated in the book. However, because we are so convinced of the value of helping people take responsibility for their own learning  -  not  only  for  those  involved  in  more  formalized  educational pursuits but  also  for those  who constantly  need  to cope  with life's  many changes -  we think it important to find ways of reaching the unconverted.

Thus, we urge that adult educators  carry out various  activities  that will promote self-direction in learning throughout society.  This can include such actions as writing about one's approaches  for the popular literature, facilitating workshops on self-direction in institutions such  as libraries,  museums, and  art galleries,  and  spreading  the  messages  to various  audiences  with a missionary  zeal.  Efforts  like  these  will  require  work  outside  our  normal responsibilities, but we do believe the potential impact throughout society is worth it.

## CONCLUSION

This book has been written for a broad  audience. We have tried to present a wide range of strategies, ideas, and issues and hope that they have been useful in stimulating  those who want to improve or enhance their efforts in working with self-directed learners. We also have tried to present a "state of the  art" look  at theory  and research.  We recognize  that our own perspectives  have limited the social  context  in which we have examined the self-direction in learning phenomenon. Nonetheless, we have attempted to provide as broad

## 228 A glance at the future

a perspective  as possible  by sharing information on such diverse areas as literature relative to the "middle class phenomenon,"  the global  aspects of self-direction, and even some likely future scenarios for adult learners.

Ultimately, what  we  believe we  have  done is  to raise a  number of questions for  future  examination of self-direction in learning, We hope that the PRO model will  serve  as  a conceptual  device to  stimulate future  dialogue and investigation. And we hope that the many implications we have identified and  described in the book  will  stimulate research  by colleagues  in North America and the world.

This book is actually  a  culmination of several years  of our research, study, scholarship, and direction of graduate student colleagues' research  efforts. As  such, we  see  this not  as  an end  of  our  agendas,  but  rather,  as  a  new beginning. We  anticipate involvement in new research  directions, expect expanded  concern  for  the  global  perspective  of  self-direction,  and desire opportunities to try new practices relative to self-direction. Thus, for us the odyssey continues.

## Appendix A

Annotated bibliography of sources related to andragogy*

As has been pointed out throughout the various chapters of the book, our view of self-direction in adult learning is intimately linked to the concept of andragogy. This  appendix is designed  to be  a resource  for  those  readers seeking a greater understanding of what has been written about andragogy. Sources are presented in alphabetical order and cover the years 1927  through 1989.  A brief annotation is provided for each reference.

## SOURCES

Anderson, M. L., and Lindeman, E. C. (1927). Education through experience. New York: Workers Education Bureau.

In this work the authors provide an  interpretative translation  of literature describing the folk high school system in Germany. They include a section entitled, "Andragogy, " and  describe some teaching methods used by the folk high school teachers. Anderson's role was primarily  that of translator because  much of their  source material was in German.

Beder, H., and Carrea, N. (1988). The effects of andragogical teacher training on  adult students' attendance and evaluation of their teachers. Adult Education Quarterly, 38, 75-87.

The authors examine two hypotheses with an experimental design: (a) andragogically trained teachers of adults will have higher rates of student attendance in their classes than teachers not trained in andragogy and (b) students will evaluate  more positively andragogically-trained adult  education teachers than  teachers not trained in andragogy. The treatment was found to have a positive effect on attendance but not on student evaluations.

He suggests that there are commonalities between the two authors' concepts. For example, both  assert  that their theories  are separate  and distinct from traditional education.  In  addition,  humanism is  somewhat  foundational  to  both  concepts. Rogers comes at his ideas from a psychotherapy  background  and tends to be more individual and small-group oriented. He emphasizes interpersonal and small-group dynamics.  Knowles'  experience  base  is  in  informal  and  continuing education programs  and  tends  to  be  more  supportive  of  group  and  larger organizational perspectives.  He emphasizes program  development.

In  tracing  some  of  the  contributions  of  Lindeman,  Brookfield  points  out  that Lindeman, who undertook (with Martha Anderson) an interpretative translation of the  folk  high school  in Germany, first  used  the term "Andragogy" in their  1927 monograph, Education  Through  Experience.

Brookfield, S. D. (1986). Understanding  and facilitating  adult learning. San Francisco:  Jossey-Bass.

Brookfield  presents  an  entire  chapter  describing  and  analyzing andragogy,  in which he delineates  various authors who have in some way evaluated or critiqued andragogy. He also presents several case studies of andragogy in practice.

Brookfield, S. D. (1987). Learning democracy: Eduard Lindeman on adult  education and social change. Wolfeboro, New Hampshire: Croom Helm.

Brookfield pulls together a number of Lindeman's writings  and adds some synthesizing chapters.  He  includes material from the Anderson  and  Lindeman (1927) discussion of andragogy  and  speculates as to how  Lindeman's interpretation of andragogy might have influenced his later  writings.

Brown, H. W. (1985).  Lateral  thinking and andragogy:  Improving problem solving in  adulthood. Lifelong learning:  An  Omnibus  of  Practice  and  Research, 8(1) 22-25.

Lateral  thinking, also referred to as synectics, creative thinking, and conceptualization, is defined  as a restructuring  of the knowledge  a person  already has to bring about  new  ideas  and  insights.  The  author  suggests  that lateral  thinking can  be incorporated  into the andragogical  process  as a mechanism to promote problemsolving  abilities.

Candy, P. C. (1981). Mirrors  of the mind: Personal  construct  theory in the training of adult educators. Manchester Monographs 16. Manchester: Department  of Adult and Higher Education, University of Manchester.

He  places  andragogy  within  what  he  calls  the  principle  of  self-direction. He compares Knowles to George Kelly, a psychologist, who suggested that  interpretation of the future is what drives a person  to seek knowledge.

Carlson, R. A. (1979). The time of andragogy. Adult Education,  30, 53-57.

He suggests that Elias'  attack  on andragogy  does not give much credence  to the notions of or possibilities for adult self-directed  learning.  He supports  the notion

of facilitating  the capable  adult learner. He further feels that both a  philosophical and political  meaning for andragogy must be  developed.

The researcher developed the scale for this study, designed to measure the purpose of education, nature of learners, characteristics  of learning experience, management of learning experience,  evaluation, and relationships of educator to learners and among learners. The instrument was adapted from work by Hadley and Kerwin (annotated in this bibliography). Military subjects were shown to be less pedagogical than civilians.

They talk about all the efforts to label instruction of various groups of individuals by some sort of  "gogy."  They suggest that the distinctions between various groups are not great enough to warrant  a label and certainly not great enough to talk about there being, or the  need for, a  related theory.  They believe that  appropriate  program development principles are what is important.

Cross,  K. P. (1981). Adults as learners. San Francisco: Jossey-Bass.

Cross  presents  her views on the strengths  and weaknesses  of the  andragogical concept. She believes it is closer to a theory of teaching than to a theory of learning.

The  authors  describe  the  debate  and  dialogue  that  have  developed  regarding andragogy during the past several years, including some of the dissertations on the subject. Considerable  space is devoted to the debate in Adult Education that was held over a period of several years and to the various "gogy" terms that have been developed.  They suggest that it is time we move beyond debate to research.

In this article the authors point out that not only did Lindeman (and Anderson) first introduce  the term "andragogy" in American educational  literature, the work of Lindeman appears  to have played  an important foundational role in Knowles's development of andragogical principles  and process  elements. They suggest that Lindeman should be seen as the spiritual father  and  Knowles  as the protective father who popularized  the term.

The authors criticize  the "andragogy" notion and suggest that andragogy is not a theory of adult learning, but is an educational ideology rooted in an inquiry-based learning  and  teaching  paradigm.  They  believe  that  Knowles's  conception  of pedagogy has been incorrectly  conceived.

Elias, J. L. (1979). Andragogy revisited. Adult Education,  29, 252-255.

Elias takes the  view that  the  promoters and  defenders of  andragogy have  not proven their case and that there is no sound basis for a distinction between andragogy and pedagogy.  He also  feels  that  the  slogan  "andragogy,  not  pedagogy"  is  a well intentioned, but inadequate,  attempt to enhance  the professionalization  of adult education. He suggests that andragogy and pedagogy merely represent two different approaches to the education of children and adults.

Elias, J. L., and Merriam, S. (1980). Philosophical foundations  of adult education. Huntington, NY: Robert E. Krieger Publishing Company.

They place Knowles into a grouping labeled "humanistic adult educators." They suggest  that andragogy is basically  a humanistic theoretical  framework  applied primarily to adult education.

Fisher, J. C., and Podeschi, R. L. (1989). From Lindeman to Knowles: A change in vision. InternationalJournal  of Lifelong  Education, 8, 345-353.

The article compares Knowles and  Lindeman in  relationship to the  primary  purpose of adult education. They conclude  that Knowles and Lindeman are quite different in terms of the process of learning  which each espouses. They believe Knowles' focus  is on the effectiveness of individual means and initiative, whereas Lindeman 's  stress  was on  social  commitment and  the  importance  of  understanding learning within a social context.

The Educational  Orientation  Questionnaire  and Educational  Orientation  Scales (see  Hadley)  were  used  in  this  study. Female  faculty,  faculty  in  the  pastoral ministries,  and faculty  in the religious  education  areas were significantly more andragogically-oriented. Female and younger students were also more andragogically-oriented.

## 234 Appendix  A

characteristics  of learning experience, management of learning experience, evaluation,  and  relationships  of educator  to learners  and among learners.  A  second instrument,  "Educational  Orientation  Scales,"  with six bipolar  measures, was designed  to examine predictive validity of the first instrument. A factor analysis determined eight factors, including pedagogical orientation, andragogical orientation, and self-directed change among them.

The Educational  Orientation  Questionnaire  was utilized with selected  faculty teaching at least 25 percent of the time. There was a significant difference among departments, by sex, by the time spent off-campus working on extension  or service projects, and by the number of years of teaching experience in higher education.

Katz, E. A. (1976). The belief in  andragogy and the development of self-actualization. (Doctoral  dissertation,  Boston University). Dissertation Abstracts  International, 36,7129*.

This study was designed to determine whether extrinsic learning (belief in andragogy) or intrinsic learning (development of self-actualization) do occur in the  same learning experience.  The purpose  was to investigate whether a particular andragogical process of teaching was effective in the growth of participants' beliefs in andragogy and in their development of self-actualization.  The Educational Orientation Questionnaire was utilized. Belief in andragogy increased throughout the learning experiences but the development of self-actualization did not increase.

The relationship  of selected factors to the educational orientation of andragogically-and pedagogically-oriented educators teaching in four of North Carolina's two-year colleges. (Doctoral dissertation, North Carolina State University). Dissertation  Abstracts  International, 40, 0610a.

The study's purpose was to determine if students perceived  differences between the  teaching  behavior  of andragogically-and  pedagogically-oriented  educators. The Educational Orientation Questionnaire was adapted and used to determine the two groups of educators  and to determine student types. Students of andragogically-oriented educators perceived  that their instructors provided  more student involvement and counseling  and less  control  over  their class  than students of pedagogically-oriented educators did for theirs. Andragogically-oriented

## 236 Appendix  A

educators  tended  to be women and to be in general  educational  programs  (rather than in vocational programs).

Kerwin, M. A. (1981). Andragogy in the community college. Community  College Review, 9(3),  12-14.

Kerwin describes how andragogical techniques were used in a community college communications  course.  He designed  a questionnaire  that measures a  student's perceptions  of an instructor's behavior. The instrument was used before and after the educational  experience  in order to help students think about their own role as teachers.

Knowles, M. S. (1968a). Androgogy, not pedagogy! Adult Leadership, 76, 350-352, 386.

In accepting  the Delbert Clark Award in 1967, Knowles laid out his androgogical (as  he  spelled  it  then)  concepts. He  refers  to  it  as  a  technology, introduces self-concept  of the adult, experience  of the adult, time perspective, and problem centered education as differentiating factors, and suggests some of the technological (teaching)  implications -  such as climate, needs diagnosis, planning process, mutual self-directed  inquiry, and evaluation.

Knowles,  M.  S. (1968b). How andragogy  works in leadership training in the girl scouts. Adult Leadership,  17, 161-162, 190-194.

Knowles describes how he tested the andragogical  concepts  with a leader training program for the Girl Scouts program. This case study  report outlines  the steps used and gives an analysis of the final results.

Knowles,  M.  S.  (1970). Modern  practice  of  adult  education:  Andragogy  versus pedagogy. Chicago: Follett Publishing Company, Association  Press.

In this first version  of the book, Knowles lays out the premise of andragogy as an art and science of teaching adults as opposed to what is used to teach children. The book  initiated  lots  of  debate, dialogue,  and  change  in  terms  of instructional approaches.

Knowles,  M.  S.  (1973). The  adult  learner:  A  neglected  species. Houston:  Gulf Publishing  Company.

In a presentation  of various learning  theories  and teaching  approaches,  Knowles slots in the andragogical  model.

Knowles, M. (1975). Self-directed learning. New York: Association Press.

Although andragogy is mentioned only a very few times in this little book, Knowles actually is utilizing his andragogical  principles and process  elements as guides in developing the various inquiry  projects and  learning resource suggestions throughout.

Knowles, M. (1979). Andragogy  revisited: Part II. Adult Education, 30, 52-53.

Knowles suggests  that he made a mistake in subtitling Modern Practice of  Adult Education as "Andragogy  versus Pedagogy." He suggests that the title should have been "From  Pedagogy  to Andragogy" and that his assumptions should have been presented  on a continuum. However, he feels that some service  came out of the dialogue and debate that was established. A caveat is presented: That an ideological

pedagogue  would  want  to  keep  a  learner  dependent  throughout  the  learning situation  whereas  a  true  andragogue  would  want to  do everything possible  to provide  the  learner  with  whatever  foundational  content  was  needed  and  then encourage a self-directed process of further inquiry.

Knowles,  M.  S.  (1980). Modern practice  of  adult  education: From pedagogy  to andragogy. Revised and updated. Chicago: Follett Publishing  Company, Association Press.

In this revised edition, Knowles  recognizes the considerable debate that took place since the 1970 version was published and approaches andragogy as an  alternative teaching and learning approach, albeit one  relying on the fact that  adults  are  capable of  self-directed  learning,  as are many youth. He also understands that a person utilizing andragogy as an approach will attempt  to move  the learner to independent learning as quickly as possible.

Knowles, M. (1984). The adult learner:  A neglected species. (3rd ed.), Houston: Gulf Publishing.

In this book Knowles discusses within two different chapters, andragogy in terms of a review of his organizing concepts,  teaching, and publication, and the use of andragogy in HRD settings.

Knowles,  M.  S.,  and  associates  (1984). Andragogy  in  action: Applying modern principles  of adult learning. San Francisco: Jossey-Bass.

This book is made up of two chapters by Knowles (introduction and conclusion) and seven other chapters  (grouped  according  to institutional settings) containing thirty-six  selections written  by fifty-two authors,  five organizational  representatives, and some "associates". The various selections are case study  reports of how andragogy (or some variations of it) has been used.

Knowles,  M.  S.  (1989). The  making  of  an  adult  educator: An  autobiographical journey. San Francisco: Jossey-Bass.

In this autobiography, Knowles traces his career and the development  of his ideas. Of particular interest to readers seeking information on andragogy is a chapter on how Knowles' ideas have evolved over the years. Here, he presents his current conceptualization  of  six  assumptions  comprising  the  andragogical  model  and includes a discussion on some of the writers who have influenced his thinking in recent years.

Knudson, R. S. (1979). Humanagogy anyone? Adult Education, 29, 261-264.

Knudson promotes humanagogy as a theory of learning that takes into account the differences between people of various  ages as well as their similarities. It is a  human theory of learning as opposed to a theory of child, adult, or elderly learning. The accumulation of experience,  for example, is a lifelong process  that needs to be considered  in educational planning.

Knudson, R. S. (1980). An alternative approach to the andragogy/pedagogy issue. Lifelong  Learning: The Adult Years, 5(8), 8-10.

Knudson suggests that rather than  argue  the strengths  and weaknesses  of  andragogy or pedagogy  based on assumptions about whether or not adults and children are different, we  use  a  law  of  identity  (defining  what  is  meant by  being  a  child

## 238 Appendix A

independent  of what is meant by being an adult) and a theory of emergence (we emerge  into  adulthood  based  on experiences  we had as a child).  He suggests, therefore,  that "humanagogy" replace both pedagogy  and andragogy. He likens this to a "holistic" approach to adult education.

Komisin, L., and Gogniat, D. (1987). Andragogy, adult expectations,  and international programs. Continuing Higher Education, 35(1), 13-15.

The authors describe how andragogical concepts  were used to develop  international field-based  experiences.

This "international" piece is referenced  here just to note that there  is literature available from throughout the world related to the word or notion of andragogy.

Lebel, J. (1978). Bey  ond andragogy to  gerogogy. Lifelong  Learning:  The  Adult Years, 7(9), 16-18, 24-25.

Lebel suggests the existence  of sufficient  data supporting the need for gerogogy and advocated  that it should be studied as a theory. He suggests, further,  that the concepts  imbued within andragogy may be appropriate only up to certain  stages of development  chronologically.

Lewis, L.  H. (1987). [Review of  Modern practice of  adult  education: Andragogy versus pedagogy]. Adult Education Quarterly, 37, 120-122.

A retrospective  review of the book presented  in a special book review feature of historical landmarks for the field of adult education.

Lindeman, E.  C.  (1926). Andragogik:  The  method  of  teaching  adults. Worker's Education, 4, 38.

This is the first known use of the term andragogy in North American literature. Lindeman, in a one-paragraph article, described how Professor Eugen Rosenstock of the Frankfurt Academy of Labor coined a  new word: Andragogik. He mentioned that  andragogy is the true  method by which  adults  keep themselves intelligent about the modem world.

London,  J.  (1973).  Adult  education  for  the  1970's:  Promise  or  illusion? Adult Education, 24, 60-70.

In this essay review of  Modern Practice of Adult Education, London talks about some of the roles adult educators  might play in the 1970s. However, he suggests that Knowles' book is largely a technical book which conveys a  kind of technicism in referring to adult educators.  He describes  a problem with the 1970 version in that there is not an effective  way of translating the author's  discussion  into any kind of effective  analysis of how adult educators  can utilize  the presentation of needs into programming which will help adults confront various critical problems facing society.  He feels that we need more than just methods and techniques to really  help  adult  educators  confront  some of the  major  issues  of our time. He believes we may need more radical approaches to educating adults, rather than the "sameness" of die technology implied in Knowles' book.

McCullough, K. O. (1978). Andragogy and community problem solving. Lifelong Learning: The Adult Years, 2(2), 8-9,31.

McCullough describes andragogy as a process,  a science of teaching  adults, and as  a  profession.  He  says  that  the  andragogist  believes  that  knowledge  is  the equalizing  factor among people  and that people  can come to "know" enough through an andragogical process to be a part of community problem-solving.

McKenzie, L. (1977). The issue of andragogy. Adult Education, 27, 225-229.

Utilizing an Aristotelian approach (classical), a phenomenological approach, and two syllogies, McKenzie provides some philosophical  support for andragogy.

McKenzie, L. (1979). A response to Elias. Adult Education, 29,256-260.

McKenzie maintains that adults and children are cardinally different by virtue of different  modes of being-in-the-world, that adults and children exhibit different modes of existing, that these modes may be identified through phenomenological analysis, and that the existential differences between adults and children require a strategic differentiation of educational practice. He maintains  a  notion that  Knowles's contrast between andragogy and pedagogy remains a useful but initial effort to explicate an approach to education that is related specifically to adult life.

McTernan, E. J. (1974). Androgogical education in the  health services. Adult Leadership, 23, 136,148.

McTeman provides a description  of how some principles of adult education were utilized in instituting a new master's degree program in the health services area. He concludes with the notion that their attempt might be a promising model for the reconciliation  of andragogy and pedagogy.

Merriam, S. B. (1987). Adult  learning and theory building:  A review. Adult Education Quarterly, 37, 187-198.

Merriam presents  an assessment  and  analysis of  the literature related to adult learning, and describes andragogy as a  "theory"  based on adult  characteristics. She also presents a summary of some of the criticism that andragogy as a theory area has received.

Merriam, S. B. (1988). Finding your way through the maze: A guide to the literature on adult  learning. Lifelong  Learning:  An Omnibus of Practice and Research,  J1 (6), 4-7.

Merriam presents  some guidelines  and ideas  for organizing the  adult learning literature to aid  one's selection and  reading. Andragogy is  presented and described in the article as one of several theories that attempts to explain the phenomenon  of adult learning.

Meyer, S. (1977). Andragogy and the aging adult learner. Educational Gerontology, 2(2), 115-122.

This article identifies  the basic concepts and structures  of  pedagogy and  andragogy as teaching-learning strategies for aging adults.  Andragogy is depicted as  a  relevant participatory adult education technique useful for aging  adults.

Mezirow, J. (1981). A  critical theory of adult learning  and education. Adult Education, 32, 3-24.

## 240 Appendix A

Mezirow presents what he calls a charter for andragogy, and suggests that andragogy, "as  a professional  perspective  of adult educators,  must be defined as an organized and sustained effort to assist adults to learn in a way that enhances their capability to function as self-directed  laymen." He  presents  12 actions he believes adult educators must carry  out.

Newton, E. S. (1970). Andragogy: Understanding the adult as learner. Journal of Reading, 20, 361-363.

Newton believes that the curriculum should be timed to be in step with developmental tasks as the individual encounters  them, in order to make full  use of the teachable  moment. The requirements  and demands of the present  situation and aspiring roles in real life must dominate and supersede all other considerations in andragogy.

Nottingham Andragogy Group. (1983). Toward  a developmental  theory  of andragogy. (Adults: Psychological  and Educational Perspective  No. 9). Nottingham, England: Department of Adult Education, University of  Nottingham.

The Nottingham group has somewhat reinterpreted Knowles's andragogical  concepts in terms of their beliefs about adults and adults' abilities to think creatively and critically in learning settings. The booklet provides descriptions  of methods, several  features of a teaching  and learning process, and some stages of course development centered around theirnotions about critical thinking.  The  Nottingham group also report that they believe that Alexander Kapp, a German teacher, first used the word andragogy in 1833  to describe the educational theory of Plato.

The authors drew upon available literature to delineate  a counseling  procedure consistent with andragogical  principles  and a life span development perspective. They then examined the effects of implementing such procedures and determined that people can be helped  to enhance  their  own problem  solving abilities and self-confidence.

Peterson,  D.  A.  (1983). Facilitating education for  older  adults. San  Francisco: Jossey-Bass.

Peterson describes andragogy in context with  older learners. He suggests where  an understanding  of older  adults  as  learners  intersects  with various  andragogical concepts. He also suggests ways in which andragogy can be applied with older learners.

Podeschi, R. (1987b). Lindeman, Knowles and American  individualism. Proceedings

of'theTwenty-eighthAnnualAdultEducationResearchConference(pp. 195-200). Laramie, WY: University of Wyoming, Conferences and Institutes.

In analyzing these two individuals, Podeschi suggests that Lindeman's andragogy is related philosophically  to republican individualism, whereas Knowles *s andragogy is connected  sociologically to utilitarian individualism.

Podeschi, R. L., and Pearson, E. M. (1986). Knowles  and Maslow: Differences about freedom. Lifelong  Learning: An Omnibus of Practice and Research, 9 (7), 16-18.

The authors talk about Knowles's updated views of freedom and  self-directed learning in his more recent writings about andragogy. They suggest that  Knowles is  perhaps overly dependent on the ability  of all  people to accept individual freedom in  learning.

Pratt, D. D. (1984). Andragogical assumptions: Some counter intuitive logic. Proceedings of the  Twenty-fifth Annual Adult Education Research Conference (pp. 147-153). Syracuse, NY: Printing Services, Syracuse University.

Pratt reviews the evolution of the concept of andragogy and examines some of the distortions  and assumptions that have emerged. Two andragogical assumptions (adults  as self-directed  learners  and  shared  authority for decision-making)  are examined.

Pratt, D. D. (1988). Andragogy as a relational construct Adult Education Quarterly, 38, 160-171.

The author suggests that andragogical practice should acknowledge and accept of its learners both self-directedness and its obverse, dependency. Several learner and teacher variables are described  and some figures depicting relationships are provided.

Rachal,  J.  (1983).  The  andragogy-pedagogy  debate:  Another voice  in  the  fray. Lifelong  Learning: The Adult Years, 6(9), 14-15.

Rachal suggests that adult educators may have  become too engrossed in the field's jargon and utilizes "andragogy" as a discussion term. He notes how concepts like "self-directed learning"  have  spun  off from the  philosophical underpinnings related to andragogy.

Savicevic, D. M. (1981). Adult education systems in European Socialist  countries: Similarities  and differences. In A. N. Charters  and associates, Comparing  adult education worldwide. San  Francisco: Jossey-Bass.

The author introduces the  reader to  the  term "anthropogogy"  - a  term that Hungary utilizes  to cover both andragogy and pedagogy.  He also describes  how various other countries in this region use some form of andragogy.

The author  describes collaborative learning and  cooperative learning efforts among students that is reported to be gaining wide acceptance in higher education today. Collaborative learning is purported to parallel andragogical procedures  in many ways.

Stewart, D. W. (1986). Perspective. Lifelong  Learning:  An Omnibus of Practice and Research, 9(5), 2.

Stewart provides some suggestions as to why Anderson and Lindeman did not use the term "andragogy" after their mention of it in  1927.

Stewart, D. W. (1987). Adult learning in  America:  Eduard Lindeman  and his agenda for  lifelong  education. Malabar, Florida: Robert E. Krieger Publishing Company.

Stewart writes a masterful biography of Eduard Lindeman, considered by many in the United States as the father of scholarly work in adult education. Chapter  8, entitled "What Adult Education Means: Discovering and Rediscovering the Concept  of  Andragogy," describes the  interconnectedness  between  Lindeman's thinking about adult education and much of what andragogy has come to represent. He traces the history of Lindeman's use of the term andragogy in 1926 and 1927.

Suanmali, C. (1982). The core concepts  of andragogy. (Doctoral  dissertation, Teachers  College,  Columbia University). Dissertation  Abstracts International,  42, 4471a.

Utilizing the  charter for andragogy outlined by  Jack Mezirow, Suanmali developed an "Andragogy in Practice Inventory" and administered it to a group of adult education professors. He believes  that there is a consensus regarding  the  major concepts used in the andragogical  process.

Tennant, M. (1986). An evaluation of Knowles's theory of adult learning. InternationalJournal  of Lifelong  Education, 6, 113-122.

Tennant discusses  and evaluates a number of themes which persist explicitly or implicitly throughout  Knowles's writings,  including  the concept of self-actualization,

the difference between child and adult learners, and the clinical model  influence of Carl Rogers and Abraham Maslow. He argues for a clearer articulation of several underlying  tenets and takes issue with the notion that adult learning  is different from child learning.

Terry, E. F. (1988). Using andragogy to foster moral development of adults within the institutional church. Lifelong  Learning:  An Omnibus of Practice and Research, 72(2), 4-6.

The author believes  that the nature of andragogy  is such that it can provide an appropriate vehicle for facilitating moral development within  a church setting. She relates andragogical process elements closely with the process required for movement throughout  the various  stages  of  moral development. The  importance  of facilitation is described.

Thorne, E. H., and Marshall, J. L. (1985). Managerial-skills development: An experience in program design. Personnel Journal, 55(1), 15-17, 38.

The authors describe how andragogy can be adapted to an industrial setting. They describe how to create an environment in which a management skills development program can operate.

Thornton,  J. A. (1973).  [Review of Mo dern practice of adult education: Andragogy versus pedagogy].  Adult Education, 24, 70-72.

A fairly straightforward and positive review of the book.

Travis, A. Y. (1985). Andragogy and the disabled adult learner. Lifelong Learning: An Omnibus of Practice and Research, 5(8), 16-18, 20.

The author suggests how andragogical principles could be utilized with disabled adult learners. Several descriptive tables are included.

Warren, C. (1989). Andragogy andN. F. S. Grundtvig: A critical link. Adult Education Quarterly, 59(4), 211-223.

Warren compares the ideas of N. F. S. Grundtvig with those of various American adult education thinkers, particularly as those thinkers have addressed the concept of andragogy. Warren suggests that while Grundtvig has basically gone unread in North America, his ideas  have had a major influence on adult education in this context, largely due to the legacy of Eduard Lindeman. He suggests that the basic ideas of Grundtvig essentially parallel Knowles's assumptions of andragogy.

Yeo, G. (1982). 'Eldergogy' a specialized  approach to education for elders. Lifelong Learning: The Adult Years, 5(5), 4-7.

She recommends a new "gogy, "  eldergogy, defined as a specialized approach to education  for elders.  She believes  that eldergogy  would help teachers of  older adults  to become  more  effective.  She provides a number of instruction-related strategies.

Yonge, A. D. (1985). Andragogy and pedagogy: Two ways of accompaniment. Adult Education Quarterly, 35, 160-167,

In this article, Yonge talks about how discussions  of andragogy revolving around learning and teaching are both necessary and confusing. Some important differences between a situation of andragogy and pedagogy  are presented.

The authors talk about how andragogical assumptions and approaches can be used to teach reading to incoming college students.

Van Allen,  G.  H.  (1982).  Educational  attitudes in  a  state  system of community colleges. Community College Review, 70(2), 44-47.

Using the Educational Orientation  Questionnaire, -  an instrument developed to measure attitudes along an andragogical-pedagogical continuum -  attitudes of community college faculty and students were found to fit well together and to fall near the middle of the scale.
