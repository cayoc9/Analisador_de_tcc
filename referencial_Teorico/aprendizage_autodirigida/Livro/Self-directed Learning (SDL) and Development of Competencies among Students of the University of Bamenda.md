## Abstract

Purpose: This  study  examines  the  relationship  between  self-directed  learning  (SDL)  and development of competencies among students of the University of Bamenda (UBa).

Methodology: The  argument  for  this  study  anchored  on  Vygosky's  Social  Constructivism Theory,  Cognitive  Apprenticeship  Theory  of  Collins  et  al.,  and  Tchombe's  Mediated  Mutual Reciprocity Theory. A correlational survey research design, with a quantitative approach for data collection was used. A sample of 254 students, derived using two probability (stratified random and simple random) sampling techniques and two non-probability (convenience and purposive) sampling techniques, participated in this study. Data obtained were analyzed descriptively and inferentially.  The  Spearman's  Rho  correlation  test  was  used  to  test  the  specific  research hypotheses.

Findings: Findings  showed  that,  there  is  a  significant  and  positive  relationship  between identification of learning problems and development of competencies among students (P&lt;0.000) (R=0.410**). Similarly, findings on hypothesis two showed  that there is a significant relationship between application of appropriate learning strategies and development of competencies among students (P&lt;0.027)(R=0.139*). Lastly, findings on hypothesis three showed that  there  is  a  significant  relationship  between  assessment  and  evaluation  of  learning  and development of competencies among students (P&lt;0.000) (R=0.525**).

Recommendations: Based  on  these  findings,  it  was  recommended  that  there  is  need  for  bias towards action, a competence-based curriculum, and respect of format, frequency and feedback for  assessment  and  evaluation.  Additionally,  Universities  should  adopt  the  SDL  model  as  a learning strategy and develop strategies to overcome obstacles that hinder its application, as well as train teachers on the didactics of the blended learning model.

Keywords: Self-directed learning, problem identification, learning strategies, learning assessment, competencies.

## Introduction

The most foundational definition of self-directed learning (SDL) comes from Malcolm Shepherd Knowles. Malcolm described SDL as a process in which individuals take the initiative, with or without  the  help  of  others,  in  diagnosing  their  learning  needs,  formulating  learning  goals, identifying  human  and  material  resources  for  learning.  Learners  also  choose  and  implement appropriate learning strategies, and evaluating learning outcomes (Brandt, 2021; Saks &amp; Leijen, 2014).  The  high  relevance  of  SDL  in  today's  educational  discourse  suggests  that  the  term  is precisely defined and used in literature. However, authors in the likes of Benson (2011) and (Ng, 2008) point out that the concept of SDL is intangible and ambiguous. Many similar terms like self-regulated learning, autonomous learning, self-planned learning, self-teaching, and independent study are used in the same meaning and context, and the differences between them are  often  subtle  and  inconsistent  which  has  caused  them  being  used  interchangeably  by  many researchers (Saks et al., 2014). This has triggered the present study to investigate the relationship between SDL and development of competencies among students. People can learn lots of things on  their  own  efforts  from  different  sources,  especially  through  the  internet  and  social  media (Blaschke, 2014; Malison &amp; Thammakoranonta, 2018). Such learning channels have an impact on the curriculum decision-making process (Siriwongs, 2015) and the development of competencies among learners.

Competence,  in  its  broadest  meaning,  can  be  defined  as  the  developmental  capacity  to interactively  mobilize  and  ethically  use  information,  data,  knowledge,  skills,  values,  attitudes, and  technology  to  engage  effectively  and  act  across  diverse  21st  century  contexts  to  attain individual,  collective,  and  global  good  (Marope  et  al.,  2017).The  definition  of  competence  by these  authors  recognizes  that  it  is  no  longer  sufficient  to  enable  learners  to  acquire  discrete knowledge, skills, and values. What learners learn is necessary but no longer sufficient. What is most critical is how they can apply what they learned across fast-changing, unpredictable, and even disruptive contexts of the 21 st century.Hence, curricula need to focus on competencies that prepare learners for an unknown future in order to make them futuristic.

The integration of SDL in the teaching-learning process can act as a useful strategy to enhance learners'  competencies  and  motivates  them  to  engage  in  learning  activities  both  inside  and outside the classroom, because they can take the responsibility for what lessons to learn and what problems to solve in real life situations; they are able to choose, plan, manage, and evaluate their learning activities which can be carried out at any place and at any time (Moradi, 2018). Hence, SDL gives learners a greater role in their learning process. However, given the importance of SDL in the development of competencies among University students in Cameroon, there is need for a shift in paradigm from teachability to learnability and from a transmission to transaction view  of  learning  (Tchombe,  2001).  Hence,  this  calls  for  reciprocal  determinism  between  the learner and the teacher whereby the learner is an active participant who initiates and directs his or her own learning process under the guidance of the teacher (Tchombe, 2019).

## Conceptual Review

## Contextual Teaching and Learning

Contextual teaching and learning (CTL) is a student-centered learning strategy that emphasizes students' interests and experiences (Satriani et al., 2012). Berns and Erickson (2001), as cited in Khaefiatunnisa (2015), put forward a definition of CTL from a study conducted by the Office of Vocational  and  Adult  Education  as  a  conception  of  teaching  and  learning  that  helps  teachers relate subject matter content to real world situations; and motivates students to make connections between knowledge and its applications to their lives as family members, citizens, and workers and engage in the hard work that learning requires (p. 83). Educators frequently refer to learning that  is  related  to  a  context  as  'situated  or  anchored  cognition'  (Henning,  2004).  Advocates of CTL  recommend  the  presentation  of  problems  in  situations  that  are  realistic  to  learners  and common to everyday applications of knowledge.

## Principles of Contextual Teaching and Learning

There  are  seven  principles  of  CTL,  which  a  teacher  needs  to  apply  in  a  classroom.  These principles  are:  constructivism,  inquiry,  questioning,  learning  community,  modeling,  reflection, and authentic assessment (Rosa  et al., 2019; Ruhimat,  2012). Constructivism promotes meaningful learning which can help students put the material they have learned in their longterm  memory.  Brown  (2001),  as  cited  in  Khaefiatunnisa  (2015)  observed  that  'meaningful learning  subsumes  new  information  into  existing  structures  and  memory  system,  and  the resulting  association  links  create  stronger  retention'  (p.  56).  Inquiry  encourages  students  to develop knowledge based on their own experience. It also helps them to develop their creativity and critical thinking. Questioning is a teaching skill that greatly enhances the teaching-learning process.  For  instance,  it  arouses  students'  curiosity,  and  helps  the  teacher  gain  students' attention. Learning community encourages students to work cooperatively with others and share their knowledge. In learning community, students can learn how to work in team, how to interact with  others,  and  can  get  information  from  the  community,  inside  and  outside  class,  such  as family or society. Modeling provides a model or an example that can be observed and imitated by every student to help them acquire specific skills or knowledge (Rosa et al., 2019). Reflection guides students to apply their knowledge, attitude, and skill in real-life situations (Sears, 2003). Authentic assessment is conducted during and at the end of the learning process. It shows the teacher how much academic material the students know and what they are able to do (Ruhimat, 2012).

## Blended Learning

Blended learning (BL) refers to the use of a combination of instructional delivery approaches such  as  face-to-face  mode,  online  learning  mode,  and  self-directed  learning  mode  (Kibinkiri, 2019).  Blended  learning  derives  its  meaning  from  the  concept  of  e-learning.  E-learning  is  the systematic  use  of  networked  information  and  communication  technology  in  teaching  and learning  (Naidu,  2003).  Face-to-face  learning  mode  refers  to  a  teaching-learning  process  in which students are in the classroom on seat with the teacher. It is also called on-campus delivery mode. The teacher can bring internet sites of relevance and interest into the classroom. Students

can  also  access  topics  or  course  materials  using  multimedia  technologies,  but  do  not  replace traditional teaching  methodologies  (Kibinkiri, 2019).  On-line  learning  mode  or  delivery, popularly  known  as  E-learning,  is  a  field  of  education  that  focuses  on  teaching  methods  and technology with the aim of delivering teaching, often on an individual basis, to students who are not physically present in a traditional educational setting, such as a classroom (Subrahmanyam &amp; Ravichandran,  2013).  Modern  educational  technologies  and  online  learning  resources  have  a significant potential in supporting autonomous and SDL (Moradi, 2018; Malison et al., 2018). Self-learning  mode  (SLM),  which  is  synonymous  to  SDL,  refers  to  a  process  in  which  the learner,  with  or  without  the  help  of  others,  identifies  learning  needs,  defines  learning  goals, develops and implement a learning plan and evaluates the learning gained (Knowles, 1975, as cited by Guglielmino &amp; Guglielmino, 2003).

## Theoretical Review

## Vygotsky's Social Constructivism Theory (1978)

The proponent of Social Constructivism Theory (SCT) is Lev Vygotsky. Vygotsky argues that learning  and  development  do  not  materialize  in  predetermined  stages,  nor  does  the  individual needs to adapt to and/or approach the process alone. To him, learning is a collaborative activity wherein the environment influences the individual, and learning propels development (Secore, 2017).  Hence,  SCT  emphasizes  the  central  idea  that  learning  and  development  is  a  social, collaborative  activity  (Vygotsky,  1978).  This  is  in  contrast  to  Jean  Piaget  who  focused  on cognitive development as an individual process. The teacher in Vygotsky's theory, serves as a facilitator  and  guide  rather  than  a  director  and  builder  of  learning  (Kibinkiri,  2014).  The relationship between SCT and identification of learning problems is shown on table 1.

Table 1: Relationship between SCT and the identification of learning problems

| Concepts of SCT                    | Identification of Learning Problems                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Social interaction                 | Social interaction enables learners to identify learning problems through  active  involvement,  interdependence,  and  collaboration  with  peers,  which  empowers  them  to  develop  higher-order  cognitive,  self- management, psychosocial, and interpersonal skills.              |
| The more  knowledgeable other      | Parents,  teachers  and  fellow  peers,  and  the  culture  that  surrounds  learners are considered as more knowledgeable others. They assist and  encourage students to master concepts and ideas they cannot understand  on their own, during the identification of learning problems. |
| The zone of  proximal  development | Teachers,  peers  and  members  of  the  learner's  community  provide  guidance and assistance to students as they encounter learning problems.  This enables students to understand concepts that they cannot know on  their own.                                                       |

## Cognitive Apprenticeship Theory (1989)

The term cognitive apprenticeship (CA) was first coined and articulated by Collins et al. (1989). They asserted that, 'We propose an alternative model of instruction that is accessible within the framework  of  the  typical  American  classroom.  It  is  a  model  of  instruction  that  goes  back  to apprenticeship but incorporates elements of schooling. We  call this model "cognitive apprenticeship" (p. 453). Hence, CA is a theory of the process whereby a master with a specific skill teaches that skill to a learner or apprentice, with emphasis on cognitive rather than physical skills (Collins, 1988). The CA learning theory consists of four essential dimensions or features: content, method, sequencing, and sociology (Collins et al., 1991; Brown &amp; Stefaniak, 2016). The four dimensions of CA are diagrammatically presented in figure 1.

Figure 1: Outline of cognitive apprenticeship building blocks and components (Collins et al., 1989, 1991, as cited in Busi et al., 2019, p. 5).

The diagram above presents an outline of  the building  blocks  and  components  of  CA  theory. Content deals with facts, domain knowledge, procedures and general applicable techniques for accomplishing a task and learning strategies. The methods or components consist of modeling, coaching,  scaffolding,  articulation,  reflection,  and  exploration.  Sequencing  deals  with  the  way learning activities are being ordered, and sociology deals here with learning social context where learners  perform  tasks,  which  is  also  known  as  the  authentic  context  for  task  accomplishment (Collins  et  al.,  1989,  1999,  as  cited  in  Busi  et  al.,  2019).  The  relationship  between  cognitive apprenticeship theory and application of appropriate learning strategies is established in table 2.

| Modeling               | This goes with participatory learning whereby, children learned by  observing what their parents, teachers or more knowledgeable were  doing, explaining and demonstrating to them.                                                                                                                                       |
| Coaching               | The  relationship  here  could  be  established  with  mastery  learning  where,  children  learned  through  the  guidance  of  their  parents,  teachers or more knowledgeable during their learning activities.                                                                                                        |
| Scaffolding            | Here,  the  relationship  could  be  established  with  lifelong  learning  perspective  given  that,  assistance  was  given  to  children  or  adult  whenever necessary to help them improve upon their knowledge and  skills by the more knowledgeable.                                                               |
| Situated learning      | Contextual teaching and learning correlates with situated learning in  that, learning is related to the needs, interests and experiences of the  learner and his community.                                                                                                                                               |
| Intrinsic motivation   | The  correlation  here  could  be  established  with  lifelong  and  contextual  teaching  and  learning.  This  is  because,  these  learning  activities  motivate learners to make meaning out of the knowledge  and skills  they  acquired  to  improve  upon  their  own  wellbeing  and  that of their communities. |
| Exploration            | Hands-on-learning activities here gave the opportunity to learners to  explore  their  competencies  by  accomplishing  tasks  and  solving  problems on their own when assigned by the more knowledgeables.                                                                                                              |

## Tchombe's Mediated Mutual Reciprocity Theory (2019)

Mediated  Mutual  Reciprocity  (MMR)  is  a  theoretical  perspective  of  learning  processes  by Therese  Mungah  Shalo  Tchombe.  The  MMR  theory  considers  the  learner  as  an  active transformer  of  ideas  to  create  new  knowledge.  The  transformative  role  of  the  learner  is  very central  to  the  MMR  theory  (Tchombe,  2019).  Unlike  the  social  constructivist  perspective  of Vygotsky (1978) that emphasizes the role of the adult in leading a child through his/her ZPD, Tchombe's MMR sees the child and adult as co-constructors of knowledge where the child has more responsibility in solving any problem. Hence, learning from the perspective of MMR is an unconditional give-and-take process with no hierarchy. One way of introducing learners to selfassessment, according to her, is through SDL activities related to problem-solving, learning, and assessment  strategies  because  MMR  supports  the  view  that  learning  in  the  African  cultural context is through experimentation, participation, observation, modeling, imitation, hand-on, and

collaboration. Table 3 establishes a relationship between the three learning processes of MMR theory and assessment and evaluation of learning.

## Statement of the Problem

Education can foster the manpower requirements of a Nation by helping learners to develop their competencies,  in  terms  of  knowledge,  skills,  and  attitudes,  in  order  for  them  to  become  selfreliant. From observation, the teaching-learning process in The University of Bamenda is highly campus-oriented and lecture-based, characterized by lengthy classes that run up to Saturdays and Sundays, fewer assignments and/or tasks to students, dominant teaching role of lecturers, narrow mode of assessment and evaluation of learning that bases students' success on measured skills only  in  some  particular  intelligences,  and  too  many  courses  with  similar  content  knowledge. Consequently, students have limited time to practice, are unable to apply what they have learnt in order  to  solve  real-life  problems,  have  low  degree  of  control  over  the  learning  process,  are dependent and unable to direct their own learning without teacher support, are less interested, motivated,  and  willing  to  do  relevant  assignments,  have  difficulties  to  effectively  assess  and evaluate  their  own  learning,  have  limited  opportunities  to  experience  the  joy  of  discovery  in learning, and are passive recipients of untested and disconnected ideas that give no direction to learning.  The  heavy  workload  challenge  in  the  number  of  lessons  and  classes  is  contrary  to Whitehead's  (1929)  two  educational  commandments:  'Do  not  teach  too  many  subjects,'  and again,  'What  you  teach,  teach  thoroughly'  (p.1).  In  view  of  all  these,  this  study  set  out  to investigate the relationship between self-directed learning (SDL) and development of competencies in students of The University of Bamenda.

## Main Research Hypothesis

Ho: There is no significant relationship between SDL and development of competencies among students of The University of Bamenda.

## Specific Research Hypotheses

Ho1 : There  is  no  significant  relationship  between  identification  of  learning  problems  and development of competencies among students of The University of Bamenda.

Ho2: There is  no  significant  relationship  between  application  of  appropriate  learning  strategies and development of competencies among students of The University of Bamenda.

H03 :  There  is  no  significant  relationship  between  assessment  and  evaluation  of  learning  and development of competencies among students of The University of Bamenda.

## Research Methodology

This study made use of correlational survey research design with a quantitative approach. The area of the study was the main campus of the University of Bamenda (UBa). The population of the  study  comprised  of  16,543  students  distributed  across  the  12  Schools  of  UBa  for  the 2019/2020 academic year (Admission and Records Division, UBa, 2020). The target population comprised undergraduate and master's students, while the accessible population, from which the sample was drawn, constituted six Departments from six Schools of UBa. A sample sized of 254 respondents was obtained using both probability (simple random and stratified random) and nonprobability  (convenience  and  purposive)  sampling  techniques  where  appropriate.  A  40  items closed-ended  questionnaire  was  used  to  collect  data.  The  instrument  was  validated  through  a pilot  study  involving  15  students  of  Higher  Technical  Teacher  Training  College  (HTTTC) Bambili who were not part of the sample, with an overall reliability index which stood at 0.732. Data was analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. The Spearman Rho test was used to test the specific hypotheses of the study.

Statistically, there was a significant and positive relationship between identification of learning problems and development of competencies in students (P-value=0.000&lt;0.05). The positive sign of  the  correlation  value  (R=0.410**)  implies  that  the  development  of  competencies  was  more likely to increase when students identify their learning problems. Therefore, the null hypothesis which states that, there is no significant relationship between identification of learning problems and development of competencies in students was rejected and the alternative which states that, there is a significant relationship between identification of learning problems and development of competencies in students was retained.

Statistically, there was a significant and positive relationship between application of appropriate learning  strategies  and  development  of  competencies  in  students  (P-value  =  0.027&lt;0.05).  The positive sign of the correlation value (R=0.139*) implies that the development of competencies were  more  likely  to  increase  when  students  apply  appropriate  learning  strategies  in  their environment. The null hypothesis which states that, there is no significant relationship between application of appropriate learning strategies  and development of competencies in student was rejected  and  the  alternative  which  states  that,  there  is  a  significant  and  positive  relationship between  application  of  appropriate  learning  strategies  and  development  of  competencies  in students was retained.

Statistically, there was a significant and positive relationship between assessment/evaluation of learning and development of competencies in students (P-value=0.000&lt;0.05).The positive sign of the correlation value (R=0.525**) implies that the development of competences were more likely to increase when students assess/evaluate their own learning. The null hypothesis which states  that,  there  is  no  significant  relationship  between  assessment/evaluation  of  learning  and development of competencies in students was rejected and the alternative which states that, there is  a  significant  relationship  between  assessment/evaluation  of  learning  and  development  of competencies in students was retrained.

## Discussion

## Identification  of  Learning  Problems  and  Development  of  Competencies  in  Students.

Statistically,  findings  showed  that  there  was  a  significant  and  positive  relationship  between identification of learning problems and development of competencies in students. The positive sign of the correlation value implied that the development of competencies were more likely to increase when students adequately identified their learning problems. This is in congruence with the findings of Vizioli and Kaminsky (2017) who opined that problem identification, problem definition,  problem  solving  strategy,  organizing  information,  resources  allocation,  monitoring problem  solving,  and  evaluating  problem  solving,  improve  students'  creativity  and  ability  on solving problems.

## Application of Appropriate  Learning  Strategies and  Development  of  Competencies in Students.

Statistically, there was a significant and positive relationship between application of appropriate learning  strategies  and  development  of  competencies  in  students.  The  positive  sign  of  the correlation  value  implied  that  the  development  of  competencies  were  more  likely  to  increase when students applied appropriate learning strategies in their environment. This is supported by the  findings  of  Kibinkiri  (2019)  who  stated  that,  the  blended  learning  model  influences  the professional development of University students in Cameroon.

## Assessment and Evaluation of Learning and Development of Competencies in Students.

Statistically,  findings  showed  that  there  was  a  significant  and  positive  relationship  between assessment  and  evaluation  of  learning  and  development  of  competencies  in  students.  The positive sign of the correlation value implied that the development of competences were more likely  to  increase  when  students  assess  and  evaluate  their  own  learning.  This  corroborates  the findings of Tighe-Mooney et al. (2016) who asserted that peer assessment exercise is one of the most successful teaching and learning initiatives in terms of the extent of students' engagement with  the  exercise,  the  positive  feedback  from  the  students,  and  the  level  of  improvement  in  a range of skills that the exercise generated.

## Conclusion and Recommendations

The study concluded that adequate identification of learning problems, application of appropriate learning strategies, and assessment and evaluation of learning by students in their environment have significant positive effects on the development of their competencies. Based on the findings of  this  study  and  given  that  SDL  is  a  new  teaching  and  learning  strategy  in  Cameroon,  the following recommendations are made to universities:

- 1) Universities  should  adopt  the  SDL  model as  a  learning  strategy  and  develop  strategies  to overcome obstacles that hinder its application.
- 2) Teachers should be trained on the didactics of the blended learning model in order to do their job effectively.
- 3) There  is  need  for  bias  towards  action,  a  pedagogic  approach  of  letting  learners  think independently and letting them provide answers to puzzles even if they make mistakes.

- 4) There  is  need  for  a  competence-based  curriculum  that  build  students'  self-confidence towards success in a task, while avoiding a negative self-fulfilling prophecy about learners.
- 5) The  assessment  and  evaluation  of  students'  learning  should  be  carried  out  by  teachers  to consolidate  the  development  of  competencies  among  students  bearing  in  mind  the  format, frequency, and feedback of assessment and evaluation.
