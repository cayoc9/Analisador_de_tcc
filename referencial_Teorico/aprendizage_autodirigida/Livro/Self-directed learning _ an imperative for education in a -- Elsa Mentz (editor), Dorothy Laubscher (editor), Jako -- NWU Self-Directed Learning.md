## Peer review declaration

The publisher (AOSIS) endorses the South African 'National Scholarly Book Publishers Forum Best Practice for Peer Review of Scholarly Books'. The manuscript was subjected to rigorous two-step peer review before publication, with the identities of the reviewers not revealed to the author(s). The reviewers were independent of the publisher and/ or authors in question. The reviewers commented positively on the scholarly merits of the manuscript and recommended that the manuscript be published. Where the reviewers recommended revision and/or improvements to the manuscript, the authors responded adequately to such recommendations.

## Research Justification

This book on self-directed learning (SDL) is devoted to original academic scholarship within the field of education. This is the eighth volume in the North-West University (NWU) SDL book series. In this book, the authors explored how SDL can be considered an imperative for education in a complex modern society. With this book, the authors aim to extend the scholarship of SDL and build upon previous volumes in the NWU SDL series,  now  specifically  focusing  on  SDL  within  diverse  contexts.  In  this  book, academics motivate and provide evidence as to why SDL can prepare students with 21st-century skills  that  are  essential  in  shaping  the  landscape  of  modern  society  in terms of the learning environment and praxis of SDL. The target audience of the book would be scholars and researchers in the field of SDL and higher education.

Although  each  chapter  represents  independent  research  in  the  field  of  SDL,  the chapters  form  a  coherent  contribution  concerning  the  scholarship  of  SDL  and specifically the effect of environmental and praxis contexts on the enhancement of SDL in a complex society. The publication as a whole provides diverse perspectives on the importance of SDL in varied contexts. Scholars working in a wide range of fields are  drawn  together  in  this  scholarly  work  to  present  a  comprehensive  dialogue regarding  SDL  and  how  this  concept  functions  in  a  complex  and  dynamic  higher education context. In the preface, a comprehensive explanation regarding how each chapter  fits  into  the  overarching  themes  of  the  book  is  provided,  and  a  detailed exposition of how each chapter contributes to the relevance of SDL within a complex educational milieu is explained.

This  book  presents  a  combination  of  theory  and  practice,  which  reflects  selected conceptual dimensions of SDL in society as well as research-based findings pertaining to  current  topical  issues  relating  to  implementing  SDL  in  the  modern  world.  The methodologies used in the various chapters include exploratory evaluation, content analysis,  conceptual  analysis,  quantified  self-assessed  competence  ratings,  mixedmethods and qualitative approaches. The varied methodologies provide the reader with different and balanced perspectives as well as varied innovative ideas on how to conduct research in the field of SDL.

A rigorous double-blind peer review process was followed in preparing this publication. In  accordance  with  the  requirements  of  the  Department  of  Higher  Education  and Training, this book contains more than 50% original content not published elsewhere. Furthermore, care was taken to ensure that no part of the book has been plagiarised. We are confident that the 10 chapters in this book will serve as a valuable contribution to the body of scholarship in the field.

While learning on one's own - from toddlers exploring the world around them to older adults adapting to changes characteristic of that life stage has always been with us, serious study of this mode of learning is relatively recent in comparison to other aspects of learning such as memory and cognition. What has  become known as self-directed learning is now a prominent arena for research and theorising. There is, in fact, a voluminous literature base to draw from, an annual international conference on the topic and a website which houses, along with other resources, an online journal devoted to self-directed learning.

One of the major sources for our growing understanding of the nature of self-directed learning as well as strategies for promoting and developing this mode of learning has been the research conducted by the Faculty of Education at  North-West  University  in  Potchefstroom,  South  Africa.  Having  adopted self-directed learning as a major objective in their curriculum and instruction, their research and publications have advanced the world's understanding of how curriculum design and instruction can facilitate the development of selfdirected  learning.  This  book, Self-Directed  Learning:  An  imperative  for education in a complex society, is the sixth in a series reporting on the groundbreaking research and writing on self-directed learning being conducted by this faculty. Their work is even more poignant in today's world of a pandemic wherein learners of all ages have had to move to being more self-directed in their  learning.  Further,  technology  as  a  vehicle  for  learning,  as  well  as  the rapidly  changing  nature  of  technology  requiring  continued  learning  and adaptation, has itself fostered the need for being more self-directed in our learning. As academic institutions struggle to adapt to changing platforms for teaching and learning, the chapters in this book offer both theoretical and practical guidance for developing self-directed learners able to thrive in an ever-more complex world.

Chapter 1 establishes the importance of considering the cultural context of promoting  self-directed  learning  and,  in  particular,  the  African  context  in terms of the philosophy of Ubuntu. What does it mean to be self-directed in a multicultural society where some cultural groups may value interdependence, familial relationships, and learning through story-telling and song and dance

rather than being independently self-directed? Chapter 2 is an exploration of factors of the learning environment that are likely to facilitate self-directed learning,  one  that  fosters  a  sense  of  accomplishment  and  ownership  in learning. Chapter 3 explores the place of self-directed learning in the dramatic shift  to  online  multimodal  learning  as  a  result  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic followed  by  an  overview  of  microworlds  as  supporting  environments  for multimodal self-directed learning (ch. 4). Furthermore, Chapter 5 identifies how  technology  facilitates  metacognitive  regulation  behaviour,  such  as planning, monitoring and evaluation. Chapter 6 centres on the importance of self-assessment throughout the learning process and the role that 'knowledge surveys' can play in promoting self-assessment, an important component of self-directed learning. Chapters 7, 8 and 9 report on research studies exploring the viability of SDL for in-service teacher education (ch. 7), the use of problemcased learning in a chemistry classroom (ch. 8) and developing self-directed learning skills of pre-service mathematics teachers' proficiency in geometry problem-solving (ch. 9). In the final chapter (ch. 10), the focus is on how semiilliterate  street  vendors  acquire  facility  in  mathematics  through  oral,  selfdirected, situation-specific contexts.

The chapters in this book advance both the theory and practice of selfdirected  learning.  Scholars  and  practitioners  alike  will  find  something  to engage their thinking about self-directed learning and, importantly, strategies to  employ  in  fostering  self-direction  in  learners  of  all  ages.  The  ability  of learners to identify their learning needs and the strategies and resources to address those needs is imperative in our rapidly changing, technology-driven, 21st-century world of today.

This publication on self-directed learning (SDL) critically interrogates how this phenomenon is an imperative for education in a complex society. Part of the complexity of education in the modern society is concerned with the diverse contexts  in  which  learning  takes  place.  A  central  theme  on  how  SDL  is approached in this publication is the effect of context and practical steps in the learning process. Consequently, the chapters can be grouped thematically along two lines: the environmental context and praxis of SDL.

Approaching SDL in terms of context is not a new concept, and this use is fairly ubiquitous in the wider SDL discourse. For Knowles (1975), it was an affectual aspect embodied as a 'climate' that determined relationships for learning. In addition, Knowles (1975) even described learning situations as resources  in  themselves.  While  Grow  (1991)  emphasised  the  situational nature of learning, Garrison (1997) included self-management as a process related  to  shaping  the  context,  as  part  of  his  model  of  SDL.  Moreover, Brockett and Hiemstra (2019) emphasised the social context. Self-directed learning  is  inevitably  contextualised  and  localised,  and  this  book  aims  to provide  glimpses  from  10  unique  conceptual  and  empirical  contexts. The learning environment as supporting element to SDL is evident in the first  chapters  presented  in  this  book.  Firstly,  the  need  to  localise  SDL  is evident through embracing the African philosophy of Ubuntu as an essential element  of  the  praxis  of  SDL  (ch.  1).  Chapter  2  specifically  unpacks  the affordances  of  environments  for  SDL.  In  addition,  the  relevance  of  online contexts for SDL was also evident in Chapters 3, 4 and 5 as technology is increasingly becoming an important aspect of the learning setting.

An additional focus of this book is praxis which, in this publication, pertains to SDL in practice. The term praxis, as derived from the Ancient Greek πρᾶξις ,

Olivier (eds.), Self-Directed Learning: An imperative for education in a complex society (NWU Self-Directed Learning Series Volume 6), pp. xxxv-xxxix, AOSIS, Cape Town. https:/ /doi.org/10.4102/aosis.2021.BK279.0p

specifically links up with Aristotle's idea of praxis as doing (Balaban 1986). To this end, in the presented chapters, praxis relates to specific interventions and  realisation  of  SDL  versus  mere theoria (thinking)  or poiesis (making); however,  elements  of  the  latter  could  be  considered  within  the  wider constructivist views underpinning the research presented here.

Within the context of a wider education system where change is needed to address the epistemological and digital challenges students experience, we also  consider  Paulo  Freire's  view  of  praxis.  In  this  regard,  Freire  (2005:51) described praxis as 'reflection and action upon the world in order to transform it'. Hence, through some of the chapters presented here, the way in which a strive towards SDL impacts and even transforms learning is evident. Chapter 6  relates  to  knowledge  surveys  that  can  be  transformative  for  students through  pathways  to  SDL  and,  in  this  case,  specifically  by  means  of  selfassessment. The next chapter (ch. 7) looks at authentic activities for an inservice  professional  development  program  for  teachers.  Chapter  8  also focuses on SDL praxis through a problem-based learning (PBL) intervention. In the following chapter (ch. 9), SDL praxis is considered in terms of problemsolving within the context of mathematics. The book ends with Chapter 10 unpacking the transformative power of SDL in terms of the ethnosemantic structure  of  folk  arithmetic.  For  further  elucidation,  we  present  a  short overview of the chapters included in this book.

The first chapter of this book presents a critical conceptual discussion on how SDL fits in within an African educational paradigm, especially within the context where a lot of the scholarship on SDL is situated within the Global North  and  West.  In  this  chapter,  a  broad  overview  of  what  SDL  entails  is presented in order to set the scene for the rest of the book. Furthermore, this chapter  explores  how  SDL  can  be  culturally  responsive  within  the  higher education environment through considering intersections between SDL and the African philosophy of Ubuntu.

In Chapter 2, a theoretical basis for a learning environment as a variable in the SDL process is unpacked. From the scholarship, it is clear that learning environments  have  an  impact  on  learning  and  by  implication  SDL  as  well. Importantly, a move towards online environments has also had a significant impact on what a learning environment could entail. Importantly, this chapter provides some criteria for environments that could be supportive for SDL in higher education.

The third chapter continues with the theme of an online environment where SDL  is  considered  within  a  multimodal  learning  context.  Specifically,  this chapter  relates  to  online  advice  regarding  the  shift  from  face-to-face  to multimodal  learning.  This  research  involves  an  empirical  investigation  of  a corpus of online advice texts which were evaluated against the literature and set criteria related to self-directed multimodal learning. This analysis shows

that the selected online advice corresponded with existing scholarship and showed some evidence of reification and support of many principles associated with self-directed multimodal learning

Chapter 4 also relates to learning in an online environment as it investigated microworlds as supporting environments for self-directed multimodal learning. In  this  chapter,  with  a  strong  constructionist  theoretical  foundation,  the microworlds  under  analysis  relate  to  Internet-based  educational  resources from different fields. Apart from an inductive qualitative descriptive analysis, features of multimodality are also described. Finally, the chapter also considers requirements of SDL, problem-solving and opportunities for collaboration in terms of the microworlds.

In Chapter 5, the focus is on adaptive prompts to facilitate metacognitive regulation within an online environment. This chapter explores how technology facilitates metacognitive regulation with adaptive prompts by means of an indepth  literature  review.  Furthermore,  a  conceptual  framework  to  support research within this field is proposed based on the deduced evidence for the conditions of prompting. Importantly, this chapter identifies various categories of  metacognitive  prompts for the domains of metacognitive regulation, as well as prompts to aid in the planning, monitoring and evaluation on novice, transition or expert levels.

From Chapter 6 onwards, the focus turns to SDL praxis in subject-specific contexts. Chapter 6 reports on the way knowledge surveys can be supportive to students along pathways to SDL by means of self-assessment. From the data generated from validated and aligned instruments, this chapter confirms that developing students' capacity for self-assessment accuracy is essential to their becoming truly educated. In this regard, knowledge surveys are highly relevant instruments for developing such a capacity. This chapter emphasises the need for teachers to foster self-assessment skills, and it highlights the vital role of self-assessment in decisions that students are confronted with in terms of learning, educational plans and career paths.

Chapter 7 focuses on SDL for in-service teacher education. These authors report on empirical research findings of an in-service professional development program focused on 10 natural sciences teachers. This research determines that  SDL  should  underpin  teacher  professional  development  interventions. Furthermore, the need to engage in-service teachers in authentic laboratory work in order to enhance their understanding of the tenets of science is also highlighted.  The  intervention  does  not  lead  to  transformed  teaching  and learning, and  consequently,  it  is  recommended  that  wider  and  earlier participation in the process and  context could potentially counter a contradiction of control between the intended and realised objects. A revised profile of implementation is proposed as a heuristic for teacher professional development.

Chapter  8  explores  collaboration  as  a  21st-century  skill  in  a  Grade  10 Chemistry classroom in terms of implementing PBL. This research focuses on a  purposively  selected  teacher  and  found  that  with  the  implementation  of PBL, learners rely on each other within groups rather than on the teacher. Furthermore, it was found that PBL implementation promotes SDL because of its collaborative nature. They concluded that there is room to improve the way in which beginner teachers enhance SDL through their teaching. The study also  recommends intervention  programmes to  enable  teachers  to  improve their skills in implementing PBL in physical sciences classrooms to enhance SDL.

Pre-service  mathematics  teachers'  proficiency  in  geometry  problemsolving through the use of multiple-solution tasks in terms of SDL is explored in Chapter 9. In this study, research was done with university students in a module on Euclidean geometry. The findings of this chapter show that the set intervention was successful in increasing the SDL of students with an initially moderate SDL score compared to those with an initially high SDL score. In addition, students with an initially high SDL score were more competent in solving geometry problems compared to students with an initially moderate SDL score. It was concluded that there is a close connection between selfdirected capabilities and problem-solving capabilities.

The final chapter (ch. 10) investigates the role of SDL in the context of the ethnosemantic structure of folk arithmetic of street vendors in Beirut. In this chapter, the aim was to determine whether the acquisition of numeracy using self-directed approaches and engagement in specific numeracy practices in workplace  settings  differentially  modifies  the  type  of  representation  for identified groups of street vendors and illiterate adults living in non-symbolic cultural contexts. It is evident that the ethnosemantic analysis of the researched vending  practices  explains  the  structure  of  logical  relationships  and  the underlying  complex  computations  which  are  inherent  to  a  folk  system  of arithmetic  which  has  been  developed  and  consequently  appropriated  by semi-illiterate street vendors in a self-directed manner.

In  conclusion,  this  book  explores  how  SDL  can  be  considered  as  a  key imperative for education specifically in a very complex dynamic society. To this  end,  the  learning  environments  and  praxis  of  SDL  emerged  as  central overarching themes. As such, the first chapter situated SDL within an African context, while the second unpacked the relevance of the learning environment for  the  SDL process. The next three chapters explored SDL in technologyenhanced  multimodal  contexts specifically in terms of online advice, microworlds and adaptive prompts. The last five chapters involved SDL praxis in terms of knowledge surveys as a form of self-assessment, fostering of SDL for in-service teacher education, collaboration and PBL for school chemistry, problem-solving for pre-service mathematics teachers' proficiency in

geometry as an imperative for SDL and the ethnosemantic structure of folk arithmetic of street vendors. From both the conceptual and empirical works presented in this book, the complex educational milieu is evident. However, within this complexity, it seems to be possible to foster SDL, enable SDL praxis and  through  this  process  regard  its  universality  while  appreciating  its localisable transformative relevance.

## Abstract

Research on self-directed learning (SDL) is crucial in 21st-century educational institutions.  This  necessity  is  a  general  feeling  in  educational  institutions. Self-directed  learning  is  not  all  about  an  exact  educational  technique;  it  is

As South African educational institutions aim to create culturally responsive learning environments, the sociocultural setting should be considered.

## Introduction

Self-directed learning is where the conceptualisation of the learning process is directed by the learner (Brookfield 1984, 1985a, 1995). One of the main focus points in SDL is the increase in independent learning (OECD 2016), which has been used in the United Kingdom and other Western countries to refer to the learning process purposefully positioned in informal educational structures (Brookfield  1985b,  1986).  This  focus  point  has  attachments  to  UNESCO's philosophies  of  'informal'  and  'non-formal  adult  education'  (OECD).  The concept of SDL has been studied comprehensively. However, the increasing research exploring SDL is biased in favour of Western culture (Rensink 2016). Although past research has foregrounded culture as an essential yet influential SDL dimension, it remains less well researched, particularly between ethnic communities (Rensink 2016). The need for in-depth studies on SDL in 21stcentury educational institutions in Africa is crucial. To function efficiently in the 21st century, society necessitates one to own SDL skills as SDL is deemed essential in higher education (Bellanca, Paul &amp; Paul 2014; Cheng et al. 2010). It is  imperative  in  South  African  educational  institutions  which  aim  to  create culturally responsive learning environments. This chapter aims to show how the African philosophy of Ubuntu is beneficial for the promotion of SDL.

## Problem statement

Current changes in education highlight SDL as a crucial prerequisite; it is essential  to  scholars'  learning  attainment  and  their  future  in  the  world  of work as adults (Lopes &amp; Cunha 2017). Internationally, students struggle to keep  up  with  the  upsurge  in  knowledge  and  the  rapid  development  of technology (Duckworth et al. 2019; Du Toit-Brits 2019; Du Toit-Brits &amp; Blignaut 2019).  Difficulty  in  forecasting  the  potential  vicissitudes  caused  by  the increase in knowledge leaves students unprepared to meet future demands (Brockett  1985a,  1985b;  Guglielmino  2013).  Consequently,  education  no longer efficiently supports students in dealing with their future education needs  (Brockett  1983a,  1983b;  Hiemstra  2013;  Hiemstra  &amp;  Brockett  2012). Therefore, SDL needs to be seen to help students face future learning needs,

prepare  them  for  change  (Collins  1991)  and  help  them  increase  their knowledge  (Hammond  &amp;  Collins  1991).  Self-directed  learning  can  help students develop agency and be more self-directed (Hiemstra &amp; Brockett 2011; Pane et al. 2018). South Africa and Africa are rich in diversity, comprising many cultures. If the persons' cognitive development varies across cultures (Santrock 2017; Vygotsky 1962, 1987), the meaning of SDL in different cultures can also differ because of the unique ways applied to understand different phenomena. This further implies that what is regarded as knowledge and truth for an individual is not automatically the case for another individual. To comprehend SDL in the African setting, it is therefore needed to engage with others to grasp what it means to be self-directed in learning, hence our aim towards  showing  how  the  African  philosophy  of  Ubuntu  is  beneficial  for promoting SDL.

## Self-directed learning as context and background

Considering the above introduction and problem statement, an overview of the  historical  foundations  of  different  perspectives  and  SDL  models  is provided in this section. The aim of this chapter is not to deliver in-depth collected work on all the perspectives of SDL. The perspectives presented in this chapter only give readers an introduction to and general background of SDL, with the drive to show how the African philosophy of Ubuntu is beneficial for promoting SDL.

The concept of self-study was a binding fragment and part of the lives of Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Alexander the Great, Caesar and Descartes, to name but a few (McKenzie 1991). Because of societal circumstances and the lack of official  learning  institutes  and  bodies,  numerous  individuals  have  to  learn independently  (Hiemstra  1981,  1982,  1985,  1994,  2013).  In  1975,  Knowles pioneered and established SDL as a student-centred process. He explained SDL as 'a process' of development by which students establish their learning aims, discover essential learning resources, select appropriate techniques and assess  growth  through  reflection  (Brookfield  1995;  Caffarella  &amp;  O'Donnel 1987).  It  is  evident  in  the  body  of  scholarship  of  SDL  that  the  most  used explanation of SDL is that of Knowles (1975), who defined SDL as:

[ A ]  process  in  which  individuals  take  the  initiative,  with  or  without  the  help  of others, in diagnosing their learning needs, formulating learning goals, identifying human and material resources for learning, choosing and implementing appropriate learning strategies, and evaluating learning outcomes. (p. 18)

Knowles' theory of SDL is an expansion of the notion of adult learning that developed from his supposition that, as individuals develop physically and intellectually, they would proceed from the necessity for other individuals to

control them, not wanting to depend on others. He also suggested that adults need to habituate independence - grow the necessity to manage and control themselves - as they have a sense of independence based on their contextual understandings and  experiences. He  further explained adult students' characteristics  and  their  learning  needs,  referring  to  adult  students'  selfdirectedness. Knowles conceptualised SDL from his research on the learning needs  and  processes  of  adult  students.  In  his  research,  he  is  against  a 'mechanistic or transmission-type' of learning; as an alternative, he saw SDL as an enthusiastic and self-motivated approach in which the student takes control of the learning process, with the educator in a supportive role (Knowles 1975).  He  believed  that  students  should  be  lifelong  learners  who  are  selfdirected  individuals,  with  the  educator  who  engages  with  them  instead  of merely transmitting knowledge. To be more self-directed, students should be more goal-oriented and have a sense of ownership of their learning goals, taking  accountability  in  assessing  their  learning  results  (Knowles  1975). Knowles  also  explained  that  SDL  could  be  seen  as  a  teaching-learning approach (Fisher, King &amp; Tague 2001; Long 2000).

According to Guglielmino (1977:57-69), self-directed students are 'open to learning  opportunities'  and  have  a  positive  'self-concept  like  an  effective learner'. While learning, they are allowed to take the initiative, act responsibly and function independently. They also have a 'love of learning', show 'creativity' in their learning and are 'future oriented' with the 'ability to use basic study skills  and  problem-solving skills'. Long (1989:3) (who concurs with Guglielmino) emphasised the 'role of learner characteristics' in SDL. Guglielmino and Long believed that the students' above-mentioned features can promote students' commitment to SDL. Tough (1979) explained  that  SDL  is  a  process  where students plan and take responsibility for their learning. Self-directed learning is also an intentional learning process where students aim to achieve specific information, knowledge and skills (Cross 1981). To achieve specific information, knowledge and skills, students should recognise and accept responsibility for their success and progress in learning (Brockett 1985c; Brockett &amp; Hiemstra 1991). Students' ability to develop learning aims, assess learning outcomes, and select  suitable  learning  strategies  and  essential  resources  is  critical  in becoming self-directed in their learning. In such a learning process, interaction among students and the learning situation is a prerequisite element for the establishment of self-direction (Candy 1991) where students operate independently (Wilcox 1996), and SDL is seen as a model of learning (Blumberg 2000) as well as a form or type of learning (Merriam 2001). That said, it is pivotal that students recognise the applicability of what they learn (Knowles, Holton &amp; Swanson 2005). Learning is based on the internal motivation of a students' desire to know more, and in this process of acquiring information, they solve problems and accept responsibility for learning and performing SDL activities (Manning 2007).

In the literature, SDL is viewed as a process in learning that embraces the recognition of gaps in students' learning, the preparation of how to improve on such learning gaps, and being able to use plans to improve and willing to assess the outcomes of learning (Knowles 1975). The process of SDL is also employed in steps that would enable students to develop into self-directed students.  These  steps  include  the  following:  Identification  of  their  learning needs and goals; selection of their learning resources and the most appropriate strategies to learn, and evaluation of if their identified goals were reached (Knowles 1975:18).

Also, interpreting the thoughts of self-directedness proposed by Caffarella (1993)  and  Merriam  (2001),  SDL  can  be  classified  as  'linear',  'interactive learning style' and 'critical interactive' (Merriam 2001). These classifications have been established to indicate how SDL arises from a holistic viewpoint. Linear views on SDL captured the particular approaches needed to support students,  and  these  approaches  move  in  a  progressive  direction  (Merriam 2001).  The  linear  classifications  were  made  in  the  1960s  and  1970s,  and research done by Houle, Tough and Knowles on SDL falls inside the linear classification. Research on SDL during the 1970s and 1980s was interactive, as students then tried to provide a better understanding of the learning process. Interactive SDL  classifications emphasise  the  student, as well as the environment of learning, and most SDL models and perspectives fall within the interactive classification (cf. Candy 1991; Cavaliere 1992; Garrison &amp; Baynton 1987; Grow 1991; Long 1989; Spear &amp; Mocker 1984; Straka &amp; Schaefer 1997).

Lastly,  the  viewpoints  of  SDL  in  the  critical  interaction  classification  are situated in 'critical theory' of Mezirow (1985) - exploring SDL through political self-consciousness  and  the  capability  of  students  to  make  alterations.  The SDL research of Brookfield, Collins, Hammond and Mezirow is based on the interactive  classification  grounded  in  critical  beliefs.  Next,  we  give  a  brief overview  of  the  Person-Process-Context  (PPC)  model  embedded  in  the 'Personal Responsibility Orientation' model of Brockett and Hiemstra.

## The importance of context in self-directed learning

The  PPC  model  is  highlighted  because  it  focuses  on  the  'psychological', 'pedagogical'  and  'cultural'  dimensions  of  context  and  their  importance  in cultivating  SDL.  This  model  suggests that SDL can be accomplished when (1) individuals (students) are self-directed, (2) the learning process inspires students to be accountable, and (3) the cultural and learning situation provides a favourable setting for SDL (Hiemstra &amp; Brockett 2012).

The PPC model integrates three critical dimensions of SDL: person, process and context (Brockett &amp; Hiemstra 1991; Hiemstra &amp; Brockett 2011). This model illustrates that the person and process can be in place and accommodated

but that the context of learners should also be acknowledged and integrated into teaching and learning for education to translate into meaningful learning experiences. The person is, for example, represented by life satisfaction, how they  think  about  themselves,  their  experiences  in  life  and  creativity.  The process entails  learning  styles  implemented  in  education,  planning  and organisation of teaching and learning moments, and facilitation of teaching and learning (Hiemstra &amp; Brockett 2012). Context represents, among others, the environmental climate comprising the culture of different stakeholders in the teaching and learning situation, the environment created for learning to occur and the climate of the classroom in which teaching and learning take place  (Hiemstra  &amp;  Brockett  2012).  In  this  chapter,  we  focus  on context , described as the 'sum total of all factors that can influence what and how a variety of content areas are taught and learned' (Metzler 2005:54). That said, 'education is more effective when [educators] adapt instructional formats to the context within which they teach' (Siedentop 1991:226). After all, students construct meaning in particular contexts indigenous to them, such as their cultural and social contexts (Duchesne &amp; McMaugh 2016). Hence, context is essential  in  any  learning  environment,  for  example,  to  promote  SDL  as knowledge  and  what  is  seen  as  knowledge  and  how  such  knowledge  is understood differently from one learner to the next and from one context to the next (Duchesne &amp; McMaugh 2016).

These  essential  elements  involve  students  in  their  learning  practice, influenced by their social circumstances (Hiemstra &amp; Brockett 2012). The PPC model further suggests that educators are essential in inspiring and promoting SDL  and  self-directedness  in  students.  Here,  SDL  should  be  considered  a 'process'  facilitated  by  collaboration  between  students  and  their  learning environment. In this 'process', students' cultural background is imperative in their journey towards self-directedness. Many other aspects, that is, social and demographic aspects,  can  affect  students'  self-directedness  (Du  Toit-Brits  2015; Knowles 1975).

Considering the different contexts students come from can give educators insight into the best possible teaching and learning practices. In light of the above information, we argue that educators who consider context may be able to:

- 1. identify the needs of their students to understand them better
- 2.  design, develop and facilitate lesson content so that it reflects the students in the class
- 3.  deconstruct and reconstruct what it means to be successful, for example, allowing students to set appropriate goals reflecting their unique contexts
- 4.  improve  on  their  teaching  methodology,  as  they  can  use  reflective practices  in  adapting  the  way  they  teach  to  be  more  responsive  to different contexts.

The underpinning methodology of teaching and learning and, most importantly, the context in which teaching and learning occur are imperative in this chapter, as they shape the learning experiences of students, which can contribute to the promotion of SDL (De Klerk &amp; Fourie 2017; Hiemstra &amp; Brockett 2012). Thus,  SDL  should  be  regarded  as  a  'process'  facilitated  by  collaboration between students and their learning environment. Therefore, we argue that context is vital in SDL as it can support a 'frame of learning' and a 'melting pot of learning' where context can encourage student engagement and application of new understandings in their learning. Therefore, SDL cannot be separated from  the  context's  students  come  from,  and  SDL  development  does  not happen in a specific contextual 'vacuum'.

## The African context

Africa, the second-largest and most-populous continent globally, is endowed with rich and diverse cultures with an estimate of over 1000 spoken languages (Ouane &amp; Glanz 2010).

Most Africans can be identified through their culture, inherited knowledge,  history,  customs  and  language  as  their  landmark  (Dei  2012; Kanu  2020). Culture is  defined  as  the  totality  of  people's  lifestyle  and tradition,  including  their  way  of  dressing,  talking,  eating  and  learning (Cole  &amp;  Packer  2019).  It  is  the  central  structure  of  learned  behavioural patterns  characteristic  of  society  members  (Cole  &amp;  Packer  2019;  Kanu 2020).  In  addition,  culture  is  considered  an  ancient  landmark,  although landmarks  are  related  to  the  identity  of  place  (Kanu  2020).  There  is  a relationship between culture and the recognition of people (Cole &amp; Packer 2019)  because  culture  can  speak  of  landmarks  and  vice  versa.  Overall, Africans have their way of doing things differently from Europeans or any other continent (Nwigwe 2019).

The African context consists of several norms and values which bond African people (Essien 2018; Sesanti 2016). Furthermore, Africa has different modes  of philosophy,  which  have  been  forever  marked  by  the  colonial experience and can be divided into precolonial and postcolonial expressions (Horsthemke  2017;  Kanwar  2019).  Precolonial  African  philosophy  mainly involved  oral  tradition;  the  written  custom  came  with  and  flourished  in colonialism, for example, missionary education (Horsthemke 2017). Indigenous  philosophy  and  learnt  philosophy  portray  the  former,  while political philosophy and academic philosophy represent the latter. Traditional  philosophy  comprises  folkloric  customs,  myths,  stories  and legends, continuing in the postcolonial period in both verbal and written forms (Horsthemke 2017).

## The African view of the communal self

All  over  the  continent  of  Africa,  the  notion  of  the  self  is  an  'embodied subjectivity'. It indicates the African self as individuality influenced by the body and community. An indispensable feature of the self is that it is seen as the 'body I am'. The self is exposed to communities' influence, and it can be said  that  the  African  self  is  relatively  prejudiced  by  social  construction (Nwoye 2006). The African notion of the self has been described as consisting of  eight  dimensions:  'embodied  self',  'generative  self',  'communal  self', 'narratological  self', 'melioristic self', 'structural self', 'liminal self' and 'transcendental self' (Nwoye 2006:121). However, for this chapter, we only elaborate on the communal self. The communal self relates to the African self's dialogical identity, emphasising communal reliance and interdependence. This description,  as  mentioned,  entails  that  the  communal  self  is  in collaboration with community members (Nwoye 2006). With this collaboration,  attention  is  drawn  to  the  association  and  interdependence present among communal selves in the African context, where community support  strengthens  the  individual  (Markus  &amp;  Kitayama  1991;  Yasmin, Naseem &amp; Masso 2019).

In the African worldview, the world consists of collaborations, interdependence  and  interconnections  (Knoetze  2020;  Markus  &amp;  Kitayama 1991). It is the community that builds and supports the individual self, and the individual is seen as a being in the community. Mbiti (1970) supported this statement, saying that the individual cannot exist without the community in the African context, strengthening the expression 'I am because we are; and since we are, therefore I am' (Mbiti 1970:141).

Therefore,  the  self  in  African  beliefs  is  fundamentally  communal  and collective; the self, or 'I', as part of a larger group of people relying on each other,  is  seen  as  'we-ness'  (Du  Toit  2011),  'therefore  I  am'  (Letseka  2013; Makhudu 1993). In other words, I am and I exist through other human beings, which is the essence of Ubuntu, as discussed below.

## The notion of the African philosophy of Ubuntu

Ubuntu is an African notion focusing on communal and collective philosophy based  on  a  'non-individualistic  character'.  It  can  also  be  seen  as  the foundation of African philosophy (Hlela 2018; Letseka 2000, 2013). In the 1800s, Ubuntu was recorded in South Africa. The term Ubuntu originally comes  from  Nguni  languages  such  as  Zulu  and  Xhosa.  However,  similar terms  are  also  used  in  other  African  languages  like  Kiswahili,  spoken  in Tanzania (' ujamaa ');  focus on freedom, fairness and harmony; and signify the underpinnings of 'indigenous black populations of sub-Saharan Africa' (Waghid 2018).

Reviewing  the  body  of  scholarship  on  Ubuntu,  we  realised  that  to  give meaning  to  Ubuntu  in  English  is  challenging  as  numerous  researchers (Assié-Lumumba  2017;  Broodryk  2006;  Dzobo  1992;  Hlela  2018;  Knoetze 2020; Lefa 2015; Letseka 2013; Letseka &amp; Iyamu 2011; Makhudu 1993; Masondo 2017; Mbiti 1970; Ngozwana 2020; Piper 2016; Tran &amp; Wall 2019; Yasmin et al. 2019; Xulu 2010) have written about Ubuntu as an African philosophy. These researchers have diverse understandings of and explanations for 'humanness' or 'I am because we are' and focus on its communal and collective nature.

'[B]e-ing' an African and the African 'knowledge branch' are embedded in Ubuntu (Hlela 2018; Masondo 2017), and therefore, Ubuntu can be recognised as '…the wellspring flowing with African ontology and epistemology' (Ramose 2002:30). Ubuntu is recognised as the heart of African philosophy. We argue that  Ubuntu,  therefore,  represents,  as  Ramose  (1999:35)  say,  'a  persuasive philosophical argument…[the idea]…that there is a 'family atmosphere' - a kind of philosophical affinity and kinship among and between the indigenous people  of  Africa',  which  can  be  seen  as  a  philosophical  relatedness  and consanguinity among the indigenous people of Africa.

When we give Ubuntu a closer look, 'ubu-' is focused on numerous forms of being and is oriented towards '-ntu' (Hlela 2018; Letseka 2013; Masondo 2017). On an ontological level, there is no separation between 'ubu-' and '-ntu' and  they  are  commonly  grounded  in  'be-ing'  a  'one-ness'  (Dzobo  1992; Gyekye 1997; Oruka 1990). 'Ubu-' as the 'be-ing' is conspicuously ontological, and  '-ntu'  as  the  'be-ing'  who  takes  responsibility  may  be  said  to  be epistemological.

As a human being [ umuntu ], one needs to have attentiveness to endorse collectivity, relatedness and togetherness in the community, which continues to direct the being in acquiring experiences and knowledge (Okyere-Manu &amp; Konyana 2018). This notion resembles a significant action rather than an act because 'be-ing' human is not sufficient in Ubuntu. A person is instructed to come to be a human being, and one needs to demonstrate that one is the image of Ubuntu (Botho). 1   This  notion  is  based  on  the  ontological  understanding of the principle of 'be-ing' and more specifically 'be-ing' as 'one-ness'. Botho is thus seen as the relatedness between individuals to promote agreement, interconnectedness and togetherness between individuals living together in a community. Human beings should have profound compassion, understanding and awareness of another human's feelings and goodness to model being human to other human beings (Mangena 2016), hence 'I am, because we are…' (Mbiti  1970:141)  or-  'Umuntu  ngumuntu  ngabantu'  ('a  person  is  a  person through other people') (Nyaumwe &amp; Mkabela 2007; Shutte 2001; Xulu 2010). Thus,  it  is  essential  to  note  that  'the  individual  is  not  independent  of  the

collective; rather, the relationship between a person and her/his community is reciprocal, interdependent and mutually beneficial' (Oviawe 2016:3). Hence, the starting point of African epistemology is based on 'we are, therefore I am' because African philosophy is a collective awareness that is not just based on what we perceive and reason but also on what we feel and learn. That said, this  communal collective also reflects a rich knowledge base that exists in African communities.

## The rich knowledge base existing in African communities

Concerning  Ubuntu,  as  stated  above,  the  community  is  the  top  priority (Venter 2004). In African communities, individuals are firstborn from their community and into the community, making the individual always part of a larger  collective  of  Africans  (Venter  2004).  African  life  is  grounded  in the various communities to which individuals belong, and individuals become human through other human beings (Venter 2004). From infancy, we are raised in particular settings where we are exposed to knowledge in particular contexts that ultimately shape our thoughts and language (Vygotsky 1978). Therefore,  Africans  can  be  seen  as  a  collection  of  individuals  with  a  rich knowledge  base  shared  from  individual  to  individual  and  community  to community. How we think about knowledge and what we see as knowledge is  indigenous to the communities in which we are raised. Thus, communal education starting early in a child's life resembles the 'we-ness' (Du Toit 2011) of education, as we all learn from and through each other, strengthening the role of Ubuntu and its promotion of SDL.

The notion above relates well to social constructivism as a learning theory based on Vygotsky's belief that learning is underpinned by social processes vital  for  learning  to  occur  (Duchesne  &amp;  McMaugh 2016). In addition, social constructivism advocates that human growth is dependent on the knowledge that is constructed through interaction with others (McKinley 2015). In other words,  people  work  together  to  add  meaning  to  something  they  learn collectively  or  deconstruct  and  reconstruct  knowledge  to  arrive  at  new meanings. As much as constructivism's focus may be on the collective, it is also interested in the learning process happening in a person as they learn and construct knowledge through others. In social constructivism, learning and learning  effectiveness  are  dependent  on  social  interaction  (Duchesne  &amp; McMaugh 2016).

The rich knowledge base that we refer to in this sense is established through  collaboration  among  African  people.  Viewed  from  Ubuntu,  the rich knowledge base that African people have is the basis of their existence that they use to manoeuvre through life and fulfil their communal duty of

'each one teach one'. Living according to this African American proverb means that every literate African person has to help other Africans to a point where they are literate - in other words, each person is a source of information that needs to be transferred to the next person (Each One Teach  One  2020).  Students  from  African  communities  reflect  unique experiences because of the way(s) in which they conceptualise what was taught to them. Such experiences reflect an understanding of phenomena that  belong  to  different  communities  in  Africa  and  further  confirm  that a  rich  knowledge  base  exists  but  can  also  be  taken  advantage  of  in  a student's journey towards SDL.

Social  constructivism,  Ubuntu  and  SDL  are  related  in  that  all  of  these concepts are based on social engagements between people - be it to identify new learning needs; to develop group and individual learning goals; to share knowledge, experiences or resources; to construct new knowledge; to form a collective;  or  to  develop  into  a  self-directed  individual.  These  concepts epitomise the 'we-ness' (Du Toit 2011) that resembles how Ubuntu contributes to  SDL.  To  conclude,  Ubuntu's  notion  signifies  compassion,  fellow  feeling, kindness, consideration, understanding, sympathy, goodness and sharing, to mention but a few distinctive qualities. Ubuntu gives individuals the motivation to develop into a 'be-ing' with the qualities mentioned above underpinned by respect for other individuals. It also allows individuals to accept responsibility and to be genuinely human. It is our understanding that Ubuntu is significant to  all  nations  and  all  domains  of  life.  In  this  chapter,  we  use  Ubuntu  as  a 'conceptual  lens'  to  show  how  this  African  philosophy  is  beneficial  for promoting SDL.

Young African students in the 21st century require skills (including the skill to be self-directed in their learning) that will prepare them and others for global  teamwork,  suggesting  the  need  to  incorporate  SDL  in  the  African context. Louws et al. (2017) corroborated the need for self-directedness and SDL in the changing world associated with the digital revolution (Guglielmino 2013; Verster, Mentz &amp; Du Toit-Brits 2018). In the African context, like on other continents, SDL impacts organisational innovation significantly and, in turn, organisational  innovation  has  direct  and  significant  influences  on  organisational performance (Li-An 2011). Self-directed learning is a suitable and favourable process of fostering lifelong learning and keeping students up to date (Kidane, Roebertsen  &amp;  Van  der  Vleuten  2020;  Mohammadi  et  al.  2020)  (Guglielmino  2013, cited in Du Toit-Brits 2019):

Modern-day  changes  at  economic,  social,  cultural  and  political  levels  and  the education system characterised by transformation and scarce resources, demand SDL, which is vital to students' success in education and the world of work. (p. 1)

It is essential to highlight some of the studies on SDL conducted in Africa.

## Self-directed learning research in Africa

Self-directed  learning  literature  is  widely  available  in  Western  countries; specific research and publications in SDL related to the African context and culture  have  increased  significantly  in  Africa.  However,  most  published research appears to have been carried out in South Africa. Du Toit-Brits (2019) studied the development of students' self-directedness and how educators' expectations influence it. One of the critical conclusions in her study was that direct teaching methods are still prevalent in South African schools and their Higher Education Institutions; hence, students are not adequately prepared for lifelong learning in the 21st century. Du-Toit-Brits (2019) also concluded that educators are fundamental in hindering and fostering SDL for students to become self-directed in their learning. She further asserted that interaction mediates SDL among students and the environment in which learning takes place,  emphasising  the  educator's  centrality  and  their  expectations,  which influence the guidance they give students in becoming  self-directed significantly.  Acquisition  of  SDL  skills  by  students  to  meet  the  changing demands in a dynamic framework of rapid globalisation and massive 21stcentury  transition  were  recommended.  Studies  revealed  that  most  African youth nowadays prefer to engage with, that is, computers and smartphones, which require them to develop their SDL skills so that they can use these technological devices to their advantage in teaching and learning (Amugongo 2018; Schlebusch 2018).

The North-West University's SDL Research Unit outlines a great diversity of SDL expertise, including online resources such as videos produced by the Unit over the years (eds. Mentz &amp; Oosthuizen 2016). This compendium points to the  fact  that  SDL  has  become  increasingly  important,  not  just  for  South African education but also for education sciences globally, which is evident in the  book  of  Mentz  and  Oosthuizen  (2016)  titled  'Self-directed  learning research:  An  imperative  for  transforming  the  educational  landscape'.  The book focused on SDL theory, exploring strategies like cooperative learning, teaching using case studies, teaching large classes and using blended learning to  promote  SDL.  Most  of  these  mentioned  strategies  apply  to  the  African context - for example, in African culture, people believe in supporting each other; therefore, using cooperative learning where 'Ubuntu /Umuntu' culture is encouraged to develop SDL skills might be suited to the African student.

Another study that showed a relationship between culture and SDL was conducted  at  the  Central  University  of  Technology  in  South  Africa  (Swart 2018).  The  study  involved  African  engineering  students  who  enrolled  in  a module for project-based learning to determine the applicability of SDL to first-year African engineering students. Results showed that African engineering  students  understood  the  importance  of  adopting  SDL  and proposing indigenous learning methods. In the African context, people believe

in sharing ideas, and these shared ideas are later applicable in one way or the other when one wants to solve a problem - this is where indigenous learning methods might be of importance. Self-directed learning applies to all regions/ continents and cultures worldwide, including Africa (cf. Joshi &amp; Dixit 2020; Mzuza &amp; Van der Westhuizen 2019). However, a few students indicated that it  was  taxing  to  pursue  SDL  in  different  contexts  that  comprised  diverse cultures - suggesting that the different contexts people come from indeed impact SDL.

One  more  study  on  SDL  was  conducted  at  Malawi  College  (Molande, Mtemang'ombe &amp; Chikasanda 2017). In this study, the researchers explored the effectiveness of PBL and the traditional teaching method on students' performance  in  Woodwork.  The  researchers  found  that  PBL  was  a  more practical approach than traditional teaching methods (Molande et al. 2017). Results showed a substantial difference in student success among the two groups of participants (Molande et al. 2017).

A  study  in  Tanzania  (Charles  2017)  explored  undergraduate  students' information  literacy  skills  and  SDL  capability  at  the  Open  University  of Tanzania. The findings showed no substantial variations in abilities in terms of gender,  age  and  marital  status  in  information  literacy  practices  among students (Charles 2017). The findings also revealed that different factors in information literacy skills could influence students' development of SDL. In light of the findings, Charles (2017) suggested that literacy education should start  from  the  primary  education  level  to  provide  students  with  a  better information literacy skills foundation before they embark on higher education studies.

In their study in Kenya, Opiyo and Oboko (2019) explored the potential of SDL to 'give a second chance and provide learning opportunities to youths and  young  adults'.  Results  showed  teaching  methods  promoting  lifelong learning might help people who want to further their education when they are older, especially those who have left school in their younger years because of various reasons. The researchers, in this case, believed that SDL skills offer learners the flexibility to learn in a way suited to them despite busy plans.

A study conducted in Nigeria sought to determine the SDL readiness of nursing students' and how their readiness influences learning outcome (Ojekou &amp;  Okanlawon 2019).  The  results  showed  a  significant  relationship  between learning outcome and the type of method used (Ojekou &amp; Okanlawon 2019). The  results  also  revealed  that  nursing  students'  SDL  readiness  level  had  a significant effect on learning outcome. The researchers recommended that nursing training institutions provide essential resources to embrace SDL as a central-line teaching technique to certify competent lifelong experts (Ojekou &amp; Okanlawon 2019).

Numerous studies conducted in Africa on SDL have proven that it is also relevant to the African context. One cannot talk about research conducted on SDL without elaborating on the 'communal self' in the African context.

## The connection between the principles of Ubuntu and self-directed learning characteristics

This section deals with the relationship between Ubuntu and SDL. We highlight this connection through a discussion of the principles that underpin Ubuntu and the characteristics of SDL. As mentioned in the previous section, Ubuntu is signified through certain principles. These principles include, among others, care,  community, harmony, hospitality, respect and responsiveness (Bolden 2014; Nzimakwe 2014).

Care, or caring, is a norm and a principle of Ubuntu (Metz 2007). Waghid and Smeyers (2012:13-15) mentioned that the link between ethics of care and Ubuntu relates to an awareness of morality leading African people on to a journey where their dealings with people are underpinned by care, compassion, hospitality and the forgiveness of others for all to function together where they are connected and interdependent. According to Gregory (2000):

[ C ]aring is, first of all, to be aware of the network of human relationships in which one is involved and secondly, to consider the effects of one's actions on the people to whom one is socially related. (p. 252)

That said, three elements of Ubuntu underpin care. These elements include the following: how African people deal with each other should resemble taking each other into account, remember that we are all humans and remember that we should be generous (Mugumbate &amp; Nyanguru 2013; Sekudu 2019).

The role of community in Ubuntu resembles a sense of togetherness among African people. On the one hand, community or functioning as a community resembles harmony and is deemed a blend of identity and solidarity (Metz &amp; Gaie  2010)  among  African  people.  Communal  harmony  in  this  sense  is characterised by the idea that '[e]very member [of the community] is expected to consider him/herself an integral part of the whole and to play an appropriate role towards achieving the good for all' (Gbadegesin 1991:65). On the other hand, in Ubuntu, harmony is established through close social relations in a group that reflect sympathy (Mokgoro 1998). 'The fundamental meaning of community is the sharing of an overall way of life, inspired by the notion of the common  good'  (Gyekye  2004:16),  which  can  eventually  contribute  to harmonious living conditions.

Hospitality in Ubuntu should be seen as African hospitality (cf. Gathogo 2008). African hospitality is described as 'an extension of generosity, giving

freely without strings attached' (Gathogo 2008:42). As Ubuntu resembles a collective  or  one-ness  with  a  group,  it  can  also  be  said  that  within  such  a group, African hospitality is resembled through 'an unconditional readiness to share' (Echema 1995:35). Archbishop Tutu (1989) expressed African hospitality and its interdependent inclination best by saying:

Africans believe in something that is difficult to render in English. We call it Ubuntu, Botho. It means the essence of being human. You know when it is there and when it is absent. It speaks about humaneness, gentleness, and hospitality, putting yourself on  behalf  of  others,  being  vulnerable.  It  embraces  compassion  and  toughness. It  recognizes that my humanity is bound up in yours, for we can only be human together. (p. 69)

Acting towards others with warmth and kindness, for example, is part of being African and expresses the ideal African persons (Gathogo 2008).

Ubuntu and respect go hand in hand. Respect in this regard is twofold because  one  should  first  respect  oneself  before  knowing  how  to  respect others (cf. Poovan, Du Toit &amp; Engelbrecht 2006). In addition, treating others with respect also entails acknowledging that each person is a valuable asset to the African community, resembling their dignity (cf. Bekker 2006). Mbigi and Maree (1995) argued that respect and dignity is part and parcel of Ubuntu, and the trust of fellow Africans is obtained by treating them with respect and granting them dignity. Working optimally and functioning as a larger team where relationships are built necessitate unconditional respect (Poovan et al. 2016). Treating each other with respect and dignity from Ubuntu's perspective is vital to reach goals identified and set by individuals and groups (Poovan et  al.  2016).  Thus,  learning  communities  should  be  based on high levels of respect and dignity to increase trust levels to occur among individuals forming part of a larger group (Poovan et al. 2016).

Responsiveness in Ubuntu is characterised by openness to other perspective or  other  views  that  people  from  various  backgrounds  hold  in  the  African context (cf. Pitsoe &amp; Letseka 2016). In the education context, responsiveness thus  means  that  educators  are  receptive,  open  and  sensitive  to  individual students' needs in a larger group. Educators and students being responsive listeners and responsive speakers in this regard are also valuable (cf. Shotter &amp; Cunliffe 2003). We believe that being responsive speakers' means that we speak based on what we heard or that our reaction is based on what we heard. Also, being responsive entails mindfulness - to be mindful of what is said  and  how  it  is  said,  ensuring  that  it  contributes  to  the  collective  and collective meaning-making. Moreover, responsiveness epitomises the centrality of communication in Ubuntu and African communities, as communal sharing of knowledge  occurs through communication  (through every individual's voice in the larger group) (cf. Deetz 2003).

It is crucial to also elaborate on the characteristics of SDL to illustrate the connection between Ubuntu and SDL, as mentioned earlier. Highlighting the characteristics of SDL necessitates that one should always be mindful that the SDL journey of a student goes along 'with or without the help of others' (Knowles  1975:18).  Thus,  we  can  say  that,  in  the  African  context,  SDL  is mainly  promoted  through  the  help  of  others  (thus  Ubuntu),  be  it  the educator or other students. The journey is a joint activity and individuals form  part  of  a  larger  group  of  people  on  whom  they  can  rely,  and  they understand and construct information in collaboration with others. A selfdirected learner is someone with the following characteristics (cf. Abdullah 2001;  Ertmer  &amp;  Newby  1996;  Guglielmino  2013;  Lounsbury  et  al.  2009; Samson 2013; Tredoux 2012):

- · Creativity.
- · Being goal-oriented.
- · A love of learning.
- · Being organised.
- · Having self-confidence.
- · Having good communication skills.
- · Being optimistic.
- · The ability to reflect on own learning.
- · An abundance of self-motivation.
- · A high level of inquisitiveness.
- · Being flexible.
- · The ability to accept responsibility for own learning.
- · The ability to manage time effectively.
- · The ability to question rules, procedures and assumptions about learning.
- · A strong work ethic.
- · Developing beliefs and opinions independently.
- · Being self-disciplined.
- · Seeing problems as challenges and not as hindrances.
- · The ability to see feedback as constructive feedback.
- · The ability to learn independently.
- · The ability to evaluate own limitations and weaknesses.
- · To be informed about one's strengths, abilities and aspects that contribute to motivation.

We believe that it is necessary to shed light on the characteristics of SDL that resonate with the principles and social inclination of Ubuntu. Reflecting on Knowles' (1975) definition of SDL - a person's journey towards SDL happens independently or through the help of others (be it individuals or a group of people). Self-directed learning also entails identifying learning needs, formulating learning goals, recognising learning resources that can be applied

in learning, choosing and applying suitable learning approaches, and assessing learning  results.  To  show  how  Ubuntu  promotes  SDL,  we  illustrate  the connection between Ubuntu principles and SDL characteristics.

Creativity as an SDL characteristic is not acquired or learnt in isolation. Creativity  is  one  of  the  characteristics  a  person  should  have  in  the  21st century (Dede 2010; Voogt &amp; Roblin 2012). In 'Human Motivation', a book by Franken (2002:396), creativity is  defined  'as  the  tendency  to  generate  or recognize ideas, alternatives, or possibilities that may be useful in solving problems,  communicating  with  others,  and  entertaining  ourselves  and others'.  It  can  be  deduced  that  creativity  is  underpinned  by  motivation promoted through people's desire to solve problems, their desire to share what they think and value, and their desire to be encouraged through diverse, new and complex learning (Franken 2002). Creativity is further dependent on the ability to view phenomena in ways not viewed before or change one's perspective  on  the  different  phenomena  exposed  to  during  the  learning situation (Franken 2002). In addition, the process of being creative is related to the context of people and how a solution to a problem is newly developed on an individual basis or in a collective to be used among a group of people (McGuinness &amp; O'Hare 2012). Ubuntu, therefore, expresses collective creative ideas  and  thoughts  where  the  cohesion  of  collaborations  and  communal ownership go hand in hand. What is more, the use of Ubuntu embraces and stimulates creativity.

Love of learning as an SDL characteristic can be cultivated through parents and educators (cf. Renninger, Sansone &amp; Smith 2004). As lecturers who train students to become educators, we believe that a love of learning starts in early childhood. How students are stimulated goes a long way, and whomever the  educator  is  at  a  particular  moment  (be  it  an  educator,  or  a  peer,  or  a group) depends on someone developing a love of learning (Renninger et al. 2004). Having a love of learning may further influence the lifelong learning of a person (Aguilar 2016). Students are encouraged to ask questions to continue discovering and generating answers to such questions, and people are also offered choices regarding what they want to talk about and what resources they  want  to  draw  on  for  understanding  or  constructing  new  knowledge (cf. Penman &amp; Ellis 2009). Child rearing in Africa, as traditionally defined, is the 'village', highlighting that the entire community is involved in educating a child. Through the upbringing and educating of a child, learners are prepared to take ownership and a love of learning.

O'Shea  (2003)  believed  that  SDL  can,  among  others,  build  the  selfconfidence  of  people.  Self-directed  students  are,  among  other  things, self-confident  (Abdullah  2001).  Du  Toit-Brits  (2019)  believed  that,  during students'  journey  towards  SDL,  educators  should  guide  them  to  become

confident to solve the problems they face or are given to solve and take responsibility for their learning. That said, if educators model confidence to their students during the learning process, they could become ready 'to be self-directed  in  their  learning'  (Du  Toit-Brits  2019:7).  Considering  that  the learning community in a class engages socially with each other, one can say that the educator modelling confidence to students is done socially in the classroom. Therefore, building or cultivating self-confidence in students has a  social  nature.  Self-confidence  is  an  essential  part  of  Ubuntu  because individuals within the communal need to know their value, and they need to have  focus  and  courage  when  working  together  in  the  interest  of  the communal.

Good  verbal  and  nonverbal  communication  skills  are  social  abilities  we deem relevant and necessary to discuss. Inner speech starts to develop in early  childhood  (Blignaut  &amp;  Du  Toit-Brits  2021;  Geva  &amp;  Fernyhough  2019), which implies that one's inner thinking starts at home or as soon as one first makes contact with one's parents or siblings. Nonverbal communication (also referred to as body language) entails how one communicates with one's eyes, face  and  hands;  how  one  moves  around;  and  how  one  appears  to  others (Jacobs  2016).  Both  types  of  communication,  in  our  opinion,  start  with observation  through  which  we  learn.  Also,  we  never  stop  learning  to communicate.  We  believe  that  most  of  our  communication  development happens in our social interactions with each other, and in this case, in the classroom. Through communication, spaces are being created for individuals within the collective to share their deeper  meanings  of  phenomena. Communication is, therefore, crucial in Ubuntu as communication creates a sense  of  the  communal,  and  the  social  influence  of  communication  is accentuated.

Being optimistic about the future or having an optimistic orientation to the future is one of the characteristics that need to be in place for SDL to occur (cf. Guglielmino 1977, 2013). Pessimism and optimism are often observed from the  people  in  one's  specific  cultural  community,  especially  mothers,  who project their negativity onto children (Seligman 2006), leading to pessimism, struggling to see life in a positive light. However, as optimism is observed, it is possible  to  unlearn  pessimism  (Seligman  2006)  by  being  around  positive people and working with others. Thus, the context from which the student comes is essential to cultivate optimism in students. Being optimistic in all situations and conditions is a distinctive aspect of Ubuntu because it conveys optimism as it is a way of life.

A  high  amount  of  curiosity  is  a  characteristic  of  a  self-directed  learner (Guglielmino 1977). In other words, an inquisitive person may be ideal for the promotion  of  SDL.  Through  social  engagements  such  as  educational  opportunities - for example, where an educator or peers ask valuable questions - inquisitiveness

is encouraged and promoted (Price-Mitchell 2015). Educators can be assisted to ask good questions that can trigger curiosity in students about a particular topic.  Opportunities  offered  in  classrooms  where  diverse  students  from different contexts with different curiosity levels can work together on projects could lead to moments where they inspire each other to be curious about a particular  topic  (Price-Mitchell  2015).  The  social  element  in  developing, promoting  and  nurturing  inquisitiveness  in  students  is  therefore  evident. Through  this,  we  also  see  collective  effort  and  dependency  on  others  to develop the ability to be curious - an aspect we believe is central to creating educational opportunities resembling 'we-ness' leading to education for us through us.

Flexibility  is  one  of  the  characteristics  that  enable  students  to  be  selfdirected in their learning (cf. Hinchliff 2004; Holtzclaw 1985; Robotham 1995). We believe that flexibility is acquired over time, especially when working with others. When working with others, one needs to be adaptable, and one fulfils many  roles  that  occasionally  require  one  to  stand  back  and  refrain  from taking the lead. Flexibility is also needed to adapt to unfamiliar environments or situations (Lewis &amp; Williams 1994), such as working closely with people from different contextual backgrounds. Additionally, being flexible requires creative  thinking,  accepting  uncertainties,  applying  emotional  intelligence and changing the focus when working with others (Bailey 2014). Through flexibility  and  thus  the  willingness  to  learn  from  others,  an  atmosphere  of communal respect  is  established  between  community  members  that  also permits for individual development, a sense of communal accomplishment and collective goals.

Considering the information above, it is vital to illustrate how Ubuntu (its principles)  and  SDL  (through  its  characteristics)  are  connected.  Besides context that plays an enormous role in Ubuntu and SDL, it can be deduced that social interaction strengthens the individual both directly and indirectly. That said, the (social) interdependence that underpins Ubuntu and SDL seems to be the obvious connection. Social constructivism, as mentioned earlier, is essential for this chapter as it focuses on social learning and the construction of knowledge with and through others, strengthening the notion that those involved in the teaching-learning process are socially interdependent. Social interdependence is defined as a '[p]rocess of social interaction where certain common goals are established with other people in such a way that each person's results are affected by the actions of the others' (Serrano 2010:429). The social aspect rooted in Ubuntu and SDL is what constitutes the connection between these concepts. Nevertheless, Ubuntu and SDL's social inclination highlight the 'we-ness' that emerges from the connection. It also indicates a collaborative  teaching-learning  process  that  relies  on  social  interaction, cooperation and forming a group of dependent and responsible people to promote the SDL of individual learners in the group.

Forming  a  collective  of  people  in  which  a  rich  knowledge  base  exists reflects more than one person forming a group and is instead highlighted best through  the  pronoun  'we'.  Thus,  the  learning  community  that  Ubuntu establishes that contributes to SDL can be envisioned as 'we-ness: a-perfectfit  SDL community for us'. Such an education community includes commonality and sociability. Here, the student requires dialogue in a community by sharing ideas through social interaction, social dedication, and the lecturer and peers' time-spatial presence in scheduled contact opportunities. Communal cohesion and joint coalition in a community are thus promoted.

Lastly, one might argue that there is a philosophical disjuncture between Ubuntu  and  SDL  if  SDL  is  conceptualised  in  its  narrow  sense  without considering  its  elaborated  definition.  The  'self'  in  SDL  might  lead  to  the assumption that SDL has an individualistic inclination and that the focus of SDL is solely on the end goal: to deliver or get a learner that can function autonomously. This conceptualisation is absent of the process and journey an individual embarks on, which is not done in isolation or by oneself and through oneself. Additionally, conceptualising SDL in such a way only reflects that SDL is achieved 'without the help of others', which is only one side of the same coin.  As  per  Knowles  (1975)  definition  of  SDL,  the  other  side  of  the  coin unequivocally states that SDL  is achieved 'with the help of others'. Understanding SDL within the African context through Ubuntu is central to the principles of Ubuntu. The process or the journey to becoming self-directed through  others  as  in  'I  am  through  others'  is  epitomised  by  a  reciprocal relationship of giving and taking from each other, thereby highlighting Ubuntu principles in SDL within Africa. In this sense, the process becomes the centre of  attention  as  that  is  where  an  individual  is  strengthened  (cf.  Markus  &amp; Kitayam 1991; Yasmin et al. 2019), shaped, supported, empowered and enabled to function as an individual within a larger group. During this process, care is mutually applied in interactions that include learning opportunities where a sense  of  social  cohesion  and  one-ness  with  others  of  the  SDL  community comes to the fore. It is also here where the community is established and nurtured by working together in harmony, sharing each other's spaces and knowledge while respecting each other and being responsive to and attending to  each  other's  needs.  As  a  result,  students  need  to  undertake  joint  responsibility for the learning process where 'You do it together'.

## Wrapping up: The importance of Ubuntu for the promotion of self-directed learning

The  central  belief  of  African  indigenous  education  (Magagula  &amp;  Mazibuko 2004;  Mautle  2001)  is  to  learn  successfully  means  to  live  helpfully  and contentedly  with  family,  community  and  spirits  of  descendants,  hence  the

significance  of  'Botho'  (Sotho  languages)  or  'Ubuntu'  (Nguni  languages) (Hlela 2018). In African indigenous  education,  collective learning, oral education  and  learning  through  dreams,  visions  and  stories  are  essential (Waghid 2014). However, the reality is that education has ignored some of these central essential beliefs of African education (Hlela 2018).

In the African context, a vision for education is to support individuals to attain critical communal principles like Botho or humanism (Broodryk 2006). By attaining Botho through education, the individual grows into an endowed collective  member  who  is  compassionate,  considerate  and  understanding, who  shows  feelings,  goodness,  kindness  and  sympathy  towards  others, endorsing collaboration among be-ings (Broodryk 2006). These principles of Ubuntu  have  been  relegated  to  education  because  of  colonialism  and  a capitalistic economy, of which the consequence was education without the capability to answer to the necessities and well-being of African indigenous communities (Letseka 2000, 2013, 2014).

So, we can ask ourselves: Why is Ubuntu important for education and thus promoting SDL? To embrace Ubuntu in education, Stanistreet (2019:219) is of the view that, 'with its humanistic ethos and emphasis on interconnectedness', teaching and learning should embrace pedagogics that promotes and support the  needs  of  students,  fostering  'a  sense  of  interconnectedness'  between 'learning and social community'. Consequently, education ought to embrace Ubuntu-motivated  teaching  and  learning  methods  (Hlela  2018)  that  focus more on indigenous systems of thought like Ubuntu (Letseka 2014; Letseka &amp; Ivamu  2011;  Parker  &amp;  Roessger  2020)  in  order  to  promote  meaningful educational practices which 'foster an ethos of a holistic, transformative and emancipatory educational experience for all' (Oviawe 2016:2). By implementing the  principles  of  Ubuntu  in  education  (Ubuntu  pedagogy),  an  educational approach can be cultivated that focuses on guiding students on how to learn and assisting them to learn to work in more self-directed ways (Abdi 2020; Assié-Lumumba 2017; Bell 2002), thus focusing on promoting self-direction in learning (Bache &amp; Hayton 2012; Parker &amp; Roessger 2020). Ubuntu can empower and support students to gain control and better understand knowledge as they come to know subjects in the SDL process. This notion accentuates that students need to be actively involved in learning and that knowledge and understanding  should  be  developed  by  communal  groups  focusing  on personal knowledge based on students' lived experiences. Therefore, students must be seen as fellows of a collective in SDL, which may empower them to support  and  care  for  each  other  to  attain  learning.  By  working  together (e.g. solving problems in contributing to their learning goals) can encourage togetherness  and  social  cohesion  and,  as  such,  create  a  constructive  and encouraging cooperative learning atmosphere where knowledge, skills and lived experiences are shared that contribute to the successful implementation

of SDL (Miles &amp; Ahuja 2007). Quan-Baffour (2014:424) is of the argument that 'in  its  essence cooperative learning shares the philosophy of Ubuntu which teaches that  it  is  only  through  cooperation  with  others  that  the  individual realises his or her potential'. It is, therefore, our opinion that the learning  achievement  of  students  working  as  a  collective  in  SDL  requires the learning achievement of the individual. As a result, individual students' learning achievement is the 'responsibility of the group', given that students also take accountability for their learning.

With the implementation of Ubuntu principles which leads to the promotion of SDL in education, educators can cultivate learning environments (Ukpokodu 2016:155) where students are allowed to function in democratic, autonomous learning  environments;  with  the  'freedom  to  co-learn  in  an  environment grounded in humanism', they can think critically and implement self-reflection (Letseka  2013).  Thus,  for  the  promotion  of  SDL  through  Ubuntu,  students should be encouraged to work collectively in partaking and interacting with other students in learning environments, embracing learning environments' communal  and  collective  nature.  Embracing  communal  relationships  with other  students  in  this  communal  and  collective  learning  environment  is essential so that 'learning communities can fully embrace and value humanism, thus Ubuntu' (Broodryk 2006:32; Parker &amp; Roessger 2020). As seen earlier in this chapter, Ubuntu's beliefs and principles in education ought to deliver a compassionate  and  helpful  foundation  where  both  educator  and  student should participate as a collective, accentuating the interdependent nature of the SDL process (Broodryk 2006). Interconnectedness and interdependence, as  Ubuntu principles, are also grounded in SDL and provide students with learning opportunities directed by a greater longing to learn and understand the importance of self-reflectivity. Ubuntu should be regarded as a relevant philosophy and viewpoint that can serve as a compass in SDL to cultivate accountability under students and enhance their attentiveness to others by supporting them in this SDL journey as a one-ness/we-ness, which is beneficial for the promotion of SDL.

We further argue that there need to be purposeful collective relationships between  students  within  SDL  with  the  goal  of  a  determined  and  focused enclosure  of  the  principles  of  Ubuntu  that  can  improve  SDL.  Functioning within  a  collective  learning  community  can  be  responsible  for  improved support and motivation for students. Also, as collective members, self-directed students can benefit from various viewpoints and feedback that initiates from the  collaborative  learning  environment.  We  argue  further  that  SDL  and collaboration need not be seen as isolated constituents, but SDL needs to be seen as an exploratory learning model in that it combines both constituents of

autonomy (SDL) and collaboration, embracing the philosophy of Ubuntu in the  heart  of  SDL.  Finally,  as  a  result,  students  need  to  work  together  to motivate  and  critique,  share  various  perspectives,  and  reflect  on  learning materials and the learning process, emphasising collaborative SDL based on Ubuntu.

Based on the information above, it can be deduced that the limitation of this chapter is that scant attention, if any, has been paid to SDL within the African context. That said, the scarcity of academic sources on this aspect has strengthened the need for this chapter. Because of the mentioned limitation, it was essential to highlight the meaning and place of SDL within the African context through Ubuntu, the African philosophy. Strengthening the need for this  chapter  further  comprises  the  understanding  of  SDL  by,  for  example, scholars who view SDL in a narrow sense or from a Western perspective, that is,  that  SDL  only  leads  to  the  individual  being  able  to  work  independently. Considering this notion, SDL is promoted with or without others' help, implying that the process is not an isolated one but a collective process whether the focus  is  on  the  means  to  the  end  or  the  end  itself,  which  is  collective, collaborative  and  social  underpinned  by  Ubuntu.  Lastly,  in  general,  the chapter's information and arguments pave the way for further research that deals with this critical  aspect and that research on SDL within the African context is crucial.

## Conclusion

Having reached the end of the chapter, we highlighted the problem under study, followed by explaining how SDL serves as context and background in this chapter. We elaborated on the African culture, the communal self as an African notion and Ubuntu as African philosophy, followed by a discussion of the  rich  knowledge  base  existing  in  Africa  and  its  inhabitants.  Also,  we discussed research undertaken in Africa and the African context focusing on SDL.  Furthermore,  we  established  a  connection  between  the  principles  of Ubuntu  and  SDL  characteristics  and  justified  what  constitutes  such  a connection.  We  ended  this  chapter  by  elaborating  on  the  importance  of Ubuntu for the promotion of SDL.

Taking  the  above  information  into  consideration,  it  is  evident  that  the African philosophy of Ubuntu can be beneficial for promoting SDL, not only for Africa but also globally. Ubuntu pedagogy can promote SDL by supporting educators  to  foster  'habits  of  mind'  to  learn  and  work  cooperatively  with diverse others. In this chapter, we underscored that the African philosophy of Ubuntu  is  beneficial  for  promoting  SDL,  as  students  come  from  diverse

backgrounds with the riches of life experiences and a rich knowledge base that  can  promote SDL. Self-directed learning needs to be seen as a social (communal)  action,  focusing  on  achieving  collectively  developed  learning goals through support and cooperation.

## Abstract

There  are  multiple  types  of  learning  environments  across  the  educational landscape.  However,  all  students  need  to  acquire  essential  skills  to  be successful  and  should  feel  encouraged  about  their  learning  experiences regardless of their learning environment. The 21st-century student is in search of  a  learning  environment  that  is  explicitly  planned  to  support  attentive thinking. They desire learning environments that (1) drive their learning abilities through changing their teaching and learning strategies, (2) give a sense of accomplishment  and  ownership,  and  (3)  encourage  them  to  be  vigorous, engaged  participants  during  the  learning  expedition.  The  purpose  of  this chapter is twofold: first, a literature review is provided on how the learning environment can promote self-directed learning,  and  second,  prerequisites

## Introduction

A learning environment is a miscellaneous podium where operators participate and interrelate to acquire new skills (Guglielmino 2013). Such an environment can be a physical location or culture. A learning environment should enhance students'  capability  to  learn,  implying  that  education  should  focus  on resourcefulness and engaging with learning materials rather than memorising facts (Ozerem &amp; Akkoyunlu 2015). Cultivating an engaging and encouraging learning  environment  for  students  needs  to  be  seen  as  a  unique  teaching feature  (Brandt  2020).  Typically,  the  emphasis  is  on  the  classroom  (e.g.  a physical space like a lecture hall or laboratory) or diverse technologies that can be implemented  to  cultivate a learning environment. A  learning environment should be seen in a wider context and include elements (Du ToitBrits 2015; Hiemstra 2013; Hiemstra &amp; Brockett 2012; Knowles 1968a, 1968b, 1970, 1975, 1990, 1991, 1993, 1995, 1996; Ozerem &amp; Akkoyunlu 2015) such as:

- 1. the capability to address students' needs (student individuality)
- 2.  focusing on teaching and learning goals
- 3.  the implementation of interactive learning activities and active instructional procedures  and  learning  resources  that  support  active  and  engaged learning
- 4.  collaboration, engagement and connectedness
- 5.  capability to create a feeling of security
- 6.  fostering a sense of belonging
- 7. educators' skills and roles
- 8.  support
- 9.  supporting and embracing a SDL culture and learning climate.

The elements mentioned above can influence students' learning capabilities and success. These elements can bring about a culture and climate conducive to learning in which students can flourish. An effective learning environment can create a positive atmosphere that is conducive to motivation, commitment and SDL. Such an environment encourages interactive instructional procedures and gives a feeling of support. Below is a brief discussion of what the learning environment should comprise for promoting SDL.

## Problem statement

For  students  to  stay  interested  and  thrive  in  learning,  they  need  to  have confidence that they can learn and that what they learn is valuable, significant and meaningful (Hairon &amp; Chai 2017). Students should also have a sense of belonging in the learning environment, and they must take responsibility for

their  learning  (Boyer  &amp;  Usinger  2015;  Dabbagh  &amp;  Kitsantas  2012).  This encourages self-directed learners who are confident of making the learning content their own and who take ownership of their learning (Guglielmino 2013; Sze-yeng &amp; Hussain 2010).

Self-directed learning is deemed a vital 21st-century skill (Brandt 2020). Learning  environments  should  nurture  and  promote  inquiry  skills  so  that students can continually take responsibility for their learning to acquire new knowledge throughout their lifespan (Gresham 2018; Hiemstra 2013). There is no value in planning and offering education based on regurgitating what is already known; students must be allowed to discover new knowledge and be exposed to teaching practices that promote SDL and enable students to be active and engaged in the learning process (Du Toit-Brits 2020; ISSDL 2020). Self-directed  learning  should  be  recognised  as  a  dynamic,  lifelong  student capability in education. Having provided a brief discussion of this chapter's problem, it is essential to highlight the theoretical and conceptual frameworks foregrounding this chapter.

## Theoretical and conceptual framework

The term learning environment has numerous meanings. A learning environment can be defined as (Wilson 1996):

[ A ] place where learners may work together and support each other as they use a variety of tools and information resources in their guided pursuit of learning goals and problem-solving activities'. (p. 5)

Diverse settings outside of the school context can also be considered learning environments. Therefore, a learning environment is not limited to a 'traditional' environment  like  a  classroom  with  desks  and  a  blackboard.  Moreover,  a learning environment can refer to the principles and values of a specific school or  classroom and characteristics such as how individuals interact with one another (Cohen 1994).

There are different learning environments, such as (but not limited to) faceto-face, online, hybrid and blended environments; thus, a learning environment can  be  traditional,  virtual  or  a  combination  of  these  mentioned  learning environments (Cho, Kim &amp; Choi 2017). Although this chapter's focus is not to provide an in-depth discussion of these learning environments, it is necessary to highlight some of their identifiable features. The first learning environment is a face-to-face learning environment - also known as a traditional learning environment  -  where  learning  happens  in  person  and  students  can  ask questions  and  receive  an  instantaneous  response.  The  second  learning environment is an online learning environment and involves using the Internet; in  this  case,  educators  give  teaching  and  learning  tasks  in  advance,  and students can finish them autonomously in their own time. The third type is a hybrid  teaching  and  learning  environment  that  allow  students  to  attend

classes physically or virtually. The last type is a blended learning environment, and  it  incorporates  synchronous  and  asynchronous  learning  approaches (Porter  et  al.  2016;  Tomberg  et  al.  2013).  However,  variability  in  learning environments  is  vital  as  one  learning  environment  cannot  be  superior  to another learning environment.

Effective learning environments share the following characteristics (to name but a few) (Prameswari &amp; Budiyanto 2017):

- 1. Students feel physically and emotionally safe and can be themselves.
- 2. Students are appreciated, regardless of their abilities, among others.
- 3. Students can take ownership.
- 4. Students are supported.
- 5. Performance  standards  are  recognised  and  rightfully  applied  for  every student.
- 6. Students are offered learning opportunities.
- 7. Students are known to educators.
- 8. The attainment of educational quality is essential.
- 9. Knowledge creates meaningful learning experiences.
- 10.  There is interaction between educators, students and the learning content.

It is also important to note that not all learning environments share the abovelisted characteristics. These are characteristics of effective learning environments. Unequivocally, the above characteristics of effective learning environments grounded in approaches that support students in their learning offer  students  a  place  and  space  with  appropriate  learning  content  and opportunities to create social abilities to formulate clear learning goals and receive  continuous  feedback  (Vanslambrouck et al.  2018).  To  help  learners improve their knowledge and skills, specifically SDL skills, it is of paramount importance that appropriate teaching strategies and activities be implemented. Also, according to Klem and Connell (2004), the learning environment must include the following:

[ O ]ne element which is the school climate which at its most positive, include attention to safety issues, family and community involvement, positive relationships among students and teachers, a strong emphasis on academic achievement, respect for all member of the school community, fair and consistent discipline policies. (p. 112)

This chapter suggests that effective learning environments promote 'active engagement' of students (Prameswari &amp; Budiyanto 2017; Vanslambrouck et al. 2018). For active engagement, students need learning environments that are not as outdated as traditional learning environments but effective learning environments that encourage (Fahnoe 2013; Guglielmino 2013; Hannafin et al. 2014; Moore, Dickson-Deane &amp; Galyen 2011):

- 1. attentive thinking
- 2.  personal connection
- 3.  student agency
- 4.  authentic learning
- 5.  active learning
- 6.  collaboration and reflection
- 7. learning experiences that develop inquisitiveness and passion for learning
- 8.  students who see problems as opportunities in learning, to mention but a few.

Moreover, the learning environment should promote student agency: students should be aware of their role as active learning participants. This notion implies SDL - students should be actively involved in planning, assessing and controlling learning.  Students'  learning  environment  affects  how  they  learn,  their  commitment to and interaction with the learning content, their enthusiasm to learn and their well-being and sense of belonging (Dabbagh &amp; Kitsantas 2012; Wanda 2014). The  implication  is  that  a  learning  environment  may  hinder  or  promote  SDL. Having  discussed  the  different  learning  environments,  the  discussion  below focuses on the importance to adopt SDL in learning environments.

## Self-directed learning

As was stated in Chapter 1, the most agreed-upon definition of SDL is that of Knowles (1975):

[ Self-directed learning is ]  a  process  in  which  individuals  take  the  initiative,  with or  without  the  help  of  others,  in  diagnosing  their  learning  needs,  formulating learning goals, identifying human and material resources for learning, choosing and implementing appropriate learning strategies and evaluating learning outcomes. (p. 18)

Self-directed learning entails the following prominent features (Knowles 1975):

- 1. Taking  ownership  of  learning  -  This  involves  individual  responsibility  to recognise and determine one's learning gaps and setting learning goals consistent with these learning gaps.
- 2.  Extension  of  learning  -  Students  ought  to  engage  in  cross-disciplinary work promoting collaboration with other students, which they can use to form networks among formal and informal learning (see ch. 10) occurring inside and outside of self-directed environments.
- 3.  Self-monitoring - Students should manage learning tasks, learning time and appropriate resources. They must also take action to meet their identified learning goals.

Furthermore, according to Knowles (1968a, 1968b, 1970, 1975, 1991, 1993, 1995, 1996), SDL involves nine competencies:

- 1. Accepting  the  differences  in  students  and  the  abilities  necessary  for learning in student-focused education.

- 2.  Seeing oneself as a non-dependent, self-directed individual.
- 3.  The ability to work collectively in the planning of learning and diagnosing needs.
- 4.  The  ability to  ascertain  learning  requirements  persuasively  with  the assistance of educators.
- 5.  The  ability  to  interpret  learning  requirements  that  are  important  for  the formation of learning goals.
- 6.  The ability to communicate and share with educators as facilitators and partners  in  learning  and  taking  the  initiative  to  engage  with  learning resources.
- 7. The ability to distinguish between learning resources applicable to various learning purposes.
- 8.  The ability to handpick active approaches to employ learning resources.
- 9.  The ability to self-assess the success of individual learning goals.

Educators believe that students should be more in control and accountable for their learning (Claro &amp; Loeb 2019; Du Toit-Brits 2015; Ponton &amp; Carr 2016). However,  if  educators  want  to  cultivate  more  self-directed  students,  there should  be  an  emphasis  in  learning  environments  on  the  above-listed competencies for  students  to  become  self-directed.  Self-directed  students will be  more  intrinsically motivated, interested in learning, persistent, independent, active agents in learning, self-disciplined, self-confident, goaloriented, problem-solvers and critical thinkers (Aşkin 2015; Cadorin, Bressan &amp;  Palese  2017;  Claro  &amp;  Loeb  2019).  To  embolden  self-direction  in  learning, educators should make learning more meaningful. Educators can do so by supporting the development of critical thinkers who are accountable for and in control of their learning - this is an essential product of formal education and  training  because  SDL  is  a  natural  path  to  meaningful  learning,  understanding and effectiveness (Brockett &amp; Hiemstra 1991; Hiemstra &amp; Brockett 2012; Ponton 2016; Ponton &amp; Carr 2016).

An essential requirement for SDL is a strong emphasis on student-centred learning. Educators  should  be  devoted  to  cultivating  SDL  in  learning environments where active learning is the central focus (Du Toit-Brits 2020; Sale 2018; Song &amp; Hill 2007). The prominence of SDL in individual autonomy, individual responsibility and individual development personifies some of the necessary ideologies of HEIs (Sawatsky et al. 2017).

## Adopting self-direction in learning

Embracing self-direction in learning is underpinned by four prerequisites (Tan 2017): first, there must be confidence and mutual trust between the student and educator; second, the student needs to be willing to be self-directed in their  learning;  third,  continuous  support  must  be  provided  to  students  to develop and mature in self-directing; and lastly, learning opportunities must

be  provided  to  students  to  grow  in  their  capability  and  aptitude  in  selfdirection (Du Toit-Brits 2020; Wanda 2014). Educators are required to make a paradigm  shift  before  employing  the  above-stated  prerequisites.  Such  a paradigm  shift  entails,  among  others,  that  educators  need  to  become conscious and mindful of each student's role in and accountability for the learning process (Slater, Cusick &amp; Louie 2017; Swart 2018). Students need to be educated about self-directed development, underscoring the commitment of individuals who must be involved in continuously taking responsibility for their learning (Francom 2010).

Furthermore, by adopting and promoting SDL in learning environments (Tomberg et al. 2013), students can change from just being educated to being competent,  skilled  and  accountable  individuals  (Francom  2010).  Such  a change  emphasises  the  forming  and  boosting  of  student  capabilities. Additionally,  students  can  be  supported  to  reflect  on  their  capabilities,  be specific about their learning goals and realise the benefit of transforming into self-directed individuals (Thornton 2010).

In  this  chapter,  it  is  proposed  that  the  adoption  of  self-direction  as  an approach to learning can lead to a change in HEIs, specifically concerning the improvement of educational practices (Bellanca, Paul &amp; Paul 2014; Broadbent 2017; Hiemstra &amp; Brockett 2012). Students must be willingly involved in all facets of the education process and take responsibility for their learning to improve  educational  practices  (Sawatsky  et  al.  2017;  Swart  2018).  Selfdirection in learning is an important skill, and educators need to be willing and keen to cultivate 21st-century employability skills in their learning environments (ISSDL 2020; Song &amp; Hill 2007). Also, Knowles (1996) claimed that individuals (students) could become more self-directed as they develop. Before students can become more self-directed, the learning environment needs to facilitate and promote SDL (Dynan, Cate &amp; Rhee 2008; Francom 2010).

## The contribution of the learning environment to the promotion of self-directed learning

Various  elements  should  be  explored  to  determine  what  effective  learning environments can contribute to SDL promotion (Vanslambrouck et al. 2018). Faculties can play a purposeful role in introducing and implementing SDL in HEIs  and  establishing  learning  environments  conducive  to  promoting  SDL (Guglielmino  2013;  Thomas  2018;  Williamson  &amp;  Seewoodhary  2017).  The elements  of  learning  environments  to  promote  SDL  are  discussed  in  this section.

Creating an engaging, constructive and effective learning environment for students is a key aspect of meaningful teaching (Brandt 2020; Guglielmino 2013). Generally, the emphasis is either on the physical learning environment

(e.g.  lecture  theatres  and  laboratories)  or  on  diverse  technologies  that  are employed to cultivate online learning environments (Gresham 2018; Guglielmino 2013; Thomas 2018). Cultivating an effective learning environment is epitomised by embracing (1) student characteristics, (2) educational goals, (3) learning experiences that promote active learning, (4) diverse assessment approaches  that  inform  teaching  and  learning,  and  (5)  a  learning  culture that exemplifies an engaging, constructive and practical learning environment (Charungkaittikul  2017).  Social,  physical,  psychological  and  cultural  factors (see  ch. 1) often  affect students'  learning  capabilities in the  learning environment (Boelens, De Wever &amp; Voet 2017; Fahnoe &amp; Mishra 2013). If the learning environment does not encourage the acquisition of new knowledge and SDL skills, it can be difficult for students to stay interested and involved in  the  learning  process  (Gresham  2018;  Tomberg  et  al.  2013).  Learning environments should not be regarded as a threat to students' self-directedness but  rather  as  learning  podiums  to  develop  SDL  skills  and  to  encourage advancing their growth by maturing their SDL skills and, by implication, their self-directedness (Fahnoe &amp; Mishra 2013; Sale 2018). Educators should take responsibility to integrate various approaches/elements in learning environments  that  would  support  students  in  their  journey  towards  selfdirection in learning (Porter et al. 2016). In higher education (HE) learning environments, a sense of support for self-direction in learning needs to be emboldened, which is essential to promote SDL (Pane et al. 2018). The next sub-section discusses the elements of learning environments that contribute to the promotion of SDL.

## Elements of the learning environment that contribute to the promotion of self-directed learning

In this sub-section, elements of the learning environment contributing to SDL promotion  are  discussed  to  determine  what  such  an  environment  should resemble. The below-discussed elements include embracing an SDL culture, the capability to address students' needs, the feeling of security, fostering a sense of belonging, active instructional procedures and learning resources, educators'  skills  and  roles,  collaboration,  engagement  and  connectedness, and support (Alfalah 2015; Brandt 2020). For the purpose of this chapter, only these elements are discussed.

## Embracing a self-directed learning culture

A  student-centred  learning  environment  that  embraces  an  SDL  culture emphasises the student rather than the instructor (educator). To achieve an SDL culture, students need to set their learning challenge following the general

objectives.  Those  students  who  choose  the  best  possible  technique  can manage their available time for learning opportunities by remaining motivated and capitalising on their already established skills, awareness and experiences in completing tasks (Thomas 2018). Students are characterised by something distinctive: innate drive/intrinsic motivation and self-determination for outstanding work that enable them to recognise loss of competence/lack of skill  (Acar 2014; Aşkin 2015). In HE learning environments, it is essential to build a positive learning community in which SDL can flourish. Learning needs and  student  learning  desires  are  vital  aspects  of  a  learning  community. Educators should develop an SDL culture in learning environments where (1) it increases students' creativity, (2) it builds students' self-confidence (confident behaviour) - learners trust themselves and have a sense of control over their learning, (3) it increases students' learning outcomes, (4) it supports students to practise assertiveness, (5) it can contribute to student's progress, and (6) it  supports  students  to  achieve  their  learning  goals  (Brandt  2020; Claro &amp; Loeb 2019; Gresham 2018).

That said, to promote an SDL culture in a learning environment, interactive learning  opportunities  should  be  afforded  where  students  can  learn  from each other, feel connected, while being part of (belonging to) a supportive SDL  culture  (Jubraj  2009).  Educators  need  to  be  seen  as  guides  and supporters in learning environments who provide students with the necessary support and assistance when needed (Boelens et al. 2017; UNESCO 2017). Hence,  a  learning  environment  should  be  created  that  upholds  a  strong learning  culture  where  both  students  and  educators'  expectations  are respected, and students are aware of their role and function in the learning process (Hiemstra 2013; Lopes &amp; Cunha 2017). Such learning environments can be created by encouraging educators to establish learning conditions and situations that enhance students' motivation to take ownership of their learning. Educators' expectations in the learning environment are essential to promote SDL, as 'students will respond positively to educators' enthusiasm, competence and their commitment toward SDL in the teaching and learning process' (Du Toit-Brits 2019:7-8). Educators can therefore motivate students to seek out SDL opportunities. Educators embracing an SDL culture in the learning  environment  allow  students  to  take  control  of  their  learning,  by establishing  specific  online  fora  in  learning  environments  on  learning management systems and podiums where students can discuss numerous focuses that can enable them to share their learning goals, learning needs, learning challenges and best practices and help peers (Banerjee 2013; Beach 2017; Cho et al. 2017). That said, adopting an SDL culture can decrease the educational restraints caused by traditional instruction (Tularam &amp; Machisella 2018).  This  stance  allows  educators  to  shift  from  traditional  instruction towards  an  SDL  learning  process  that  can  adjust  to  students'  numerous learning needs, designs and requests.

## Capability to address students' needs

In our diverse world, it is not a coincidence that learning environments are equally as diverse. Students come with numerous social, emotional, cognitive, language  and  learning  styles,  community  cultures  (see  ch.  1),  learning interests  and  physical  abilities  (Acar  2014;  Du  Toit-Brits  2015).  Educators need  to  afford  each  student  the  opportunity  to  thrive  in  a  learning environment where there is  an  understanding  of  and  support  for  diverse social, emotional, cognitive, language and learning styles. After all, effective learning environments originate from an understanding of the ways in which students learn. Learning environments cannot still operate as if all students and their learning needs are the same. Educators must gain an awareness of these disparities within students so that they can meet their learning needs in their learning contexts in order for all students to have success in their learning environments (whether in a school or a HEI) (Du Toit-Brits 2015; Vanslambrouck et al. 2018).

To address students' needs in learning environments, educators need to bear in mind prerequisites for student engagement and involvement, control, autonomy,  constructed  knowledge,  skills  and  attitudes,  determination  and motivation. These  are not supplementary  to  education,  but  they are fundamental for effective teaching and self-direction in learning. To promote SDL, an educator should react to students' needs through student-centred learning opportunities, creating an active and effective learning environment where students feel secure, confident, that they belong and that they have the freedom to take responsibility for their learning. Addressing students' needs ought to be underpinned by determination and reflection, which necessitates that learning is seen as an investment in their future (Brand-Gruwel et al. 2014; Gresham 2018). With an active learning approach in learning environments, students' motivation and determination to learn should be promoted, thus directing  education  on  important  information  and  materials,  supporting students in their learning process, which will support students to apply what they have learned. When implementing SDL in learning environments, students are  involved  as  'partners'  in  the  education  process,  giving  them  additional responsibility for learning. Educators' use of SDL to address students' learning needs  can  encourage  student  participation  in  learning  activities,  motivate higher-order reasoning, solve real-life problems and develop critical thinking. By so doing, students' motivation and determination to learn and their abilities and self-directedness can be enhanced.

Furthermore,  it  is  necessary  to  meet  students'  needs  in  HE  learning environments to support the development of their self-directedness and instil in  them  a  positive  and  encouraging  assertiveness  towards  self-direction  in learning  (Aşkin  2015;  Boyer  et  al.  2015).  To  promote  SDL  in  learning

environments, educators can accommodate these fundamental needs so that students  can  take  responsibility  for,  authority  over  and  ownership  of  their learning  (Knowles  1996;  Lazowski  &amp;  Hulleman  2016).  In  addition,  students should be allowed to suggest their learning objectives and outcomes (Knowles 1978). Doing so will create a rationale for why the learning is taking place and will ensure that their learning experiences are 'fruitful and creative'. Revisiting learning objective(s) is also essential to check students' understanding to feel 'safe' and confident in the self-directed environment (Hausmann et al. 2009; Kolesovs &amp; Melne 2017).

## Creating a feeling of security

The learning environment can contribute to the promotion of SDL if it provides a 'safe' podium for students to freely voice their specific learning needs, which is necessary to thrive academically (Kolesovs &amp; Melne 2017). Feeling 'safe' in such an environment goes beyond students' physical well-being; it is about listening to students' voices, making students feel free, supported and valued in  their  journey  towards  self-direction  (Lopes  &amp;  Cunha  2017).  Therefore,  in learning environments, it is essential that educators consider and uphold a positive  SDL  culture  where  students  can  feel  'safe',  resulting  in  students saying, 'I feel safe, therefore, I can learn'. An essential requirement to promote SDL is to acknowledge the importance of the emotional part of SDL in the learning environment; it should be seen as the 'foundation of learning' (Spear &amp; Mocker 1984). Students who feel 'safe' in their learning environment would develop  confidence,  motivation,  determination  and  a  sense  of  belonging, which  are  cornerstones  for  fostering  self-direction  in  learning  (Kolesovs  &amp; Melne  2017).  For  learning  environments  to  promote  SDL,  educators  must share  'power'  with  students  by  creating  safe  environments  for  rigorous learning and identifying it as an essential SDL condition (Morrison &amp; Premkumar 2014; Sale 2018). 'Feeling safe' and its role in SDL should be encompassed in learning environments where students are facilitated and encouraged to be self-directed.  In  this  regard,  Schutz  and  Lanchart  (2002)  explained  the following:

[ ]n  the  2000s,  researchers  interested  in  teaching,  learning,  and  motivational I transactions within the classroom context can no longer ignore emotional issues. Emotions  are  intimately  involved  in  virtually  every  aspect  of  the  teaching  and learning process and, therefore, an understanding of the nature of emotions within the school context is essential. (p. 67)

In  addition  to  the  above  citation  of  Schultz  and  Lanchart,  I  would  like  to suggest  that  the  emotion  of  'feeling  safe'  also  be  included  in  all  kinds  of learning and learning environments, including HEIs. I hope that this section inspires more research on the vital role of emotion in SDL.

## A sense of belonging

Learning environments should have an effective and active learning platform based on self-direction that can inaugurate collaborations and encourage an SDL culture with collaborative learning for SDL promotion. Educators need to  maintain  positive  relations  with  students,  thus  ensuring  that  there  are strong relationships between them. By so doing, trust and confidence can be established  among  students  and  between  students  and  the  educator (Hausmann et al. 2009). This argument is a cornerstone for promoting and encouraging a sense of belonging in the learning environment. A learning environment  that  promotes  SDL  instils  a  sense  of  belonging  in  students (Allen  et  al.  2018).  Students'  need  to  belong  is  essential  to  learning  in  all learning  environments  (Thomas,  Herbert  &amp;  Teras  2014;  Whitten,  James  &amp; Roberts 2017).

Belongingness is a basic human motivation, urging an individual (student) to think, learn, act and strive (Hausmann et al. 2009; Kolesovs &amp; Melne 2017). Self-directed capability is an essential element for students to find their feet in  active  SDL  environments  (Boyer  et  al.  2015).  Certain  factors  influence students' self-directedness. These factors include, but are not limited to, selfesteem, self-motivation and locus of control. In the literature (cf. Chapman et  al.  2013;  Hausmann  et  al.  2009;  Kolesovs  &amp;  Melne  2017),  a  sense  of belonging(ness) is described as students feeling safe, accepted, valued and respected as participants of a learning community  within  a  learning environment. Students need to feel connected to a learning community with a  sense  of  self-efficacy  in  the  learning  environment.  In Adler's  theory  of belongingness ,  Crandall  (1981)  stated  that,  when  students  have  a  sense  of belonging, they will have a higher 'sense of worth', improved self-confidence and self-determination, willing to take responsibility, be more motivated and have better learning expectations. Conversely, it is also true that if students do not have a sense of belonging, they will feel demotivated with little or no sense  of  control  over  and  autonomy  in  the  learning  process  and  learning environment.

This chapter proposes that a sense of belonging in learning environments can influence and embolden SDL in learning communities. Belongingness in learning environments can promote SDL skills, resulting in students developing into  autonomous,  self-esteem,  open-minded  lifelong  'owners  of  learning'. Similarly,  students  should  be  confidently  and  personally  involved  in  the learning process and be ready and willing to take ownership (thus be 'owners') of their learning. For students to be 'owners' of their learning (student agency), a sense of belonging is, therefore, a crucial factor (Kolesovs &amp; Melne 2017). Having a sense of belonging in HEIs necessitates that students be involved in the  planning  of  ownership.  They  must  be  regarded  as  planners,  teachers, professional  development  partners  and  decision-makers.  For  students  to

belong, they must also find personal value and freedom in pursuing learning, and they must understand how knowledge is valuable (Martinez-Callaghan &amp; Gill-Lacruz 2017). Building students' ownership is a characteristic that should be encouraged by educators. Educators should focus on giving students the freedom of choice regarding compiling their learning goals, learning activities, the seeking and using of learning resources, and the use of self-assessment in their learning. By so doing, students would be encouraged to use their voice in  their  learning  and  to  feel  that  they  belong  to  a  specific  self-directed community (Chapman et al. 2013). Therefore, to support students to grow and mature in taking ownership of their learning, self-directed communities must  be  established  and  SDL  activities  in  learning  environments  must  be created  to  embolden  belongingness,  thus  allowing  students'  voices  to  be heard (Strayhorn 2012; Thomas et al. 2014; Whitten et al. 2017; Yilmaz 2016). To conclude, a sense of belongingness is a necessity for SDL. Belongingness can affect SDL, and the need for belongingness can improve students' selfdirectedness.

## Active instructional procedures and learning resources

Introducing a learning environment with active instructional procedures is a concern of numerous educators. A learning environment that promotes SDL should  supply  facilities  and  assist  with  programs  on  learning  strategies, courses on SDL and workshops on 21st-century skills to support students in finding  learning  resources  (Busljeta  2013;  Hiemstra  2013;  UNESCO  2014a, 2014b). Additionally, in the learning environment, provision must be made for learning opportunities so that students can connect and obtain the support that can enable SDL (Wanda 2014). Doing so includes accessibility of technical aid  to  support  students  when  they  experience  technical  problems  and guidance on how to adjust to being more self-directed in learning.

To provide more assistance to students in active instructional procedures and learning resources, educators should provide a flexible module structure 2 to  assist  students  during  the  learning  process  and  adequately  meet  their diverse  learning  needs  (Ruys,  Van  Keer  &amp;  Aelterman  2012;  Sulistyoningsih 2020). The generation of personal links to the instructional procedures and learning  material  can  occur  with  the  possibility  of  increasing  students' motivation  to  learn.  Educators  must  consider  student  individualities  when providing a flexible module layout and structure. According to the module layout and structure, educators must plan the SDL experience to empower students to determine, assess and adapt their learning needs (Hiemstra 2013). To create a learning environment that promotes SDL, educators must further

let students determine their SDL skills so that they have more flexibility and direction in learning activities (Tan 2017).

Moreover,  educators  should  cultivate  collaboration  between  students through cooperative learning, PBL, project-based learning, adaptive prompts to facilitate metacognitive regulation and self-directed multimodal learning. Active instructional  procedures  refer  to  a  comprehensive  variety  of  instructional procedures  that  involve  students  as  active,  vigorous  contributors  in  the learning  process,  with  their  educator  as  facilitator  (Sulistyoningsih  2020). Typically,  active  instructional  approaches  involve  students  working  both collaboratively and individually. They vary from brief learning activities (e.g. journal  writing,  problem-solving  and  group  debates)  to  lengthier,  complex learning activities (e.g. case studies and structured team-based teaching and learning). Educators should use active learning strategies and learning tools to empower and encourage self-direction in learning by putting students at the centre of the learning process.

The role of active learning strategies and activities in learning environments is essential  for promoting  SDL  (Anderson,  Fukuda  &amp;  Anderson  2005; Sulistyoningsih 2020). Active learning strategies 3  need to be implemented in learning environments to encourage, stimulate and support more discourse, an enhanced understanding of the learning material and activities, that will require students to apply higher-order thinking skills (analysis, synthesis and evaluation)  (Donker  et  al.  2014;  Sulistyoningsih  2020).  Active  learning strategies  should  empower  students  with  SDL  skills  fundamental  to  the learning environment that wants to promote SDL (Brockett &amp; Hiemstra 1991). Furthermore,  it  is  imperative  that  active  learning  strategies  and  activities highlight self-direction in learning for students and assess student attainment through  a  'set  of  learning  objectives'  (Donker  et  al.  2014;  Sulistyoningsih 2020). Active learning strategies and activities in the learning environment should permit students to learn at their own pace, consistent with student learning goals, circumstances and individualities (Hiemstra 2013). However, an effective  learning  environment  is  determined  not  by  implementing  several learning  resources  but  by  an  educator  to  inspire  students  to  acquire  new knowledge, SDL skills, positive values and attitudes.

## Educators' skills and role

The learning environment can contribute to the promotion of SDL if it brings about  transformation  of  students'  and  educators'  roles,  tasks,  skills  and attitudes. Educators no longer have to be responsible for delivering learning

content to students, but they should guide and support students to discover and experience the correct learning content, identify their learning needs and set  their  learning  goals  (Brockett  &amp;  Hiemstra  1991;  Hiemstra  2013).  Each student's learning process can differ when it comes to timing, approaches, use of learning resources, learning needs and learning goals (Thomas 2018). The  role  of  educators  is,  as  a  result,  not  merely  altering  but  also  highly challenging, as they should keep up with diverse learning needs (Sale 2018). This demand relates not only to time but also to the flexibility of educators who  must  allow  for  and  support  various  means  of  working  of  students (Tomberg et al. 2013).

Educators must be competent and willing to develop learning environments that foster SDL (Brockett 1994; Brookfield 1990, 1993; Hiemstra 2013; Gresham 2018)  by  creating  stimulating  and  active  learning  environments  through optimal teaching-learning strategies. Students can be best facilitated through a personalised process to assist them to accept responsibility for and authority over  their  learning,  thus  assisting  students  to  be  more  self-directed  and academically inquisitive (Lopes &amp; Cunha 2017). This highlights educators' role and  responsibility  to  develop  learning  environments  to  promote  SDL,  and therefore, educators should be self-directed themselves (Grow 1991; Hairon &amp; Chai  2017;  Hiemstra  2013).  In  essence,  in  learning  environments  where educators use SDL skills, students tend to participate more in SDL behaviours (Alfalah 2015; Brandt 2020). Therefore, educators are encouraged to promote SDL  behaviours  and  skills  by  giving  students  learning  possibilities  to  take responsibility for their own learning, do self-assessments and contribute to designing their learning environments. However, educators need to understand the attributes of a self-directed student (individual), namely, student motivation,  goal  orientation,  self-efficacy,  locus  of  control,  self-regulation, self-management,  and  self-monitoring  and  reflection  (Aşkin  2015).  These attributes offer a structure to help students be aware of themselves as students and develop their self-awareness as self-directed students.

Because  of educators' altered roles and responsibilities in learning environments that promote SDL, learning tasks must be reformulated. Providing students  with  knowledge  is  part  of  educators'  traditional  role  but  loses significance and meaning within learning environments that aim to promote SDL. In learning environments that aim to promote SDL, the following roles and responsibilities of educators are more established (Claro &amp; Loeb 2019):

- 1. administration and organisation of the learning environment
- 2.  interrelating diverse students with comparable learning needs
- 3.  stimulating students to communicate, interact, cooperate and have selfcontrol
- 4.  facilitating and helping students with self-assessment
- 5.  facilitating and helping students with learning tasks.

To  accomplish  these  roles  and  responsibilities,  educators  should  (Francom 2010):

- 1. understand  their  new  role  and  responsibility  as  SDL  coach,  mediator, facilitator, coordinator and enthusiast
- 2.  be  the  liaison  between  educator  and  student  on  equal  grounds  in  the learning process
- 3.  have clear expectations for each student
- 4.  be able to collaborate with students
- 5.  be able to foster and nurture the growth of students to be self-directed and support them with self-responsible learning
- 6.  to  become  accustomed  to  new  active  teaching-learning  strategies  for students
- 7. show an interest in the personality of students.

To conclude, educators should share the control and ownership of teaching and learning with students. Thus, educators should not make decisions in the learning  environment;  instead,  they  should  assist  students  in  making  their own decisions and drawing their conclusions. In this section, it was proposed that  educators  need  to  initiate  the  change  from  traditional  teaching  and learning  to  SDL,  thus  taking  stewardship  of  promoting  SDL  in  learning environments.

## Collaborative learning to enhance self-directed learning

Collaborative learning entails students getting together to construct knowledge and understanding to accomplish a collective objective to enhance SDL. De Laat and Simons (2002) suggested the following in this regard:

The accelerating developments in our society make it necessary, but not sufficient, to  have  excellent  groups  of  individuals  in  a  workforce  …  people  need  to  be able  to  work  together  in  solving  problems  and  innovating  more  accurately  and more quickly. (p. 15)

According to Chang (2006), collaborative learning is an instructive method where students function collaboratively and are self-directed to elucidate a problem, complete a learning task and create meaningful learning. Collaborative learning can improve and support student academic attainment in the learning environment (Duckworth et al. 2019), and it can be deemed an essential instrument within the learning environment that supports students' SDL abilities. Abubakar and Arshad (2015) encouraged SDL and collaborative learning in learning environments because they can be successfully combined to cultivate and improve learning. When students participate in joint learning exercises,  their  'group  work  learning'  and  'self-learning'  are  enhanced  if instructors  can  support  students  in  developing  practical  skills  (Fung  &amp;  Lui  2016).

It must be acknowledged that a collaborative approach in learning is essential, as  it  supports  and  empowers  students  to  acquire  higher-order  thinking abilities that may influence on their learning outcomes.

When implementing collaborative learning in the learning environment to promote  SDL,  students  need  to  be  vigorous  contributors  to  learning. Knowledge  is,  therefore,  not  transferred  to students; it develops  and materialises from vigorous discourse and interaction between those students who  want  to  understand  and  apply  learning  concepts  and  methods  (Le, Janssen &amp; Wubbels 2018; Lee et al. 2014). Moreover, to attain effectiveness in collaborative learning in learning environments to promote SDL, group and individual goals and group and individual responsibility should be well-defined (Chang 2006; Lench, Fukuda &amp; Anderson 2015). The facilitator's role is also necessary to attain effectiveness in collaborative learning, and learning must focus  on  student-centred  learning  activities  rather  than  being  educator engrossed. Students must also be actively involved in learning by helping one another in the  learning  process  rather  than  looking  for  answers  and  explanations from  the  educator  (Ruys  et  al.  2012).  Lastly,  collaborative  learning  is  an essential and constructive instrument in the learning environment.

## Engagement through communication and interaction

Learning environments can also contribute to the promotion of SDL employing engagement through communication and interaction (Chang 2006; Hiemstra 2013).  In  education,  engagement  is  about  the  amount  of  responsiveness, inquisitiveness, interest, confidence and passion that students demonstrate while learning, which influence their responsibility, involvement, participation and level of motivation to learn (Wang &amp; Eccles 2012).

Learning  environments  that  focus  on  promoting  SDL  would  empower students to interconnect and communicate with peers and educators. Such learning environments would allow students to develop skills like problemsolving, critical thinking, conflict resolution, self-control and communication, to mention but a few (Umbach &amp; Wawrzynski 2005). Through communication and  engagement  in  learning  environments,  students  are  enabled  through learning opportunities to identify (1) their learning needs, (2) express their feelings, (3) engage and participate in the planning for their module outcomes and  assessment,  and  (4)  identify  personal  and  group  goals  (Komarraju, Musulkin &amp; Bhattacharya 2010). Through open and respectful communication, students  are  allowed  to  make  their  voices  and  opinions  heard.  A  learning environment with communication and engagement can thus be considered a 'connected'  learning  environment  that  is  collective,  interconnected  and dependable (Komarraju et al. 2010) and supports and promotes a 'productive' SDL experience.

Students often learn successfully when they cooperate and interact with each other and with educators. 'Student-to-student', 'student-to-educator' and 'student-to-content' communication and interaction are vital components of  the  learning  environment  to  promote  self-direction  in  learning  (Chang 2006).  Irrespective  of  the  learning  media  used,  HEIs  and  educators  must facilitate appropriate learning engagement and communication opportunities. Research  by  Garrison  (1997,  2003),  Moore  et  al.  (2011)  and  Song  and  Hill (2007)  highlights  three  different  interactions, 4   namely,  'learner-instructor, learner-learner and learner-content interaction'. The fourth kind of interaction identified resembles learner-interface interaction (Hillman, Willis &amp; Gunawardena 1994; Lasfeto 2020).

Interaction and engagement in the learning environment provide communication  and  critical  discussions,  which  are  essential  for  learning environments to promote SDL (Chang 2006; Hiemstra 2013; Lasfeto 2020). Interaction and engagement help students to better their capability to selfmanage  their  learning.  It  is  significant  to  increase  the  interaction  and engagement between students, learning resources and educators in an SDL environment so that the necessary support can be provided to students in order for them to take control of their learning. Students can cultivate critical thinking skills and reflect on learning content by interacting. Interaction pays an essential role in promoting SDL in learning environments and educators and students' willingness to engage in SDL (Komarraju et al. 2010). Interaction is thus fundamental to increase the mastery of skills and knowledge needed for SDL in learning environments.

## Support

Student  support  contributes  to  the  promotion  of  SDL  in  the  learning environment. Support entails what the educator can or should do to support students over and above the formal facilitation of learning content and SDL skills development. Student support has various purposes; however, this is not the focus of this chapter. In this chapter, the emphasis is on showing why support is a necessary element of the learning environment to promote SDL.

All students can be self-directed by nature (Brandt 2020; Fahnoe &amp; Mishra 2013)  but  they  may  have  distinct  learning  needs.  Thus,  educators  are responsible  for  assisting  students  in  their  learning  by  supporting  them  to determine their learning needs while still acknowledging the significance, role and responsibility of students to decide what they wish and need to learn. Students  need  support  in  learning  the  skills  required  to  implement  selfdirection in learning effectively. However, creating learning opportunities for

student control is more critical than the content to be learned (Hiemstra 1991; Pane  et  al.  2018).  Drawing  on  the  work  of  Brockett  and  Hiemstra  (1991), Brookfield (1990, 1993), Hiemstra (2013) and Knowles (1969, 1975, 1984), the general  approach  of  self-direction  in  learning  must  be  geared  towards establishing a self-directed climate and culture in which students can take control of and authority over what and how they learn.

Students differ immensely in their need for support in SDL. Higher education students can be self-managed, self-monitored, autonomous students, recognising what they need to learn and how best to do this (Charungkaittikul 2017). In contrast, students may lack SDL skills and may lack self-confidence, self-management, self-monitoring and motivation in their learning. The latter students  would  require  more  support  to  succeed  in  SDL.  That  said,  most students are uncertain of the expected learning standards, which necessitates educators to be transparent about their progress. Students should be given a chance to (1) control what they wish to learn, (2) grow and develop in selfdirection, (3) embark on self-direction in learning, (4) determine the pace and efficiency of their self-direction in learning, and (5) govern how they would assess,  determine  and  show  their  learning  attainment  and  growth  in  their learning goals (Brandt 2020; Pane et al. 2018).

Students need to outline their learning goals, and they need to be supported and encouraged (by an educator) to think about and reflect on their learning strategies  to  support  their  growth  to  be  self-directed  in  their  learning (Charungkaittikul 2017). Research also shows that educator support is linked to student learning success (Brockett 1994; Brookfield 1990; Hiemstra 2013; Knowles 1975, 2013; Tough 1971).

Higher  education  institutions  do  not  always  comprehend  that  students need the support to develop into independent self-directed students. Students need to be supported in their journey towards self-directedness if they are not self-directed in their learning. It must also be noted that an educator needs to provide support to students in order for them to grow in their self-directedness (Hairon  &amp;  Chai  2017).  Furthermore,  student  support  requires  self-directed educators with in-depth SDL knowledge. The need for student support cannot just  be  wished  away,  and  the  importance  of  student  support  for  student success  is  not  consistently  recognised.  However,  HEIs  comprise  diverse student populations, and educators must deal with students who need support (Fahnoe  &amp;  Mishra  2013). Lastly, establishing a supportive relationship (connectedness) with students is one of the best forms of support that can be provided (Klem &amp; Connell 2004) in learning environments to promote SDL.

To conclude, in this section, the elements that contribute to the promotion of SDL in the learning environment were elucidated. These elements must be purposely conveyed in a learning environment. Self-direction in the learning environment relies  significantly  on  these  elements:  knowledge,  proficiency,

trustworthiness,  authority,  motivation  and  trust  between  the  self-directed educator and students (Hagen &amp; Park 2016). The challenge is to convey these elements in learning environments in which there are enthusiasm, willingness and  preparedness  for  SDL  (Lasfeto  2020).  Consequently,  learning  in  HEIs should  be  deep  and  lasting  and  should  guide  and  accelerate  students' development from dependence to self-direction and independence in their learning. However, problems could arise when a one-size-fits-all tactic, which does not acclimatise to each student's need to develop into a self-directed individual, is implemented in the learning environment. Therefore, HEIs should design learning environments that contribute to the promotion of SDL. As seen from the above discussion, outlining prerequisites supporting HE learning environments is essential to promote SDL.

## Conclusion

This  chapter  discussed  elements  of  the  learning  environment  that  can contribute  to  the  promotion  of  SDL.  These  elements  can  be  seen  as prerequisites for HE learning environments to promote SDL. Higher education institutions  that  are  truly  dedicated  and  committed  to  providing  active instruction need to enhance and promote SDL in their learning environments. Self-directed  learning  can  be  promoted  in  learning  environments  by  (1) embracing an SDL culture, (2) addressing students' needs, (3) making students and educators feel secure, (4) fostering a sense of belonging, (5) employing active teaching-learning strategies and activities, (6) supporting educators' skills and roles, (7) focusing on collaboration, (8) providing opportunities for engagement and connectedness, and (9) providing continuous support. It is proposed that innovative, dependable learning environments with a socioconstructivist-inspired  understanding  of  learning  be  created  in  HEIs  where the relationship between educators and students needs to be bidirectional in order  for  students  to  have  the  freedom  to  take  ownership  of  the  learning process.

## Diluted self-directed multimodal learning guidelines: Probing online study advice in the context of panic pedagogy

Jako Olivier

Research Unit Self-Directed Learning, Faculty of Education, North-West University, Mahikeng, South Africa

## Abstract

In this chapter, online study advice regarding the shift from face-to-face to multimodal learning was investigated in terms of the requirements related to self-directed multimodal learning. This publicly posted advice comes within a broader  worldwide  shift  to  a  multimodal  mode  of  delivery  because  of restrictions in terms of the COVID-19 pandemic. In the context of this research, multimodal learning involved learning online that would also include different modes  of  communication.  Consequently,  the  theoretical  background  of

How to  cite: Olivier,  J.,  2021,  'Diluted  self-directed  multimodal  learning  guidelines:  Probing  online  study advice in the context of panic pedagogy', in E. Mentz, D. Laubscher &amp; J. Olivier (eds.), Self-Directed Learning: An imperative for education in a complex society (NWU Self-Directed Learning Series Volume 6), pp. 45-70, AOSIS, Cape Town. https:/ /doi.org/10.4102/aosis.2021.BK279.03

multimodality is highly relevant to this chapter. This chapter also probed the scholarship  around  SDL.  This  qualitative  study  involved  textual  analysis  of specifically  selected  online  texts  that  provided  guidance  towards  creating multimodal learning environments. The data analysis of the corpus collected for this chapter was done employing thematic content analysis. The content analysis informed a description of the trends of the online study advice and allowed  for  the  advice  in  terms  of  self-directed  multimodal  learning  to  be evaluated.  From  the  analysis,  it  was  evident  that  the  online  study  advice corresponded broadly with the relevant scholarship and showed evidence of reification  and  support  of  many  principles  associated  with  self-directed multimodal learning.

## Introduction

The context of the so-called panic pedagogy or panic-gogy (Carver 2020), which is prevalent worldwide because of the COVID-19 pandemic, has had a significant effect on learning through technology. Furthermore, this situation has given rise to some individuals and institutions posting guidelines or advice online towards supporting the transition from face-to-face to online learning. In  this  context  as  Lee  and  Mori  (2020:1)  observed,  'many  students  have mastered how to be taught, but rarely learned how to learn' and we now enter a time where students can potentially master how to be taught online, but still not learn regardless of the mode of learning delivery.

Even before this pandemic, providing and looking for advice online has become an increasingly common phenomenon (Wingate et al. 2020), and the sudden transition to a multimodal learning environment has also led to a proliferation of online advice for teachers. The word 'teacher' is used in this chapter as a synonym for lecturers although in some instances in the context of the analysed texts parents can also fulfil this role. In this context, experts  and  online  communities  go  through  a  process  of  reification (cf.  Introne  &amp;  Goggins  2019)  or  simplification  to  then  provide  succinct guidelines for online publication. This research focused on whether such guidelines adhered to the basic principles associated with the theoretical foundations of 'multimodal learning' (Bezemer &amp; Kress 2016; Canale 2019; Jewitt  2013;  Olivier  2020a,  2020b;  Wentzel  &amp;  Jacobs  2004)  and  'SDL' (Bosch,  Mentz  &amp;  Goede  2019;  Brockett  &amp;  Hiemstra  2019;  Gibbons  2002; Knowles 1975; Mentz et al. 2018; Zhu, Bonk &amp; Doo 2020). Furthermore, this chapter links up with scholarship focused on online public advice (cf. Sillence &amp; Briggs 2007; Zaman et al. 2020).

In this chapter, the concept of 'self-directed multimodal learning' (SDML) is probed in terms of the identified online sources. The concept of SDML refers specifically to a pedagogical approach that aims at fostering self-directedness

by  accommodating  the  individual  student  modal  preferences,  supporting communication for learning through various modalities as well as the blending of the learning, teaching and delivery processes through different modalities (Olivier 2020a, 2020b).

## Problem statement

The identified problem investigated within this chapter is how elements of SDML are realised or diluted (or not) within selected online advice texts that focus on the shift from face-to-face to online learning.

Central  to  this  research  is  the  fact  that  '[t]o  help  students  become independent in their learning, teachers need to consider how to improve SDL competencies of learners' (Lee &amp; Mori 2020:3). Moreover, the context of this research is described by Carver (2020) as follows:

The  idea  of  being  able  to  just  take  what  you  have  been  doing  in  a  face  to  face classroom and dropping it into an online  course  shell  has  its  own  problems.  But attempting this transition in the midst of a pandemic creates other problems. (p. 134)

The  exceptional  circumstances  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic  make  online information very relevant and its accuracy is important. However, the reliability of information in general and, especially, online has been questioned already in  the  past,  especially  within  the  current  milieu  of  the  'post-truth  world' (Mackey 2019:2).  In  this  regard,  Mackey  (2019:1)  noted  that  'during  a  time when truth  is  seen  as  mutable',  consumers  of  knowledge  should  have  'an unwavering commitment to the responsible and ethical participation in social networks and the critical reflection on how information is produced, shared, and consumed'. Drawing from this approach to information, in this chapter the  nature  of  online  study  advice  about  the  shift  from  face-to-face  to multimodal learning has to be explored, especially regarding its adherence to requirements related to multimodal and SDL. The research question posed for this chapter is as follows: How are elements of SDML realised within selected online advice texts that focus on the shift from face-to-face to online learning?

## Literature review

## Reductionism and online advice

The concept of reductionism is pertinent to online advice when contextually related to a move from more traditional face-to-face learning and teaching towards multimodal learning and within an SDML context where SDL is the target.

Reductionism has long been relevant in the education context. The term is notably used in different contexts and also in reference to various phenomena

(Dupré 2000). In this chapter, reductionism refers to extracting and reducing information. For Dupré (2000:402), within the context of the philosophy of science,  reductionism  refers  to  'the  thesis  that  all  scientific  truth  should ultimately be explicable, in principle at least, by appeal to fundamental laws governing the behaviour of microphysical particles'. Reductionism has been applied  in  different  fields  and  contexts.  In  this  regard,  El-Sakran  (2019) explored textual reductionism through shortening research articles to posters. Similarly, broad pedagogical concepts are reduced in the creation of online advice texts.

The concept of advice is understood as 'suggestions and recommendations with regard to future action' (Lindholm 2019:8). On a linguistic level, advice can be approached in terms of speech acts where it can be considered a directive or request (Lindholm 2019). In this chapter, advice is considered in online  texts  where  the  content  is  described  as  practical  tips,  guidelines, considerations or principles.

As stated before, the focus was specifically on online advice. Feng, Zhu and Malloch (2018:364) defined online advice 'as recommendations about what to do, think, or feel to cope with a situation faced by an individual or small group' which is also 'a form of supportive communication' and which has been 'a sought or provided through the Internet'. However, Briggs et al. (2002:331) crucially observed that '[t]he Internet is already exerting a huge influence on society, and there are few regulatory bodies to monitor the accuracy  of  online  content'.  According  to  Feng  et  al.  (2018),  support  is exchanged through discussion fora, social networking websites and other platforms.  However,  most  of  the  texts  used  in  the  corpus  researched  in this chapter  were  published  on  websites  and  not  taken  from  social networking sites.

Despite  limited  publications  on  the  nature  of  online  study  advice regarding SDML, some research has been conducted on online advice in other fields. This research includes work regarding advice on digital media use (Zaman et al. 2020), online advice for mothers and expecting mothers (Lindholm 2019), mental illness (Brookes &amp; Harvey 2016), health support (Introne &amp; Goggins 2019) as well as health and financial advice (Sillence &amp; Briggs  2007).  However,  some  of  the  literature  regarding  online  advice focuses more on some form of individualised therapeutic or curative advice (cf. Feng et al. 2018; Wingate et al. 2020), while the focus in this chapter is more on a generic, one-way type of advice posted online. It is common for  research  on  advice  to  focus  on  medical  and  health-related  issues; however, there has also been research conducted in educational contexts (Lindholm 2019).

Despite  most  early  research  on  advice  being  conducted  in  face-to-face settings, it is clear that this type of research is also increasingly being done in online contexts (Lindholm 2019). The effect of online study advice is relevant to  this  research.  In  this  regard,  Briggs  et  al.  (2002)  noted  that  people  are increasingly influenced by online advice and that source credibility, personalisation, as well as predictability are instrumental in whether the advice would be followed or not. Online advice also varies between expert advice that can be requested to static information published online (Lindholm 2019; Sillence &amp; Briggs 2007). The data used in this chapter pertain to the latter type of online advice.

## Multimodal learning

For the sake of this chapter, multimodal learning is understood mainly in terms of the levels of individual, interactional and instructional multimodality (Olivier 2020a). The focus here is on learning that takes place through the use of online modalities. Furthermore, the chapter draws on the principles underpinning  multimodality  (Bezemer  &amp;  Kress  2016;  Canale  2019;  Jewitt, Bezemer &amp; O'Halloran 2016; Kress 2010) and online learning (Cope &amp; Kalantzis 2017;  Garrison  2017;  Moreno  &amp;  Mayer  2007;  Picciano  2019).  The  focus  of multimodal  learning  is  not  just  on  how  technology  is  integrated  into  the learning process but also on the semantic and semiotic resources employed in the process.

Increased  use  of  technology  in  the  wider  education  context  has  consequently led to more opportunities for multimodal learning. Garrison (2017:1) observed that  '[r]ethinking  conventional  education  in  light  of  technological  developments and the need for higher-order educational outcomes is shaking the foundation of the educational enterprise'. However, in a sudden move to online learning, as was the case with COVID-19, differences between face-to-face and online learning were emphasised, and this situation made the option of using blended learning obsolete for a while. In harking back to Garrison's remark above, the educational foundations have not just been shaken, but irrevocably changed possibly even changed forever. Hence, taking a snapshot of the online study advice at this time provides an insight into how experts and, to a lesser extent, popular  writers  regard  the  way  this  transition  should  have  taken  place. Nevertheless, through this process, the multimodal nature of learning became more prominent.

The level of individual  multimodality (Olivier  2020a,  2020b) also seems highly relevant in online learning contexts. In support of this view, Kizilcec, Bailenson and Gomez (2015:737) found in their research regarding instructional videos that their 'findings highlight learning preference as a critical individual

difference to consider in the design of multimedia instruction'. This level of multimodality also alludes to the importance of differentiated, individualised and  possibly  even  adapted  approaches  for  consideration  within  an  online environment. However, such approaches would firstly rely on sophisticated learning  environments  and  learning  management  systems  and  secondly require  sufficient  data  collected  from  students  throughout  the  process followed up by pedagogically driven analytics.

Regarding  interactional  multimodality,  modes  of  communication  also pertain to online learning. Despite the affordances of using different modes of communication in learning through attending to different learner preferences, it is essential to consider cognitive load. Therefore, the learner is dependent on  the  intrinsic,  extraneous  and  germane  cognitive  load  not  exceeding  a student's  working  memory  resources  (Kizilcec  et  al.  2015;  Sweller,  Van Merriënboer &amp; Paas 2019).

Finally, in terms of instructional multimodality, the blending of face-to-face and online learning has increasingly become a feature of HE. However, in this chapter,  the  focus  is  specifically  on  online  learning.  The  online  learning environment is also multimodal in nature as different modes of communication are combined within learning management systems. Multimodal learning is furthermore combined within the concept of SDML in this chapter, and SDL as a construct is thus also considered.

## Self-directed learning

The approach to SDL in this chapter ties in with the extensive scholarship on this phenomenon (Bosch et al. 2019; Brockett &amp; Hiemstra 2019; Gibbons 2002; Knowles 1975; Mentz et al. 2018). For Gibbons (2002), SDL involved:

[ A ]ny increase in knowledge, skill, accomplishment, or personal development that an individual selects and brings about by his or her own efforts using any method in any circumstances at any time. (p. 2)

This definition not only emphasises both knowledge and skill but also makes the personal aspirational aspect prominent. Furthermore, as with the classical definition by Knowles (1975), for Gibbons, SDL is a process through which an individual  takes  charge  and  determines  how  it  is  conducted.  Prevalently, Merriam and Bierema (2014) described SDL as being a process and a personal attribute as follows:

SDL as a personal attribute refers to an individual predisposition toward this type of learning, and comfort with autonomy in the learning process. SDL as a process is an approach to learning that is controlled by the learner. (p. 63)

In this context, the attribute and the process are relevant to the discussion as these aspects also informed the analysis of the online study advice.

## Methodology

## Research design and paradigm

This  qualitative  research,  which  was  conducted  within  an  interpretivist paradigm  (Tracy  2020:51),  explored  public  online  study  advice  regarding SDML. This research demonstrated a basic qualitative study (Merriam 2009). The type of textual analysis, conducted in this chapter, is also commonly used in similar qualitative studies (Tracy 2020).

## Sampling

This research involved purposive sampling of publicly available online study advice  regarding  multimodal  learning  as  posted  online  from  the  period  of January to October 2020 by various institutions and individuals. This period was specifically selected to coincide with an increase of such posts related to a  worldwide  move  to  online  delivery  modes  of  learning  because  of  the COVID-19 pandemic.

To inform the data collection process, the inclusion criteria employed on a search engine included: (1) openly published webpages, (2) from the period noted above, (3) written in English, and (4) with a thematic focus on providing tips or advice for online learning and transitions to this mode of delivery. After a  wide  search,  the  number  of  identified  texts  was  reduced,  through  the addition of additional keywords limiting the search to online advice related to COVID-19  and  multimodal  contexts,  from  176  to  the  12  sources  that  were ultimately chosen for this research based on them adhering to the inclusion criteria, being text-based and substantial enough for linguistic and content analysis. The selected documents were copied into text documents for the aim of analysis.

## Data collection

A process of searching, screening and data analysis was followed, much along the same vein as the online research by Zaman et al. (2020). In approaching the stated online study advice or guidelines, this research was done within the context of metaliteracy; the researcher thus assumed the role of a metaliterate researcher who 'is a critical consumer of information, continuously developing effective questions, verifying sources of information including authorship, and always  challenging  his  or  her  own  biases  through  metacognitive  thinking' (Mackey 2019:1).

The advantages and challenges regarding research with online documents have been clearly described by Merriam (2009). In addition, it is evident from this source that limiting research to online texts excludes certain views and

allows for certain biases in terms of the search mechanism to be employed. Most  of  the  sources  consulted  were  labelled  as  advice  guides  or  articles, although some were institutionally created support documents.

In Table 3.1, the corpus is summarised in terms of the abbreviations used in this chapter, the bibliographical references, types of sources as well as the number of words.

## Data analysis

The first level of analysis focused on meaning by exploring the nature of the content in the identified texts and the semantic value of online study advice regarding SDML within the corpus. Finally, the content itself was then analysed inductively (cf.  Merriam 2009) in terms of how the subject matter agreed, diverged  or  extended  related  aspects  from  the  scholarship  on  multimodal learning and SDL. Trustworthiness was ensured through detailed description of the data collection and analysis processes that were followed and the use of two iterations of analysis by the researcher.

## Research ethics

Various online sources were considered for this study; however, for the sake of research ethics, only documents that were openly published on websites were considered.  Moreover,  for  the  sake  of  privacy  and  confidentiality,  no  texts were taken from social media or any comments added to websites by users (in cases where comments were possible) were considered or even copied in

the  raw  analysis  documents.  As  per  national  guidelines,  as  in  this  case '[r]esearch that relies exclusively on publicly available information or accessible through  legislation  or  regulation  usually  need  not  undergo  formal  ethics review' (Department of Health 2015:8).

Importantly, Tracy (2020:115) observed that '[w]hen analyzing online data, it  is  important  for  researchers  to  carefully  consider  privacy  policies  and people's likely expectation for their work being used in research'. Consequently, this research focused only on openly published online study advice as a data source. Furthermore, throughout the process, research ethics requirements in terms of online content (cf. Whiteman 2012) were adhered to.

## Results

From the analysis, it was evident that broadly the online study advice regarding SDML agreed with the relevant scholarship and showed evidence of reification. However, there were instances where such advice would be reductionist or focused on a specific context.

Some broad categories were also identified as some sources focused on general advice (OAS1, OAS3, OAS4, OAS5, OAS6, OAS7, OAS9, OAS10, OAS11 and OAS12), while others listed a number of specific resources or applications (OAS2) or even advice specific to an institution (OAS1, OAS7, OAS8 and OAS9). Some sources are also a bit more focused on a specific field, such as OAS11, which provides general advice but also elements specifically related to the medical context.

Initially, corpus linguistic software, AntConc 3.5.8, was employed to probe the texts in terms of word frequency. A summary of the top five lexical words related to the focus of this chapter is listed per source in Table 3.2. Proper nouns are excluded.

The words in the table are listed in order of frequency: from highest to lowest and the frequency presented in brackets after each word. The values have been normalised to 1000 words to make comparison possible.

The summary of the top five relevant lexical words per online advice source clearly shows the central role of students (or 'learner') in all the texts. However, this does not necessarily imply a student-centred approach. The terms 'online' and 'learning' are also prominent as these were key terms used in searching for the sources. However, from Table 3.2, it is also possible to determine the prominence of teachers (OAS2), parents (OAS2), videos (OAS3 and OAS10), teaching  (OAS4),  feedback  (OAS5),  assessment  (OAS7  and  OAS8)  and interaction (OAS9). For a text specialising in a specific field, the term 'medical' (OAS11) was also prominent.

An SDML scorecard, as shown in Table 3.3, was developed by the researcher, based  on  key  sources  on  SDL  and  multimodal  learning,  and  the  analysed sources were measured against this scorecard.

From  the  SDML  scorecard,  most  sources  emphasise  a  relationship  and environment  conducive  to  learning.  However,  when  it  comes  to  specific elements of SDL, only selected sources overtly referred to relevant aspects. Furthermore, student-centredness, interaction, active and interactive learning were also quite prominent. Nearly, all the sources highlighted the importance of collaboration. Within the context of multimodal learning, the emphasis was on sources recommending the use of different modes of communication and the integration of different modes of delivery in instruction.

Demirel (2018).

OAS, online advice source.

from  maintaining  a  social,  cognitive  and  teaching  presence,  most  other aspects related to multimodality were not present in most sources.

In the analysis, specific attention was also paid to principles of planning lessons for SDL as identified by Gibbons (2002:43-45) and how they were realised or not within the advice:

- · each students the skills they need to take control of their learning activities. T
- · Shift the emphasis of the program from content to productivity.
- · Introduce new practices in gradual gradients of complexity.
- · Make new ideas familiar by connecting them to students' lives.
- · Develop in students the attitudes necessary for success.
- · Change from telling to asking and from lecturing to interaction.
- · Launch the student on a hero's journey of discovery.

These principles generally resonate with content drawn from the online advice sources (OASs). Prompting students to take control of their learning is noted (OAS4, OAS5, OAS7 and OAS9) while supporting them to be able to do it  (OAS10). The focus is shifted from the content to doing something in an incrementally  complex  way  (OAS9).  Linking  new  knowledge  with  prior knowledge  (OAS9  and  OAS11)  and  the  real  world  (OAS11)  is  definitely supported by the sources. A shift in emphasis from teaching to learning in an active manner is also evident. Finally, placing students and their motivation and  aspirations  central  to  the  learning  process  is  key  to  online  learning success according to the OASs (OAS1, OAS3, OAS4, OAS7 and OAS9).

Several  broad  themes  were  evident  in  the  analysis,  and  they  are  briefly discussed below.

## Accessibility

An  important  aspect  is  having  access  not  just  to  the  multimodal  online environments but also to the resources themselves. This pertains to physical access (OAS12) and also to the type of document, graphics or video file used. Also, being able to print resources also relate to this aspect as in some cases, students might not have constant Internet access or have a preference for a resource  in  a  printed  medium.  It  was  suggested  in  OAS8  that  content  be available  not  just  online  and  that  teachers  are  encouraged  to  '[p]resent materials (in PDF format) and activities (in Word format) in your module to enable students to download and work offline' (UJ 2020:1).

Relating  to  accessibility  is  also  supporting  students  who  might  have problems accessing information and also coping within the new environment (OAS4). These issues also relate to a broader emphasis on no and low-tech environments.

## No and low-tech approach

The  literature  supports  the  need  for  the  so-called  no  or  even  low-tech approaches when moving to a multimodal environment (Carver 2020). The main reason for this approach is that there are, not only in South Africa but also globally, inequalities in terms of access to digital technologies (Carver 2020).  A  number  of  sources  emphasised  low-tech  or  other  approaches that  were  not  Internet  data-usage  intensive  (OAS3,  OAS7,  OAS8  and OAS10).

Within this theme, the analysed sources highlighted that videos should be short (OAS3, OAS8 and OAS10) and can be accessed on phones (OAS3 and OAS7) and that transcriptions of video content be included (OAS8). In OAS8, it  is  suggested that teachers '[k]eep online learning design simple and not data intensive' (UJ 2020:1). In OAS7, the preference for low data solutions is expressly mentioned (UJ 2020):

[ A ]ll  lecturers will to some extent use in-video assessment or YouTube links. If a low data solution, eg [ sic ] PDF file or Discussion Board, will assist the students in reaching the module outcomes, consider using these options instead. (p. 3)

Consequently, teachers should ensure accessible content on different mobile devices and not just computers.

In  terms  of  video  length,  most  sources  just  indicated  they  are  short. However,  in  OAS8,  specific  maximum  duration  guidelines  are  provided (UJ 2020):

- · Recorded lectures: 3-5 min.
- · Virtual sessions: a maximum of 6 min.
- · Voice-over PowerPoints of under 5 min.

Despite  the  useful  guidelines,  this  specific  document  seems  to  contradict itself with some overlap and conflicting guidelines such as the indication that initially information  should  be  limited  and  be  manageable  versus  the recommendation  that  as  much  material  as  possible  be  made  available. However, the essence of keeping videos short seems to be clear and in line with  the  literature  (cf.  Olivier  2019a).  Similarly,  OAS10  also  recommends limiting pre-recorded videos to 2-min - 6-min segments and emphasises the importance of good audio above video or images in terms of quality.

Technology should be in support of pedagogical goals and not be a goal in itself. In addition, the use of technology should also not become a barrier. To  support  these  two  statements,  OAS8  proposes  that  teachers  '[u]se technology with the purpose to support your teaching and your students' learning:  the  simpler,  the  better'  (UJ  2020:2).  The  use  of  technology  is determined  by  the  structure  and  preceding  process  planning  involved  in multimodal learning.

## Structure and planning

With  a  move  towards  multimodal  learning,  teachers  are  encouraged  to implement a clear structure, divide content strategically and scaffold. What might be missing from the sources is that students should play an active role in planning learning as is required for SDML. In this regard, certain structural and planning aspects were evident in the corpus, as is shown in Table 3.4.

Outlines and expectations should be set out in a straightforward manner, and  content  should  be  made  manageable  in  terms  of  volume  and  order. Furthermore, teachers are encouraged to regularly engage with students and also  keep  communication  channels  open  by  engaging  with  students  and through bidirectional feedback. However, many multimodal aspects of SDML were  apparent,  as  is  shown  below  in  terms  of  asynchronous  and  flipped classroom approaches.

It is suggested that learning should be asynchronous (OAS1, OAS3, OAS4, OAS6 and OAS8), although in at least one source (OAS11) synchronous online discussions  and  also  asynchronous  online  tutorials  are  preferred.  Although practical,  an  asynchronous  approach  can  be  detrimental  in  terms  of  the immediacy,  active  and  collaborative  nature  of  the  learning  taking  place. However,  it  is  apparent  from  the  literature  that  both  asynchronous  and synchronous learning have different advantages and contexts where they are most appropriate (Hrastinski 2008; Ogbonna, Ibezim &amp; Obi 2019). In OAS6, it is  also noted that teachers should not rely on live video as there might be technical challenges.

OAS, online advice source.

As shown in Table 3.4, a flipped classroom approach is a recommended way to  handle  online  classes.  From  the  literature,  it  is  clear  that  a  flipped classroom approach, where traditional classroom activities in terms of content are conducted at home and homework or application is handled in the class, has advantages in terms of improving learning performance (Akçayır &amp; Akçayır 2018;  Strelan,  Osborn  &amp;  Palmer  2020).  In  this  regard,  OAS11  recommends (Sandars et al. 2020):

[ A ]  flipped  classroom approach should be used with learning activities, such as reading a book chapter or journal articles or watching a video, before the online lecture and with interactive learner activities and opportunities to ask questions about the pre-learning during the lecture. (n.p.)

From the advice in the sources, it is evident that the online content should be structured so that it is easily navigable for students. To this end, in OAS8 it is urged that teachers structure their 'online module in a clear, logical way that will make it easy for students to navigate and find what they need to learn' and that a 'clear learning guide/path' is provided to students (UJ 2020:1). An essential aspect for both SDL and multimodal learning is resources.

## Resources and reuse

The  OASs  provided  little  information  regarding  students'  roles  in  resource selection. However, the multimodal nature of resources for online learning was evident. From the analysis, it emerged that content might need to be divided or  grouped  into  smaller  sections.  In  this  regard,  it  is  posed  in  OAS8  that teachers  can  '[d]ivide  topics  or  themes  into  smaller,  more  manageable assessments or assignments that require less reading and research time online and more application and critical thinking skills' (UJ 2020:2).

The issue of reusing material can be associated with an open pedagogy approach and open educational resources (OER) (Olivier 2019a, 2020b). The analysed sources also supported the concept of reuse of resources (OAS1, OAS3 and OAS7). OAS11 references curation of open resources in terms of videos and also notes that for any student-created content (Sandars et al. 2020):

[ ]f  the  resource is of suitable quality and does not breach copyright, making it I available as an open educational resource (OER) to benefit learners beyond the institution should be considered. (n.p.)

In  OAS1,  the  following  is  noted:  'There  is  not  much  time  to  prepare.  What resources from previous years can you reuse? What external resources are available?' (UCT 2020). OAS3 and OAS7 even stated that OERs be considered which would also be relevant for easy and free sharing.

However, what lacked from the sources in terms of SDML  was recommendations  regarding  students  selecting  an  appropriate  resource.

The  sources  did  not  only  refer  to  resources  but  also  refer  to  the  learning process and how it should be active.

## Promoting active learning

Active  learning  is  noted  explicitly  in  OAS3  and  OAS9.  It  is  suggested  that students  can  be  encouraged  to  address  specific  issues  or  watch  specific sections in videos prompted by teacher instructions (OAS3). For OAS9, '[s] tudent-content interaction is all about having students DO something with the course content or topic' (OSU Center for Teaching and Learning 2020). Hence, the emphasis is on students actively taking part in their own learning through doing which resonates with what is expected within SDML.

As within the context of OAS9, merely reading or listening, which implies receiving  information  passively,  might  not  lead  to  students  engaging  and reaching outcomes, and consequently, active learning is recommended to be followed by some form of reflection. Such reflective practices have, according to the literature (Gencel &amp; Saracaloglu 2018), the potential to support SDL and by implication SDML. In this regard, Lee and Mori (2020) found that reflective practice can be considered a significant predictor of students' competencies regarding SDL. In OAS11, reflection is also mentioned, and it is indicated that it starts with a so-called a moment of surprise (Sandars et al. 2020) which can be prompted by students lacking specific knowledge or skills and that such a process should be supported through teacher facilitation.

Prompting  problem-solving  is  mentioned  only  to  a  lesser  extent  in  the corpus  of  OASs.  For  example,  in  OAS10,  teachers  are  advised  to  '[a]sk  a thought provoking question' and '[c]reate curiosity and a compelling reason for  watching  the  entire  instructional  recording'  (Kapp  2020).  The  narrow association  between  SDL  and  problem-solving  ability  is  also  noted  in  the literature (Havenga et al. 2013; Kim &amp; Shim 2018; Luo et al. 2019).

The social aspect of learning is also crucial to SDML as SDL does not imply learning in isolation (Brockett &amp; Hiemstra 2019).

## Establishing and maintaining a social presence

In SDML, social interaction is essential as, in terms of SDL, Knowles (1975:18) highlighted  that  students  should  be  able  to  identify  'human  and  material resources for learning'. However, the perception exists that student independence would be at the cost of collaboration. From the sources, the importance of independent learning for students was also raised (OAS12).

Online technology opens more avenues for interaction between teachers and students, and within a sudden move to an online environment, it is clear that compensation is required for the social interaction associated with the

face-to-face  environment.  But  in  the  OASs,  there  were  clear  elements  of reductionism of complex collaborative learning aspects.

Many of the sources promoted the idea that teachers need to check in with students and have continuous contact (OA2, OAS4, OAS6, OAS7, OAS8 and OAS12).  It  was  further  stated  that  obtaining  continuous  feedback  from students can also inform practice (OAS4, OAS6, OAS7 and OAS8). Essentially, as is stated in OAS10, '[t]he human connection is key' (Kapp 2020), and this needs to be supported in an online context.

Teachers' concerns regarding engagement are worded as follows in OAS2: 'One of the biggest concerns for teachers is how they will continue to engage students and keep an eye on their progress from afar' (FutureLearn 2020). In response to such a concern, a practical recommendation made in OAS7 is that '[g]roup cohesion is enhanced by addressing students by name if you respond to a post, using inclusive pronouns such as we, us, our group and the use of salutations'  (UP  2020:4).  Another  suggestion  in  OAS11  is  that  if  a  learning management system 'has an audience-response component, this can be used to increase learner engagement in the activities and to maximise the learning opportunity'; otherwise, questions can be posed directly (Sandars et al. 2020). In OAS10, it is proposed that questions are put to online classes to prompt conversation.

Furthermore,  on  a  practical  level,  OAS1  makes  the  following  recommendation: 'Use icebreakers, the discussion forum and chatroom where possible to give that feeling of connection' (UCT 2020). However, some sources indicated that direct  teaching  through  online  group  communication  should  be  avoided (OAS3); hence, this is also in support of a more student-centred approach as is relevant for SDML.

Establishing or maintaining social interaction between students and not only from the teacher is also important. In OAS6, the following recommendation is made: 'Make sure students support each other. Don't try to do everything yourself' (Gewin 2020). Within OAS9, these questions are posed (OSU Center for Teaching and Learning 2020):

[ H ]ow will students work together to ensure that they feel like part of a learning community and have the opportunity to collaborate, think critically, be intellectually challenged, and make meaning with others? (p. 296)

and  '[h]ow  can  students  work  with  others  while  isolated  in  their  homes?' (OSU  Center  for  Teaching  and  Learning  2020).  OAS9  also  highlights  the advantage  of  creating  a  learning  community  and  engaging  higher-order thinking through student-student interaction.

This collaboration, which is essential for SDML, also implies that different modes of communication and interaction, and consequently, the multimodal

nature  of  online  environments,  are  crucial.  This  was  also  evident  from  the analysed sources.

## Different formats as well as modes of interaction and instruction

Because of connectivity and access issues, different formats and modes of delivery might be required for online classes and in order to support SDML. In essence, this aspect relates directly to the different aspects of SDML and the student needs thereby implied with individual multimodality.

Multimodality is also considered in the advice. Firstly, multimodality needs to be considered in terms of content. In this regard, in OAS1 the following is stated:  'Create  multiple  formats  for  learning  materials'  (UCT  2020).  Within OAS7, it is recommended that teachers '[b]e present and available in different modes during  regular  scheduled  class  time '  (UP  2020:3  [emphasis  in  the original]).  Furthermore,  in  OAS11  it  is  stated  that  '[t]he  use  of  multimedia ensures more efficient gains in knowledge and skills as information can be presented  using  combinations  of  several  different  media'  (Sandars  et  al. 2020). Some sources stated that there is no single solution for all contexts (OAS2)  and  that  the  multimodal  content,  such  as  photographs  or  video, should  relate  to  students'  experiences  (OAS11).  Furthermore,  the  use  of different appropriate tools is also advised (OAS12).

Secondly,  multimodality  is  also  regarded  within  the  context  of  online communication.  OAS8  also  refers  to  different  modes  as  it  is  noted  that students should be informed about the 'delivery modalities' and the 'modes of communication' (UJ 2020:1). It is also declared in OAS11 that '[i]t is important to ensure that the communication is two-way so that learners have diverse avenues to seek advice and guidance' (Sandars et al. 2020).

As  regards  face-to-face  mode  of  delivery  versus  an  online  mode,  it  is apparent that the amount of content needs to be reduced. So, it is suggested in  OAS6  to  keep  the  essence  of  a  lecture  and  that  '[i]nstructors  need  to identify a few specific things that they want their students to learn, and focus on  those'  (Gewin  2020:295-296).  It  is  also  suggested  that  the  class  size determines the nature of the online approach. For large classes, this might mean separating the class into smaller groups (OAS8, OAS11). Hence, within the context of SDML, the facets of the instructional multimodality need to be adapted to the needs of classes and individual students.

The type of communication in the learning sphere is also affected by the online  medium and approaching learning in an asynchronous manner. It is noted in OAS11 that in this context (Sandars et al. 2020):

There is a lack of nonverbal communication in asynchronous discussions, even with the use of Emojis ('smiley faces' and 'thumbs up' symbols), and this can lead to a lack of trust between the participants, with the inevitable reduced contribution to the discussion. (n.p.)

Consequently, despite the affordances provided by online contexts regarding the use of different mediums, there might be less semiotic resources available in terms of nonverbal communication.

Through the use of different modes of communication, engagement can be facilitated  with  and  between  students.  This  aspect  is  essential  in  terms  of supporting emotional and affective aspects of the learning process, especially in the COVID-19 and similar contexts where students may feel isolated or be affected by other aspects of their lives, which may impact negatively on their learning.

## Emotional and affective issues

Affective issues are particularly essential in terms of motivating students to learn. Specifically, within the context of this chapter, additional support might be  required.  Consequently,  not  only  should  the  students  be  supported  in terms of their emotional state (OAS1 and OAS10) but also should the teachers be supported to share their own emotions (OAS3 and OAS7) and personality (OAS4). Establishing that students and teachers are in this situation together is echoed in OAS10 as it is recommended that teachers '[b]e positive, be a host and let everyone know you are in this together' (Kapp 2020) and that they  maintain  what  OAS12  calls  the  'human  connection'  (Snelling  &amp;  Fingal 2020).

Teachers  should  consider  that  students  might  feel  isolated  and  should, therefore, maintain regular contact (OAS8 and OAS9). It is recommended that the emotional dimension, that is lost because of the absence of a physical presence,  be  compensated  through  descriptive  written  interactions.  OAS7 makes  this  suggestion:  'Include  the  use  of  emotions  while  you  write  to compensate  for  the  lack  of  facial  expressions  in  the  online  environment' (UP 2020:4).

In  OAS1,  the  following  is  posed  to  teachers:  'Be  kind  to  yourself  and empathic to your students' as well as 'Encourage an environment of caring and  support.  Be  flexible:  exceptions  may  need  to  occur  around  course requirements' (UCT 2020). In OAS7, it is stated that as 'students may feel isolated, it is essential to create a sense of community and care' (UP 2020:4). Hence, even through the multimodal learning environment, such a feeling of being a community and caring can be supported. A practical way to gauge emotional  issues  would  be  to  follow  this  recommendation  by  OAS1:  'Seek student feedback about their workload, emotional state, learning preferences, and learning pace' (UCT 2020).

These  issues  around  affective  variables  in  the  learning  context  and, specifically, motivation are highly relevant for successful SDML. In terms of SDL, Zhu et al. (2020) found that motivation affects SDL in terms of selfmonitoring and self-management. From the sources, an essential additional part of SDML, student agency, was also prominent.

## Student agency and flexibility

In this chapter, SDML is closely regarded within the concept and process of SDL. As SDL requires students taking charge for their own learning, this also implies some flexibility on the side of online courses. To this end some of the OASs prompt teachers to make recording rather than live stream videos to not  only  address  technical  access  challenges  but  also  allow  for  viewing students' own time and pace (OAS3, OAS4, OAS6, OAS7 and OAS8). OAS8 also suggests that teachers '[a]dopt a flexible approach to how you approach online teaching - things may not work as planned' (UJ 2020:1). Such flexibility can also provide affordances for students to approach their learning in a more personalised manner  through which the three aspects of SDL, selfmanagement, self-monitoring and motivation, could also be supported.

Interestingly, there was also clear evidence of support for SDL specifically in  the  advice  albeit  not  necessarily  named  SDL.  OAS7  notes  that  teachers should 'encourage students to prepare independently for each class' (UP 2020:1). In OAS6, it is highlighted that teachers 'set up their courses so that students can pursue self-paced enquiry - exploring the topic under their own initiative'  (Gewin 2020:296). Therefore, learning should be planned to allow students to learn not only at their own pace but also, importantly, on their own initiative. This emphasis on student initiative ties in with the definition of SDL by Knowles (1975), where individuals specifically take the initiative for their learning. Besides, initiative in learning is also one of the factors measured by means of the Self-Directed Learning Readiness Scale by Lucy M. Guglielmino (Brockett &amp; Hiemstra 2019).

It is furthermore advised that students take ownership of their learning. In OAS3, it is suggested that students take control and the following is noted: 'You can set up online group spaces for small groups of students and ask them to support and consult with one another before sending emails to you directly' and 'Encourage students to use the communication tools they prefer' (The Conversation 2020). Likewise, in OAS6 (Gewin 2020), it is stated that:

[ A ]sking students what they hope to get out of the online course, and how you can best serve them, offers instructors ideas for teaching and gives students ownership of the process. (p. 296)

Elements of supporting SDL were evident in the sources (OAS4 and OAS11) although with elements of reductionism. For example, in OAS4, the following

recommendation is made to teachers: 'Give your students trust and a little leeway and you'll be amazed by how hard they'll work to get their work done' (ACS 2020).  It  is  also  even  recommended  by  some  sources  that  teachers make use of students' expertise (OAS5, OAS10). Overall, these issues pertain to creating an environment and process that is student-centred. For OAS9, this implies an interaction between students and content, other students and teachers. On a more practical level, it is also encouraged that teachers be flexible in terms of deadlines and class attendance (OAS5) as well as the way assessments are completed. To this end, the use of handwritten assessments that can be photographed and then uploaded is even suggested (OAS8).

In OAS11, the following statement is made regarding SDL, and this supports the importance of student choice in terms of resources (Sandars et al. 2020):

Learners become self-directed, with increased motivation and engagement, since they can select online tutorials from a range of different online tutorials that meet their own learning goals at a time and place that fits in with their other demands. (n.p.)

This accentuates the importance of SDL in the SDML and, specifically, the transitioned  online  context  focused  on  in  this  chapter.  A  further  level  of student agency is students being involved in creating content. In OAS11, it is suggested that students are involved in co-creating content, and this supports even further student agency and a positive move towards SDML.

Another aspect noted in the data was that of assessment, and this should also be considered an indispensable element of the SDML process.

## Assessment

Limited information was included in the OASs regarding assessment. However, it was proposed that assessments be used as a way to gauge attendance and participation through automatically marked quizzes, for example, (OAS3) or determining who the students are and what challenges they might experience (OAS8).  In  OAS6,  the  following  is  remarked  'the  most  successful  virtual teachers conduct frequent assessments, and check in by phone, text or email with  each  student  -  most  often  with  those  who  are  struggling'  (Gewin 2020:296). Similarly, OAS7 also supports the idea that assessments prior to classes can be used to determine students' preparedness and inform what is done in class meetings.

It was also suggested that various types of assessments are implemented. In OAS8, it is stated that teachers should employ different assessment strategies and make use of the different tools on the learning management system. The following  examples  of  tools  are  also  specifically  mentioned:  'short  question

types,  voice  answers,  portfolios,  discussions,  journalling  [ sic ]  and  blogs'  (UJ 2020:2).

The issue of feedback was also raised in the sources. Feedback is described in OAS8 as critical and that '[c]onstructive feedback will enhance learning' (UJ  2020:3).  This  source  (UJ  2020:3)  provides  three  useful  and  practical recommendations:

- · Consider smaller assignments so that feedback is possible.
- · Develop a detailed rubric to simplify feedback.
- · Compile  a  list  of  standard,  constructive  feedback  remarks  that  can  be copied and pasted into assignments when marking.

Using  assessment  as  a  feedback  mechanism,  the  SDML  process  can  be informed, and this would also allow teachers to identify specific challenges experienced by students.

## Students with challenges or special needs

In a move to a multimodal environment, it is essential to consider additional requirements from all students and also students with special needs. According to OAS6, students who struggle should be identified and supported. Also, in OAS11,  it  is  recommended  that  analytics  from  the  learning  management system inform student support.

In OAS8, this aspect is worded as follows: 'Make provisions for your students who have challenges using technology' (UJ 2020:3), and some contact details for technical support is listed. However, the specific reference to special needs was not observed in any of the OASs, and this would be an area that would require further attention in this genre of advice texts.

Throughout the SDML process and specifically within the OASs, the role of the teacher cannot be ignored, despite the centrality of the student.

## The role of the teacher

Despite physical distancing between student, class and teacher through online learning, the focus can potentially still be increasingly student-centred. In this regard, it is essential to not completely ignore the role of the teacher in the process. The sources advise that teachers set clear and reasonable expectations and  specific  instructions  (OAS3,  OAS4,  OAS5,  OAS8  and  OAS11)  and  be available regularly (OAS7 and OAS9).

It is suggested by sources that teachers be available at set times (OAS5 and OAS7) and at least be available by email. In OAS8, it is even suggested that a set response timeframe is shared with students so that they know when

to expect a response. Teachers should also support students to be able to use the online environments used for classes (OAS11). These aspects provide, within  SDML,  a  framework  through  which  students  can  make  use  of  the teacher as a resource.

Teachers  beginning  part  of  the  learning  process  can  be  supportive  of successful SDML. It is suggested that online presentations and videos should not just include content but also include the teacher's face (OAS3, OAS10). This aspect not only supports the notion of a teacher's presence (Garrison 2017) but also supports of the empirical research confirming the advantages of including teachers' faces in videos (Kizilcec et al. 2015). In terms of including teachers' faces in this context, it is essential that they are positioned carefully as to not become a distraction.

## Discussion

From this data analysis, it is clear that the OASs covered many diverse aspects and that facets of SDML and elements conducive towards successful SDML were identified. However, they were reduced and diluted to an extent. From the SDML scorecard analysis, an apparent spread of both SDL and multimodal learning aspects was present in the OASs. However, creating a positive and comfortable  environment,  collaboration  and  embracing  different  modes  of communication and learning were the most prominent.

From the inductive analysis of the contents of OASs, the main themes focus on accessibility, following a no and low-tech approach, having clear structure and planning as well as promoting active learning. Furthermore, it was evident that  in  the  multimodal  environment,  a  social  presence  is  established  and maintained within the context of different formats and modes of interaction and instruction. The SDML process also required recognising emotional and affective issues in terms of students as well as supporting student agency and broader  flexibility  in  the  learning  process.  Finally,  certain  issues  around assessment, students with challenges or special needs as well as the key role of the teacher were raised.

An aspect that was lacking from the analysed OASs was opportunities for collaboration for critical engagement or inputs regarding the advice. Introne and Goggins (2019) have shown how collective community processes could be beneficial for effective online study advice. The different types of sources also had an impact on the generalisability of the advice. While most of the sources  consulted  were  not  intended  for  a  specific  institution,  they  were relatively  generic  and  applicable  for  different  contexts.  However,  in  some cases, such as OAS7, a lot of the information - although published publicly was specifically aimed at staff and students of the specific institution.

## Limitations

Certain limitations were evident from this research. This research is in no way exhaustive  in  covering  all  online  publicly  published  advice.  Hence,  it  is recognised  that  the  sampling  is  relatively  random  and  not  all-inclusive.  In addition, this chapter was limited to online study advice published in English. In a similar way as the research by Zaman et al. (2020), it is a drawback for this research that it is limited to public online study advice, and future studies could explore the private and institutional spheres in this regard. Also, in line with Zaman et al. (2020), extensions of this research could involve empirically testing some of the findings and probing actual understanding and practices based on the advice. Finally, out of the nature of the documents analysed for this research, it cannot be assumed that advice texts would necessarily be conceptualised to consider the aspects of SDML focused on in this chapter.

## Cogitation

This  research  was  prompted  by  the  fact  that,  at  the  start  of  worldwide lockdowns because of the COVID-19 pandemic, I observed repeated references on social media and elsewhere online to 'low-tech solutions', what seemed to be  advice  to  water  down  the  online  learning  experience  for  the  sake  of efficiency and access. This perception of online learning lite or drive-through instant  online  learning may  have  served  as  the  impetus  for  this  research. However,  through  the  analysis  of  the  identified  online  study  advice  texts, I journeyed with authors who were sharing years of experience or epiphanies from  sudden  immersions  in  online  learning.  In  a  quest  to  search  for  and measure degrees of SDML in the texts, I read the advice (asynchronously) together with thousands of teachers to find not only self-direction but also definite accommodations of various facets of multimodal learning imbedded in the advice. In reflection, it is essential, within the context of this research, to advise authors and their readers act critically and interrogate all aspects of advice peddled online.

## Conclusion

This study explored the online nature of SDML in online study advice while specifically  focusing  on  whether  such  guidelines  adhered  to  the  basic principles  associated  with  the  theoretical  foundations  around  multimodal learning and SDL. This qualitative research involved an analysis of such advice from a corpus of selected online texts and found that complex pedagogical concepts were reduced or diluted as was expected from a genre like OASs. This chapter determined that despite little overt reference to either SDL or multimodal learning, many principles and aspects acting in support of SDML

were identified in online study advice. As sources, like the OASs analysed in this  chapter,  are  published  online  and  may  have  a  great  impact,  it  is recommended from this research that academics working within SDML and related  fields  engage  further  with  this  type  of  communication  in  order  to inform more comprehensive educational practices in terms of completed and ongoing  research.  In  addition,  it  is  also  essential  for  teachers  who  might consume content like the OASs approach such sources in a critical manner in order to inform their practices sensibly.

solving, opportunities for collaboration and the specific resources available to students and facilitators. The qualitative study that this chapter is based on was completed from within a pragmatist paradigm and involved document analyses and multimodal content analyses to do an exploratory evaluation of the selected microworlds. The exploratory evaluation focused on the creation of a rubric for evaluation of the features of microworlds. Specific aspects in the selected microworlds were identified that can potentially support SDML.

## Introduction

In order to foster SDL in a learning situation, the environment - which is often multimodal in nature - needs to provide a supportive context. Self-directed learning is considered an approach or process by which learners take control of  their  own  learning  (Brockett  &amp;  Hiemstra  2019;  Francom  2010;  Gibbons 2002; Knowles 1975). It  is  not  a  new  concept  and  was  a  major  means  for learning  before  organised  formal  educational  institutions  were  established. The control exercised by learners can be seen at various levels, and different models place different emphases on the factors involved in the SDL process (Bosch, Mentz &amp; Goede 2019; Brockett &amp; Hiemstra 2019; Tredoux 2012). With regard to enabling environments for SDL, research has been done on learning management systems, amongst others (Tredoux 2012). This chapter specifically  focuses  on  constructionist  microworlds  as  supportive  environments for SDML. For the sake of consistency of sources, and to distinguish SDL as a separate phenomenon, both SDL and SDML are used in this chapter.

The areas of SDL, microworlds and multimodal learning are well researched in existing scholarship. This informed the literature review of this chapter. The rubric  for  evaluation  was  created  from  the  literature  on  supportive  environments for SDL. Literature on the design, efficacy, contexts and learning models of microworlds  guided  the  features  of  the  microworlds  that  were  evaluated. Finally, the rich multimodal nature of microworlds enabled us to create another lens to link the results. For the envisaged exploratory evaluation of the selected microworlds, we drew on the SDL guidelines proposed by Gibbons (2002) as well as the variables identified by Brockett and Hiemstra (2019).

## Problem statement and research questions

Central  to  this  research  is  probing  what  elements  found  in  the  selected microworlds would enable them to be supportive learning environments for SDML.  Therefore,  the  main  research  question  posed  for  this  exploratory evaluation was as follows:

- · What  features  of  microworlds  enable  them  to  be  supportive  learning environments for SDML?

The  subquestions  that  supported  the  main  research  question  were  as follows:

- 1. What design features of microworlds match the requirements of SDL?
- 2.  What aspects of multimodal learning are supported by microworlds?
- 3.  What  specific  features  of  the  microworlds  contribute  to  setting  up  and solving problems?
- 4.  What opportunities are there in microworlds to support collaboration?
- 5.  What resources are available to learners and facilitators for microworlds in the SDML context?

## Constructionism

This  research  is  built  on  constructionist  scholarship. Constructionism is considered a learning theory that was developed by Seymour Papert (cf. Noss  &amp;  Hoyles  2017,  2019)  which  builds  on  the  constructivism  of  Jean Piaget.  The  core  idea  of  constructionism  is  the  construction  of  a  public entity  in  a  context  that  is  meaningful  to  learners  (Noss  &amp;  Hoyles  2017; Papert 1980). The link between SDL and constructionism was also clearly established by Clinton and Rieber (2010) in the context of learner-centred studio-based education, as well as by Rojprasert, Neanchaleay and Boonlue (2013) within the context of constructionism with regard to new media in Thai HE.

The construction can be of any artefact, whether digital (like a computer program or artwork) or physical (models, instruments or objects), which is meaningful to the learner. The first implementation of constructionist ideas came in the form of LOGO - a programming language designed especially for  learning  in  the  1960s  and  1970s.  LOGO  enabled  learners  to  construct graphics based on simple commands. More than 300 implementations of constructionist ideas have since been made, though not all are under active development  as  of  2020  (The  Logo  Tree  Project  2020).  Such  learning applications that have a constructionist framework of learning have been termed microworlds (cf.  Girvan,  Wickham &amp; Tangney 2016; Noss &amp; Hoyles 2017, 2019).

## Microworlds

In this section, we look at literature around microworlds in the context of this study. Firstly, we look at how microworlds are defined as well as exploring aspects of multimodality inherent to them. Furthermore, the four microworlds that  form  the  sample  of  this  study  are  briefly  described.  Finally,  the  core design features of the microworlds and the support that they provide to the learners are considered.

## Microworlds as multimodal learning environments

Microworlds are specially designed learning environments that allow learners to explore ideas in a safe manner within a multimodal environment that may simulate real-life situations. The word safe is  used  in  this  context,  as  these environments allow learners to explore, implement and construct without any negative consequences detrimental to their learning. Papert (1987:80) defined a microworld as 'a simplified piece of reality which you can explore, and again there's no right or wrong'. Noss and Hoyles (2017:6) further described this concept  as  an  environment  that  acts  as  'a  concrete  embodiment  of  a knowledge domain or structure'.

Edwards  (1995)  provided  a  set  of  criteria  for  a  microworld  and  also discussed  the  inherently  embedded  nature  of  multiple  representations  in microworlds and their effect on the learning process. The idea of multiple representations closely relates to multimodality. In this chapter, multimodality (cf.  Bateman, Wildfeuer &amp; Hiippala 2017) is deemed as an essential part of learning with microworlds. Rieber (2004)  described  three  aspects  of representations involved in learning in microworlds: reduced cognitive load, clarifying the problem space and revealing immediate implications.

Since 2000, some implementations of microworlds have become exceedingly popular, and some are used by millions of learners worldwide. Some notable examples of software in this regard are Scratch 5  (Resnick et al. 2009),  Turtle  Blocks 6   (Bender  &amp;  Urrea  2015),  NetLogo 7   (Tisue  &amp;  Wilensky 2004;  Wilensky  1999)  and  GeoGebra 8   (Hohenwarter  &amp;  Fuchs  2005).  This chapter focuses on these examples of microworlds. We note that, except for GeoGebra, the other three applications are direct descendants of LOGO, with the lead developers of these associated with Seymour Papert: Walter Bender for Turtle Blocks, Uri Wilensky for NetLogo and Mitchel Resnick for Scratch. With  the  proliferation  of  the  Internet,  these  microworlds  now  have  online interfaces and fora through which learners can communicate and collaborate with peers and mentors across the world. This has also led to the creation of a large pool of learning resources, many of which are available as OERs. In light  of  this  background,  we  performed  an  exploratory  evaluation  of  the features of microworlds that enable learning environments that support SDML.

## Design features of microworlds

Microworlds are specifically designed for learning. They include features that help learners to experiment and explore various possibilities that the tools in microworlds  allow.  Broadly  speaking,  all  microworlds  share  some  common design features that are well summarised by the Scratch Design Goals (Scratch 2012): 'If Scratch was a room, it would have a low floor, wide walls, and a high ceiling'.

Though  the  above  quote  specifically  relates  to  Scratch,  these  design principles are applicable to other microworlds. One can even argue that these are  the  essential  features  of  an  application  to  be  called  a  microworld.  The room metaphor is apt to explain the context of learning:

- · Low floor: It typically relates to the entry point of these applications; they are easy, and little or no prerequisite knowledge is needed.
- · Wide walls: It refers to the scope of creating different types of artefacts with the applications to address various needs of learners.
- · High ceiling: It  refers  to  the  fact  that  the  applications  can  be  used  to make  complex  artefacts  as  well,  and  there  is  no  limit  to  what  can  be accomplished.  A  'turtle'  can  be  used  to  explore  complex  concepts  in physics and mathematics; see, for example, Turtle Geometry (Abelson &amp; DiSessa  1986).  Scratch  has  been  used  to  create  complex  animations, games and applications. GeoGebra has been used for exploring differential equations and calculus (Mhohen 2008). NetLogo is a modelling tool for researchers  working  on  complex  systems  (Tisue  &amp;  Wilensky  2004; Wilensky  &amp;  Rand  2015),  and  researchers  use  it  to  develop  models  of natural phenomena.

Other than these, tinkerability (i.e.  the  ability  to  tinker,  change  or  adapt) is another essential feature of constructionism and hence also of microworlds. Tinkering does not have a fixed definition, but it is seen as a playful style of exploring and experimenting. Resnick and Rosenbaum (2013) provide a good explanation of what tinkering entails:

We see tinkering  as  a  valid  and  valuable  style  of  working,  characterized  by  a playful, exploratory, iterative style of engaging with a problem or project. When people are tinkering, they are constantly trying out ideas, making adjustments and refinements, then experimenting with new possibilities, over and over and over. (p. 164)

In addition, Resnick and Rosenbaum (2013) also make the following pertinent statement:

We see tinkering as a style of making things, regardless of whether the things are physical  or  virtual.  You  can  tinker  when  you  are  programming  an  animation  or writing a story, not just when you are making something physical. The key issue is the style of interaction, not the media or materials being used. (p. 166)

A key implication of tinkerability is that it allows epistemological pluralism -that is, it allows for different styles of learning, knowing and expressing (Turkle &amp; Papert 1992). The idea of epistemological pluralism has particular significance for SDL, as it is a learner-centric feature that empowers learners with different backgrounds and approaches to make meaning. Tinkerability would thus be crucial in providing learner agency in the context of SDL, as learners play a central role in planning and managing their learning through this process.

The four microworlds are multimodal in nature and differ slightly in terms of some implementations and features. Turtle Blocks and Scratch are examples of visual programming languages (also called block programming languages ). In a visual programming language, instead of typing commands, visual blocks are combined (like LEGO® blocks) by drag and drop to create programs. Visual programming languages have several affordances for learners, which allow even novice learners to create programs with ease (e.g. see Repenning 2017).

GeoGebra is an interactive programmable graphical simulator for mathematical objects that allows learners to construct mathematical artefacts. GeoGebra is a dynamic mathematics application to combine geo metry and al gebra views and also has features of statistics (spreadsheets). GeoGebra is also a visual programming language (but not a block programming language) in the sense that learners do not have to write syntax in text format. Instead, they can use the tools visually to create mathematical objects. For example, to create an intersection point between two lines, an Intersection Tool is used at the point of intersection, or two objects to be intersected are selected.

The design considerations for NetLogo-like environments with a focus on visualisations of different types are discussed in detail in Kornhauser, Wilensky and  Rand  (2009).  NetLogo  provides  options  for  displaying  various  active agents and can display data of parameters in the model through numbers, graphs and colour-coded visual shapes which can change dynamically. These visual shapes, called agents and patches, can be programmed to behave and interact  according  to  the  requirements.  Although  NetLogo  is  a  text-based programming language (in this way it differs from the other three applications), the syntax is human readable - one can make sense of the commands by reading  them.  For  example,  the  command  'create-turtles  20'  would  create 20 turtles.

## Self-directed multimodal learning

In this section, we look at literature around SDL with a focus on multimodal learning. We define SDML and look at aspects of multimodality and multimodal learning relevant to the present study. Finally, we consider the principles of SDL-enabling environments that are reported from the literature.

## From self-directed learning to self-directed multimodal learning

As noted in the introduction, the focus in this chapter is on the fostering of SDL through the use of microworlds in the learning context. However, as such environments are inherently multimodal, it is also logical to extend the research to the concept of SDML. Where the literature specifically relates to SDL, the term  is  used  separately;  however,  for  the  purposes  of  this  chapter,  SDL  is regarded as being inclusive of SDML.

Self-directed  multimodal  learning  can  be  defined  as  a  pedagogical approach through which SDL is promoted within a context where individual modal  preferences  of  learners  are  recognised;  communication  is  done multimodally; and different modalities are employed in the blending of the learning, teaching and delivery processes (Olivier 2020a, 2020b). Four levels of multimodality are relevant for SDML: individual multimodality (relating to individual learner modal preferences), interactional multimodality (modes of communication), instructional multimodality (modes employed for learning) and  institutional  multimodality  (mode  of  delivery)  (Olivier  2020a,  2020b). When microworlds are used in the learning context, they are relevant in all four  stated  levels.  However,  in  this  chapter,  the  focus  is  specifically  on interactional and instructional multimodality.

## Multimodality and multimodal learning

As multimodality is central to the way learning is approached in this chapter, the theoretical basis of multimodality should also be considered. Multimodality is not only ubiquitous to electronic media but wider society is also inundated with different forms of communication (Bateman et al. 2017). In this process, the concept of a mode is highly relevant, as it refers to a resource that is used to create meaning and can include text, images, sounds, gestures and various moving  images  (Bateman  et  al.  2017).  In  the  context  of  this  chapter,  the medium (i.e. the vehicle through which communication takes place) would be a microworld and its interactive components. The meaning-making elements used in  microworlds  are semiotic  resources .  In  concrete  terms,  the  multimodality paradigm is highly relevant when learning is regarded as a communicative act.

As  multimodality  builds  on  semiotics  (i.e.  the  study  of  signs),  it  is  also relevant in this chapter to consider the different signs and meaning-making elements found in the identified microworlds. The social semiotic (Kress &amp; Van Leeuwen 2006) approach followed in this chapter draws on systemic functional linguistics of M.A.K. Halliday (cf. Unsworth 2008). This is highly relevant, as with the semiotic resources available in the microworlds, 'the structures of language have evolved (and continue to evolve) as a result of the meaning-

making functions they serve within the social system or culture in which they are used' (Unsworth 2008:1). In the context of this chapter, online 'texts' such as  microworlds  employ  aspects  of  different  semiotic  systems,  specifically language, and also graphical and programmable systems.

For  the  sake  of  any  analysis  of  a  multimodal  environment,  such  as  the microworlds identified for this research, certain elements must be considered. Firstly,  the  phenomenon  of  a canvas is  highly  relevant  and  this  refers  to (Bateman et al. 2017):

[ A ]nything where we can inscribe material regularities that may then be perceived and taken up in interpretation, regardless of whether actual, virtual (digital), simply produced, performed physically in time, or the result of a complex technological process. (p. 87)

Hence, microworlds might have a specific element that acts as a canvas on which communicative signs are imposed or placed. In addition, canvases can also contain many subcanvases which include some semiotic content.

## Microworlds as enabling environments for selfdirected learning

Self-directed  learning,  as  espoused  by  Knowles  (1975),  has  three  major components: the learner, the teacher and the study materials. The nature of dynamic interaction between these three components determines the extent of  the  supporting  environment  for  SDL.  Francom  (2010:33)  provided  four major prescriptive principles of enabling environments for SDL:

- 1. Match the level of SDL required in learning activities to student readiness.
- 2.    Progress from teacher to student direction of learning over time.
- 3.    Support  the  acquisition  of  subject  matter  knowledge  and  SDL  skills together.
- 4.    Have students practise SDL in the context of learning tasks.

We  drew  on  these  four  principles  to  construct  a  rubric  to  analyse  the microworlds we selected for this study. The features and design aspects of the selected  microworlds  were  evaluated  in  the  context  of  these  principles, supported with relevant examples.

## Methodology

We employed two approaches for the methodology: an exploratory evaluation and a multimodal content analysis. The exploratory evaluation centred on the creation of a rubric for evaluation of the features of the selected microworlds. The rubric was based on research already done on supporting environments for SDL. Secondly, the microworlds were analysed in terms of multimodality

(Bateman  et  al.  2017;  Bezemer  &amp;  Kress  2016)  and  multimodal  learning (Olivier 2020a, 2020b) in general.

## Research paradigm and design

This exploratory study was done within the pragmatist paradigm (Cohen, Manion &amp; Morrison 2011:23), as the focus was on 'what works' and a practice-driven approach in which the research 'adopts a methodologically eclectic, pluralist approach to research, drawing on positivism and interpretive epistemologies based on the criteria of fitness for purpose and applicability'. As regards the evaluation of the selected microworlds, this research drew on methods related to document analysis (Cohen et al. 2011) as well as content analysis from the perspective of multimodal research (Bateman et al. 2017).

## Sampling and data collection

Environments  identified  for  this  research  were  selected  by  means  of  nonprobability  sampling  and  purposive  sampling  (Cohen  et  al.  2011).  Data collection involved written reflections made while using the identified software and screenshots. Written permission was obtained to include the screenshots in this chapter.

We have chosen four popular microworlds for this study: Scratch (ver. 3.17.1), Turtle Blocks (ver. 2.72), NetLogo (ver. 6.1.1) and GeoGebra (Classic ver. 6). These four microworlds fulfilled the following criteria:

- 1. Large user base: typically, thousands to millions.
- 2.    Both online (browser-based) and offline (stand-alone) versions.
- 3.    Platform independent: work on all major operating systems (GNU/Linux, Windows, Mac OSX and Android/iOS).
- 4.    Main interface is available in several languages: GeoGebra (70+ languages), Scratch (60+ languages), NetLogo (45+ languages) and Turtle Blocks (10+ languages).
- 5.    Active online fora rich in OERs: all the online versions of the applications include a repository of user-generated programs and discussion space and allow  user-generated  content  to  be  licensed  under  Creative  Commons licenses.
- 6.    Released with free software licenses:
- o GeoGebra:  GeoGebra  license  (source  code  is  licensed  under  GNU General Public License [GPL], but commercial use is prohibited from ver. 4.2 of release).
- o Scratch: Berkeley Software Distribution ver. 3.
- o NetLogo: GNU GPL ver. 2.0.
- o Turtle Blocks: GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL) ver. 3.

- 7. Actively under-development as of 2020. Public repositories of the projects for development show the activity status of the applications:
- o GeoGebra: https:/ /github.com/geogebra/geogebra
- o Scratch: https:/ /github.com/LLK/scratch-gui
- o NetLogo: https:/ /github.com/NetLogo/
- o Turtle Blocks: https:/ /github.com/sugarlabs/turtleblocksjs
- 8.    Actively  researched for pedagogical aspects: numerous educational and research studies have been conducted involving these applications.

## Data analysis

Bateman et al. (2017:218) suggested approaching any multimodal content as being sliced into 'canvases', which allows the analysis of different aspects of software  in  this  case.  This  allows  for  inductive  qualitative  analysis  of  the identified  environments, and we could then gauge whether these environments, as microworlds, were supportive for SDML. In this exploratory evaluation, the research also drew on the methods of existing research done on microworlds: for example, the work of Noss and Hoyles (2019:8-10) on ScratchMaths, and Tsur and Rusk (2018) using Scratch.

## Results

The results were derived from the exploration of the selected microworlds, using  a  rubric  containing  principles  of  SDL-enabling  environments.  The evaluation explored the feasibility of using these microworlds as supporting environments  in  the  SDL  context.  The  second  aspect  explored  was  the multimodal nature of the environment and to what degree this was supportive of multimodality and SDML.

## Rubric for the evaluation of a self-directed learning-enabling environment

The  literature  presents  four  basic  principles  that  are  needed  to  foster  an enabling environment for SDL. Below, each of these principles is expanded upon  in  light  of  the  features  of  microworlds,  and  relevant  examples  are provided in each instance.

## Matching the readiness of learners

All microworlds considered here offer a wide spectrum of possibilities, from very basic to very complex activities. The used cases of these applications

ranged from primary school to university level and were very flexible in their implementation, catering to specific requirements and abilities of learners.

## Low threshold for learners who are novices

All  four  microworlds  that  were  considered  had  a  low  threshold  for  novice learners as a design feature. Learners could therefore begin with some of the basic tools to create objects and did not need any prior experience in using the applications. In the case of NetLogo, there was a default ready-to-use preexisting  library  of  models.  In  the  other  three  applications,  no  default  preexisting model library exists, and such model files have to be downloaded.

In  the  following,  the  basic  user  experience  of  the  various  programs  is described.

GeoGebra : Opens a blank canvas, with basic tools at the top (Figure 4.1). The visible tools can be customised to meet the requirements of learners. For example,  advanced  tools  can  be  hidden  from  the  view  of  inexperienced learners. Also, the spreadsheet view, algebra view or the geometry view can be hidden as required by the learning context, and such views can be saved.

Note  the  position  of  the  tools  at  the  top,  algebra  view  is  on  the  left, geometry view is the part with the grid and there is a text input box at the bottom. New objects can be created on the canvas by clicking on the tools and then clicking on the canvas.

NetLogo :  Opens  a  blank  canvas  and  has  an  extensive  inbuilt  library  of readymade curricular models (Figure 4.2). These models can be loaded and explored by learners. There is no need to start the programming right away to use the application.

Note the control buttons at the top and command centre at the bottom which accepts text commands. To create new objects, one must go to the 'Code' tab and type commands or type commands in the command centre.

Scratch : Opens a blank canvas with tools (Figure 4.3). The basic tools are present. Learners can load pre-saved files or can start programming with the blocks. Note the blocks in the left panel and their colour-coded classification.

The blocks in the left panel can be dragged and dropped in the middle panel. Clicking on the blocks in the middle panel executes them. The result of the execution is seen on the right-hand side in the screen with the cat (a 'sprite').

Turtle Blocks : Turtle Blocks opens a default program with blocks for drawing a square (Figure 4.4). The basic tools are present. Learners can load pre-saved files or can start programming with the blocks. Additional blocks are available in the left panel. There is no separate canvas for results; the turtle and the programming blocks share the same space.

## Comparing the various microworlds

From a novice  perspective,  Turtle  Blocks  presents  the  easiest  entry  point, followed  by  Scratch  and  GeoGebra,  while  NetLogo  might  be  the  most challenging because it involves textual syntax. Simple applications that can be used  by  primary  school  learners  can  be  developed  in  both  Scratch  and GeoGebra.  Turtle  Blocks  was  also  part  of  the  software  stack  (SugarLabs) developed  for  the  One  Laptop  Per  Child  project 9   and  has  been  deployed mostly in primary and secondary schools.

There are two ways of addressing the issue of matching the readiness of learners  in  microworlds.  One  way  is  to  open  a  pre-designed  file  to  meet learning  requirements,  and  the  other  way  is  to  start  learning  on  the  blank canvas itself.  Both  approaches can be used with different levels of learner readiness. As an example of the former approach, interactive books that have specific learning objectives, including assessments,  can  be  created  in GeoGebra; the second approach may entail learning tasks that require learners to create and save their own files.

## High or no ceiling for advanced learners

While  microworlds  can  be  tuned  to  the  requirements  of  novice  and  young learners, the same tools can be used to create complex programs. This option is  used to create the cardioid curve (a heart shaped curve, as shown in Figure 4.5) which  results  after  reflection  from  a  circular  shape.  Note  the  different mathematical objects present in the algebra view in the left-hand panel.

GeoGebra : Features like sliders, trace path (Figure 4.5), logical operations, value checker and conditional programming and scripting options can create visual proofs, art forms, dynamic simulations and interactive books from basic and  advanced  concepts  in  mathematics.  Similarly,  it  is  possible  to  create

problems and games based on providing correct solutions, as assessments in various forms can be embedded in the simulations.

NetLogo : Most of the models in the NetLogo library are curricular models (e.g.  gas-law  models)  that  present  a  complex-systems  approach  to  these models. These curricular models require a user to understand a few complex requisite concepts. Although substantial background information to explore and understand the model is given on the 'Info' page, learners should have some prerequisite knowledge of the basic concepts. The NetLogo simulations allow learners to explore the models by varying the parameters and studying their results. NetLogo 10  is also used by complex systems researchers to create models of various natural phenomena (Figure 4.6).

Scratch :  Scratch allows learners to create many complex games (Figure 4.7), animations and applications that can use the variety of available editing and multimedia  options.  Learners  can  create  their  own  'sprites'  and  sounds. Scratch can also be used with external electronics and sensors such as Arduino and  Raspberry  Pi,  thus  opening  up  immense  possibilities  of  design  and construction.

Turtle Blocks :  Turtle Blocks has advanced options such as logical operations, music (Figure 4.8) and external sensors that can be used to create complex programs.  Turtle  Blocks  can  also  be  used  in  conjunction  with  external electronics and sensors such as LEGO Mindstorms, 3D printers, Raspberry Pi and Arduino.

Starting from very basic,  learners  can  advance  to  very  complex  constructions involving rich learning experiences, involving both conceptual knowledge and computational thinking. The concrete objects of the programs - such as lines and points, turtles, patches and sprites - on which learners operate provide 'objects to think with' for both computational and conceptual thinking and for providing  a  link  between  sensory  and  abstract  knowledge  (Papert  1980). Such concrete objects, the 'objects to think with', whose behaviour can be

modified and explored, are at the core of constructionist learning, and they also provide a link between the individual and social world. Thus, we see that, in the case of all four microworlds, the learning context can be fine-tuned to the  requirement or level  of  learners,  which  is  the  first  criterion  of  an  SDLenabling environment.

## Progress from teacher to learner direction

The second criterion for enabling SDL relates to progress from teacher to learner  direction,  as  learners  should  take  charge  of  the  learning  process (Knowles 1975). This concept ties in with what Brockett and Hiemstra (2019) describe as personal responsibility or the fact that learners assume ownership of the learning process. Furthermore, in the context of microworlds, enabling SDL  can  be  realised  by  giving  learners  autonomy  in  selecting  their  own projects and increasing their agency in the goals and execution of the project. The teacher plays the role of a mentor in helping learners achieve their goals for the project independently or collaboratively. This is the approach suggested by  constructionism  as  well.  This  aspect  ties  in  with  previous  literature specifically showing the affordances of constructionism in SDL in a multimodal context (Rojprasert et al. 2013). According to the constructionist approach, learning would best happen when the project is personally relevant to the learner, and the artefact is a public entity where constructionism (Papert &amp; Harel 1991):

[ S ]hares constructivism's connotation of learning as 'building knowledge structures' irrespective of the circumstances of the learning. It then adds the idea that this happens  especially  felicitously  in  a  context  where  the  learner  is  consciously engaged in constructing a public entity, whether it's a sand castle on the beach or a theory of the universe. (p. 1)

Thus, constructionism resonates with the idea of a learner-centric approach instead of a teacher-centric one. By adding the aspects of personal relevance in its wake, the role of the learner becomes important in the process.

Enabling learners to create their own projects : All four microworlds enable learners to explore the creation of their projects while at the same time also allowing  exploring  pre-existing  projects.  The  projects  can  be  curricular  or non-curricular and can have open-ended goals. Also, the existing projects can be saved locally to create a copy of the project, thus allowing learners to reuse the existing code. Therefore, the process by which learners select the projects should  be  carefully  attended  to  and  depends  on  the  way  microworlds  are implemented in the classroom. When used in a strictly instructionist manner, even a microworld can lead to a very teacher-centric mode, thus not enabling SDL. The degree of freedom given to learners to select and execute their own projects  would  be  an  indicator  for  both  SDL  and  constructionist  learning.

This  aspect  of  SDL-enabling  depends  crucially  on  how  microworlds  are implemented.

## Support the acquisition of subject matter knowledge

The four microworlds have different ways of supporting learners' acquisition of  subject  matter  knowledge.  In  this  regard,  Turtle  Blocks,  Scratch  and GeoGebra are different  from  NetLogo.  Activities  that  make  use  of  subject matter  knowledge  from  other  sources,  like  classroom  discussions  and textbooks, can be designed to be carried out by students.

## Available help

With the online modes available in the current versions of all microworlds considered here, we can categorise the help available in online and offline modes. Online help is typically what learners would get when they post their work or issues on online fora where other learners can view and comment on the submitted work. Such help is not available to learners if they do not have Internet access. Online fora can also provide help through available tutorials, user manuals or looking at already existing projects, posting problems and issues  on  fora.  Thus,  online  help  can  be  rendered  in  both  synchronous and  asynchronous  modes.  Offline  help  typically  includes  the  help  that  is bundled with the applications, such as user manuals, tool tips and examples with basic use. Such help can be accessed without using the Internet.

## Inbuilt help: Technical

GeoGebra : No inbuilt help is available in the form of a user manual or tutorials. The sections in the 'Help' menu go to the online user manual and tutorials. Technical  help  is  available  in  the  form  of  tooltips  which  appear  when  the cursor is on the tools (Figure 4.9). The tooltip help in GeoGebra is in the form of a short text indicating the way the tool can be used. In this figure, the 'Point Tool' is selected, and the tooltip help indicates that the user needs to select (click on) a position (in the grid) or another mathematical object like a line, function  or  curve.  Doing  this  would  create  a  point  on  the  plane  or  on  the mathematical object.

The  'Construction  Protocol'  of  the  cardioid  example  in  Figure  4.5  is presented in Figure 4.10. This protocol provides a step-by-step sequence of how the file was created, indicating the type of object and associated actions. When a file is opened in GeoGebra, the user can also access the 'Construction Protocol' (Figure 4.10). This is a history of how the constructions in the file were done and is a helpful feature  when  the  user  is  trying  to  learn  about constructions using GeoGebra.

NetLogo : The user manual is available locally in the form of browser-based web pages and can be accessed from menu Help &gt; NetLogo user manual (Figure 4.11). The user manual contains information on how to use NetLogo as well as tutorials explaining the commands. For easy referencing, there is also a 'Dictionary' for all command syntax.

Also, for each of the programs in the models library, the source code is available via the 'Code' tab (Figure 4.12); this allows users to explore the model by changing the program and seeing the results. The 'Code' tab shows the code used for creating the model. Figure 4.12 shows the code for the DLA model shown in Figure 4.6 (Wilensky 1997).

Scratch : There are several simple tutorial programs (Figure 4.13) available under the Tutorials tab. These tutorials use short animated GIFs (Figure 4.14) to teach how various blocks are used and are easy to follow. The tutorials use a sequence of short animated GIFs (typically for a few seconds) instead of long videos and do not have a voice-over. A given animated GIF only explains one short action, which might be helpful for novice learners.

Turtle  Blocks :  In  the  case  of  Turtle  Blocks,  only  basic  help  (Figure  4.15) about the interface is available in offline mode. There is no inbuilt help available for using the blocks. The user manual with description of the blocks is available online.

## Inbuilt help: Pedagogical

GeoGebra :  GeoGebra does not have any inbuilt pedagogical help with the application. One can think of GeoGebra as a geometrical construction box which allows users to construct a variety of mathematical artefacts.

NetLogo : NetLogo  models  explain  a  great  deal  about  the  model, including basic notions and interesting notes on the model, in the 'Info' tab (Figure 4.16).

Scratch  and  Turtle  Blocks : Scratch  and  Turtle  Blocks  do  not  have 'pedagogical' content but can be used to express a variety of imaginations, topics and themes. The presence of media in various forms - such as graphics, audio and text - makes them versatile tools suited for such explorations and expressions.

## Online resources: Open educational resources

GeoGebra : The online repository 13  has over a million classroom materials and tutorials licensed under Creative Commons by SA-NC Ver. 3.0 and above. The

resources  include  interactive  simulations,  visual  proofs,  visualisations  of mathematical constructions, books and assessments which are tagged with topics and grades.

NetLogo : The models in the NetLogo models library are available online 14 and are searchable. The online platform also has sections to discuss the model and look at the source code, version control and derivatives of the model. All the  models  are  released  with  Creative  Commons  licenses  (although  the specific license terms for a given model can vary).

Scratch : The online repository of Scratch 15  has user-generated content that is available under Creative Commons by SA Ver. 2.0 license. The projects are classified into different categories depending on the type of project.

Turtle  Blocks : Turtle  Blocks  has  a  'Global'  option  in  the  interface  where users  can  share  their  content  to  the  worldwide  community.  The  files  are arranged  according  to  categories.  The  license  term  is  not  explicit  and  is assumed to be AGPL.

All the online resources can be played online or downloaded for local use. Thus, we see that, in all four microworlds, there are rich online resources in the form of OERs that can be utilised by learners as needed. The presence of such resources potentially allows learners to set the goals for their own learning and would thus enable SDL.

## Online support groups

Active fora are associated with the microworlds for discussing technical and pedagogical difficulties. Earlier, support was in the form of mailing lists (which still exist), but now online fora are more active in this regard.

also has several topics pertaining to NetLogo. Other than this, the Modelling Commons 19  website is another forum for discussions of the models.

Turtle Blocks : The online help forum is in the form of a wiki. 20  It is, however, not as actively maintained as the other three applications.

Apart from these fora, for all the applications, GitHub repositories can be used  to  submit  bugs  and  new  features  to  the  programs.  Thus,  there  are multiple platforms  and  modalities  in  which  learners  are  supported  in microworlds.

## Multimodal aspects of learning with microworlds

This section involves an analysis of the four microworlds as multimodal texts by means of metalanguage of multimodality (Bateman et al. 2017; Bezemer &amp; Kress 2016; Kress &amp; Van Leeuwen 2006). Some specific elements for each of the microworlds are highlighted, after which some general observations are discussed.

## GeoGebra

GeoGebra is the least multimodal environment of the four. However, it still has elements of multimodality built in. In this regard, it involves a canvas with two subcanvases. However, additional canvases or frames (Bezemer &amp; Kress 2016) can be prompted by the user in order to use certain tools and then set specific variables.

As with NetLogo, GeoGebra to an extent relies on the user having some mathematical knowledge, as the environment relies heavily on subject-specific semiotic affordances in GeoGebra (Bezemer &amp; Kress 2016). This environment is also fairly interactive and changes can be instituted by the user. Because of the specific mathematical restrictions, this microworld is also highly scripted (Bateman et al. 2017).

Unlike the other three microworlds, position is a very important semiotic resource or mode (Bezemer &amp; Kress 2016). Within the mathematical context, positioning is actually a focus, as it has specific communicative and semantic value.

Just as with the input of different media formats, the microworlds support the creation of varied media artefacts as output. Some of the major formats are  visual,  auditory,  verbal  and  algebraic  (equations).  Visual  formats  may include  shapes,  colours,  animations,  movements,  line  drawings  and  graphs with interactive elements embedded. Options to export the active screen or output in various formats exist in all microworlds. Some of the major output formats  include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  visual  (JPG,  PNG,  SVG,  PDF,  EPS), verbal, videos/animations (animated GIFs), code (text, code blocks, LaTeX, nlogo), data (in form of text, tables, spreadsheets), audio (music and sound effects),  Cartesian  graphs  (with  data),  drawing  files  for  plotters  and/or  3D printers, and control for external electronics and displays. Thus, in both input and  output,  the  microworlds  are  rich  in  different  modalities  that  they  can produce and process and thus can cater to different learning styles.

## NetLogo

NetLogo also has elements of multimodality; however, it can be considered less interactive. As the emphasis is more on the user modifying existing values and conditions rather than creating syntax, this environment can be considered

even more highly scripted (Bateman et al. 2017) than the first two environments, unless users are capable of editing the NetLogo Code.

This  environment  also  involves  a  canvas  with  different  subcanvases, depending  on  the  selection  made  in  the  models  library.  It  is  evident  that NetLogo draws from an extensive set of semiotic affordances (Bezemer &amp; Kress  2016).  However,  users  must  be  informed  about  the  social  semiotic conventions of the different disciplines and topics realised through simulations. The information provided under 'Model Info' does provide some instructions and background.

The emphasis here is on users engaging with entering information changing the circumstances shown in the simulations; consequently, the complementary function (Bezemer &amp; Kress 2016) of user input is more prominent. The changes instigated by the user can also result in a transformative or semiotic change (Bezemer &amp; Kress 2016). However, at one level, syntax is less important in this environment, as that has been scripted, and the user is passively involved in intra-modal transformation of what is provided in the main subcanvas.

## Scratch

Scratch  shows  various  elements  of  multimodality  and  has  already  been analysed within this context (Birchfield et al. 2008). According to Birchfield et al.  (2008:5), 'Scratch incorporates multimodality through the integration of sound player modules within the primarily visual environment'. The analysis that follows was based on the various aspects of multimodality relevant to the identified canvases within the Scratch environment.

The Scratch environment utilises multiple canvases or frames (Bezemer &amp; Kress 2016) through which meaning is conveyed. The three main canvases comprise  a  code  list,  programming  and  preview  canvas.  As  a  multimodal environment, Scratch relies heavily on visual and syntactical grammar. It is also quite significant that this environment supports a number of languages, as the instructions depend a lot on the semantic values of the words listed throughout the environment.

On the left, under the heading 'Code', various text-based commands and properties semiotic resources in this context - are listed in what we call the code list canvas .  This provides the meaning potential and grammar for this microworld. This canvas is highly multimodal, as this section includes elements that  convey  meaning  through  colour,  text  and  shape.  To  this  end,  various colours indicate whether a semiotic resource relates to motion, looks, sound, events, control, sensing or acting as an operator or variable. There are also customisable semiotic resources that can be defined under 'My Blocks' as well as creation of user 'sprites' and sounds.

This microworld can be considered moderately scripted (Bateman et al. 2017), and the elements in the first canvas provide the syntax for the user of this  microworld.  Yet,  the  user  is  in  control  of  how  the  syntax  is  utilised. This canvas is essential to the SDML process, as through the range of elements available  on  this  canvas,  there  is  a  wide  resource  potential  available  for learners. It is a key element of SDL for learners to be able to select resources as they need them (Knowles 1975).

The canvas in the centre of the screen (the programming canvas ) allows for semiotic resources to be combined in order to form computer programs. Here, the  way  in  which  semiotic  resources  are  grouped  and  ordered  are  of importance. On this canvas, students can take charge and make use of the provided  resources  in  order  to  create  new  meaning.  Through  the  use  of variables within the semiotic resources, which could include typed words and numbers, various properties and actions are highly customisable, allowing for interactivity.  In  this  canvas,  the  image-text  relation  (Kress  &amp;  Van  Leeuwen 2006) is quite important as the shape contributes to meaning in a general sense,  but  in  many  cases,  the  text  elaborates,  qualifies  and  specialises  the property or action, for example.

The preview canvas displays a realisation of the commands and inserted canvas elements through the use of different sprites or pictures that can be animated through this process. In a sense, the elements placed on the programming canvas act in a performative manner to lead to action within the  preview  canvas.  The  preview  canvas  can  also  be  customised  through different  backgrounds,  which  can  contribute  towards  communicating  a specific context for the communicative acts performed here.

The  code  list  canvas  can  be  considered  as  being  fairly  non-interactive, while  the  programming  canvas  is  highly  interactive  (Bateman  et  al.  2017) through direct user intervention. However, the preview canvas is quite unique as  it  is  non-interactive  but  still  active  through  action  on  the  programming canvas by providing immediate feedback, which leads to instructions on the programming canvas being previewed here.

## Turtle Blocks

Like Scratch, the Turtle Blocks environment also shows various elements of multimodality  and  uses  a  programming  syntax  that  also  involves  shapes, colours  and  words  to  convey  meaning.  Scratch  is  different  in  that  this environment  basically  only  has  one  canvas  through  which  users  can  both provide input and see the output in the same area. However, this process from input to output also involves a form of transduction (Bezemer &amp; Kress 2016), as the verbal as well as graphical program is acted out through movement. Hence, meaning is changed from one mode to another.

To  program  in  Turtle  Blocks,  the  user  needs  to  select,  order  and  place programming semiotic resources or modes in an ensemble (Bezemer &amp; Kress 2016) in order for the program to work. An interesting feature is the fact that variables  are  graphically  plugged  into  certain  commands.  Hence,  semantic relationships  between  various  parts  are  established  visually.  Consequently, phrases are formed through shapes. Another example would be the Repeat loop, which has roughly the shape of a 'C' and encapsulates all the commands to be repeated within the two arms. So, there is less evidence of punctuation and rather framing (Bezemer &amp; Kress 2016) between and inside elements. There is also evidence of this environment being highly scripted (Bateman et al. 2017), with the user having a lot of control over how the syntax is structured.

As with any communicative act, using Turtle Blocks also entails a process of encoding,  transmission  and  decoding  which  is  realised  through  actions performed by the turtle avatar placed in the centre of the screen. In terms of spatial arrangement as mode (Bezemer &amp; Kress 2016), various menu elements are  placed  around  the  main  canvas.  Apart  from  the  menu  on  the  left  that includes some text, the rest of the menu elements are exclusively graphical. Generally, these icons are reliant on users' knowledge of the meaning of the icons. This property emphasises the social aspect of interactional multimodality in  this  environment.  So,  through  building  on  existing  semiotic  affordances (Bezemer &amp; Kress 2016), these icons draw on existing practices and reinforce and extend their use.

## Microworlds as multimodal texts for self-directed multimodal learning

From the analysis, various elements of multimodality could be discerned from the  microworlds.  Varying  degrees  of  interactivity  and  user  involvement  is possible. However, both verbal and graphical semiotic resources and modes are  utilised  throughout.  The  socially  mediated  communicative  aspect  does come through quite prominently, as users might have to be informed about the  social  conventions  and  knowledge  related  to  a  particular  discipline  in order  to  effectively  use  the  environments.  This  pre-knowledge  would  also influence successful SDML. In addition, the different microworlds form unique semiotic  landscapes  (Kress  &amp;  Van  Leeuwen  2006)  that  can  be  utilised  by teachers for SDML.

As different elements in the analysed microworlds contain semiotic modes, they  fulfil  the  three  metafunctions:  ideational,  interpersonal  and  textual (cf. Kress &amp; Van Leeuwen 2006). On an ideational level, there are elements of representation of the world around us and even personal experience, as users are involved in the creation of the text presented on the screen. Key to the ideational level is the logical function, as logical and semantic relationships

are  visualised  and  constructed  in  all  four  microworlds.  At  an  interpersonal level, the  environment  itself  does  not  necessarily  relate  to  any  social interactions;  however,  as  was  noted  earlier,  in  regard  to  interaction  and learning,  these  microworlds  have  separate  vibrant  user  communities  that attend  to  this  aspect.  The  textual  function  is  quite  prominent  in  all  four microworlds,  as  they  all  form  coherent  wholes.  As  such,  the  individual microworlds have context-specific rules and syntaxes that adhere to the social rules  set  by  the  creators  and  even  the  communities  of  the  microworlds. Through  transduction  (Kress  &amp;  Van  Leeuwen  2006),  users  can  plan  and prepare certain actions in one model (perhaps verbal, or visual combined with verbal),  while  in  another  canvas  or  subcanvas,  the  actions  are  displayed visually.

To utilise these, microworlds for SDML would require teachers and learners to understand the communicative aspects relevant to these multimodal texts. Consequently, the learning process would also involve some form of support towards visual literacy relevant to these contexts.

## Findings and recommendations

In the last two sections, we have seen different design features of the selected microworlds as well as the pedagogical and technical support that is available to learners. In this section, we discuss these features in the context of the research questions.

## Self-directed learning and microworlds

The first research subquestion, pertaining to SDL support, enquired about the design features that match the requirements for a supporting environment for SDL. The metaphor of a room with a low floor, high ceiling and wide walls perfectly encapsulates one of the requirements for an SDL-enabling environment - that of matching the readiness level of the learner. We have seen that, from very basic applications, microworlds can be used to construct complex projects. Thus, depending on where the learner is, a microworld can be used to match learners' abilities.

The  second  principle  of  progress  towards  a  learner-directed  approach depends  on  the  implementation  of  microworlds  with  learners.  While  the constructionist paradigm calls for public projects that are personally relevant to  learners,  all  the  implementations  may  not  deploy  it  in  this  manner. Microworlds can be used in a very regimented manner without any autonomy for learners. In such cases, even if microworlds are used, they would not enable SDL  or  entail  constructionist  learning.  The  change  of  the  role  of  teachers from  traditional  knowledge  givers  to  enablers  can  be  quite  challenging.

When projects and their goals are selected by learners, and teachers play the role of facilitators in completion of the projects, microworlds can potentially provide a good environment for enabling SDL.

Numerous learning resources and support mechanisms are available for all four microworlds, as can be seen from our limited survey. Learning resources available  as  OERs  make  their  distribution,  use  and  adaptation  easy.  Both inbuilt and online help for programming and pedagogical issues are exhaustive and online fora can help resolve any new challenges that learners face. The microworlds  have  well-established  support  mechanisms  for  acquisition  of knowledge by learners on their own, thus actualising the third principle of enabling SDL.

Finally, the fourth principle relates to students practising SDL within the context of performing learning tasks. The idea of learner autonomy is also relevant  to  this  principle,  which,  in  turn,  implies  the  way  microworlds  are implemented.  Microworlds  present  several  avenues  where  learners  can practise SDL in the context of learning tasks. In this regard, the feature of tinkerability of microworlds discussed earlier is highly relevant. Tinkerability of microworlds allows learners to explore and experiment on their own. Learners can also choose to tinker already existing projects to explore and experiment, a feature that is present in all four selected microworlds. As such, the process of tinkering is self-directed, and the spirit of tinkering would be lost if teachers directed  it  externally.  Another  germane  concept  is  that  of  epistemological pluralism in the context of microworlds. By allowing different approaches to learning tasks via tinkering and complementing different learning styles, the enabling of epistemological pluralism puts the learner in focus. Epistemological pluralism is also relevant for the first principle relating to matching learner readiness.  Learners  can  also  practise  SDL  by  participating  in  online  fora, posting questions and solving problems. Such an activity can be personally rewarding and is self-directed aligned with the interests of each learner.

Thus, overall, microworlds, if implemented with a learner-centric approach, can potentially provide an SDL-enabling environment.

## Multimodal learning and microworlds

At the start of this research, the following research question was posed: What aspects  of  multimodal  learning  are  supported  by  microworlds?  The  wider affordances  of  multimodal  learning  were  considered,  as  the  focus  of  this research was not only on SDL but also how it is realised through SDML.

It is clear that the analysed microworlds are highly appropriate resources to use within a context of individual multimodality (Olivier 2020a, 2020b). In this regard, at this level, students draw on their personal modal preferences to support their learning. The varied forms of input and output from microworlds

support  this,  despite  an  overemphasis  on  nonverbal  and  visual  features. However, the multimodal nature of these environments would be supportive to learning, especially as regards the transfer of sensory modalities.

Furthermore,  at  the  level  of  interactional  multimodality  (Olivier  2020a, 2020b),  microworlds  highlight  effective  multimodal  communication.  The verbal and visual semiotic resources utilised in microworlds allow for unique semantic potential, but in some cases, users should first acquire the syntax of each environment in order to effectively function and ultimately learn through the  aid  of  microworlds.  The  highly  customisable  nature  of  multimodal interactions in microworlds is supportive towards SDL and ultimately SDML.

All  microworlds  can  also  potentially  be  used  within  an  instructional multimodality  context  as  part  of  online  or  even  blended  face-to-face  and online learning experiences. The nature of microworlds would allow for both teacherand  peer-supported  or  more  independent  learning  activities. Depending on the strategies employed by teachers, microworlds can at an instructional multimodality level be employed to foster SDL.

## Problem-solving and microworlds

Microworlds enable learners to set up and solve problems in diverse ways. In most cases,  there  are  multiple  ways  in  which  a  particular  problem  can  be solved. There is no 'right' or 'wrong' solution (Figure 4.17), and this is precisely the meaning of a 'safe space' in the definition of a microworld. Such a 'safe space' implies diverse ways of learning, which, in turn, leads to the idea of epistemological pluralism.

Both program blocks produce the same output. Closely associated with this is the feature of tinkerability of microworlds. Having such a feature enables learners to discover novel solutions to problems on their own, thus creating ' Aha!'  moments. Finally, microworlds present learners with 'objects to think with' which help in posing and solving problems. 'Objects to think with' allow externalisation  of  memory  and  reduce  cognitive  load  of  learners.  In  such cases, learners can concretise abstract problems and clarify them in a problem space  (Rieber  2004).  The  implications  on  any  conjectures  while  solving problems are obtained at once, as learners can 'tinker' to solve a problem. Thus,  microworlds  provide  a  safe  space  to  pose  and  solve  problems  and provide learners with scaffolding in the form of 'objects to think with' and features that allow tinkering.

## Collaboration and microworlds

In the pre-Internet era, collaboration in microworlds was in the form of groups of students working together on projects. Although offline collaborations are possible, we limit our discussion here to online collaborations. The basis of collaboration is the ability to share work with peers. The presence of online fora  and  dedicated  platforms  to  share  work  allows  virtual  collaboration between learners with ease. For this to be possible, the licensing of the content under Creative Commons is crucial to allow for remixing of the content as it allows the users to use content generated by others without difficulty.

Stahl, Rosé and Goggins (2017) presented a novel way of using GeoGebra in an online collaborative environment. Similarly, the online version of NetLogo 21 is specifically designed to enable online collaborations between people using the same models and has features supporting collaborations. In the case of Scratch, both forum-based and studio-based collaborations are possible, and the online interface supports this well, using either the backpack- or the remix tool. In the case of Turtle Blocks, learners can share their work with others and remix the work freely using the 'Global' option.

Online user platforms and appropriate licensing have thus made it easy for collaboration in microworlds.

## Resources and microworlds

The  following  question  was  also  posed  at  the  start  of  this  chapter:  What resources are available to learners and facilitators for microworlds in the SDML context? This issue is highly relevant, as to facilitate SDL as a process, learners must be able to select appropriate resources (cf. Knowles 1975).

21. See http:/ /modelingcommons.org/.

The resources available in microworlds occur at both micro- and macrolevels. At a micro-level, learners can make use of semiotic resources used to communicate with and through microworlds in order to solve problems, run a particular process or set of instructions, or do an experiment. This aspect of micro-resource selection is highly relevant for both individuals and interactional multimodality and can also be considered an important part of SDML.

At a macro-level, learners make use of not only microworlds themselves but also supportive texts and resources. All four microworlds discussed in this study have a wide variety of resources in various formats that can help learners and facilitators  in  the  SDML  context.  Multiple  tutorials  are  available  for  learners (both novice and advanced), and for teachers, teacher manuals are available.

Also,  it  is  significant  that  these  resources  are  available  as  OERs,  which makes their distribution at scale, contextual adaptation and remixing possible. For example, contextual adaptation is evident in the number of languages in which such resources (including user interface) are available.

## Limitations

This research entailed an explorative evaluation of microworlds in the context of SDML. There are several limitations to this research. Firstly, this research was confined to  microworlds  as  data  source,  and  consequently,  the  perspectives of learners and their experiences with microworlds in this context are absent and  the  study  is  limited  to  potentialities  of  SDL-enabling  environments. Secondly, this research did not include any observations of the actual use of microworlds by users or within classroom contexts. Lastly, the selection of four specific microworlds also limits the generalisability of the findings for all possible microworlds or even these in future iterations, as they may have other advantages and/or disadvantages.

## Recommendations for future studies

From the discussion, some possible areas for future research also emerged. Future  studies  in  this  field  can  focus  on  learners  and  facilitators  using microworlds  in  the  context  of  SDML.  Furthermore,  microworld  classroom implementation in the context of SDML could also be explored, with a specific focus  on  learner  agency  in  collaborative  practices  in  the  microworlds supporting SDL. The challenges and opportunities for novice and expert selfdirected learners in the use of microworlds and assessments in microworlds in SDML can be investigated. The potential of learning analytics of microworlds in SDML can be researched further. The affordances of microworlds for SDML and metacognition could also be source of further scholarship.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this study aimed to explore what features of microworlds enable them to be supportive learning environments for SDML. To this end, the design features with the potential to support SDL as well as aspects of multimodal learning were investigated. We also covered elements that would be conducive to  problem-solving  and  collaboration.  Finally,  the  resources  available  to learners and teachers as facilitators were considered.

The features, resources and fora of microworlds as SDL-enabling environments were evaluated. Our analysis indicates that microworlds can be potentially well adapted for SDL, although not without caveats. The importance of learner agency in constructionism is brought into practice via the features of microworlds and, as such, resonates with the principal ideas of SDL. The presence of online platforms and fora allows for diverse expressions of learner self-directedness and opens new avenues for collaboration with peers and mentors.  The  inherent  multimodalities  in  microworlds  are  indicative  of  the versatility in the manner in which they can be used by different learners.

In this context, Papert's idea of 'learning to learn', which can be actualised in microworlds, is especially relevant for SDL. While many learning theories focus on 'pedagogy' (which literally means 'art of teaching'), constructionism, in contrast, focuses on learners and uses the term mathetic (meaning the 'art of learning') as a learning principle (Papert 1980). In this context, a quote from Papert is apt in enabling SDL: 'The kind of knowledge that children most need is the knowledge that will help them get more knowledge' (Papert 1993:139).

All microworlds discussed in this chapter are based and can be accessed on computers and the Internet (for online platforms) and could pose potential challenges for wider implementation in terms of access to connected computers. This  can  be  especially  challenging  when  implemented  in  the  context  of  the Global South.

This  research  was  done  through  the  lens  of  constructionism,  and  the scholarship  of  microworlds  and  SDML  provided  a  theoretical  basis.  The exploratory evaluation and a multimodal content analysis of the four selected microworlds  showed  promise  in  light  of  Francom's  (2010)  principles  of enabling environments for SDL. Moreover, the microworlds showed evidence of not only supporting multimodal learning but also involving various elements of multimodality that could be supportive of effective SDML.

## Abstract

Prompts adapting to students' learning needs during engagement with online tasks are starting to receive increasing attention at school and university level. This  is  one  attempt  of  the  digital-education  movement  set  in  motion  to improve, develop and promote SDL skills, as part of a personalised adaptive

approach to  teaching  and  learning.  In  addition,  SDL  skills  include  learning skills such as goal setting, the use of suitable planning strategies, monitoring strategies and managing the time spent on a task when evaluating the extent to which the learning outcomes were obtained. As these skills become needed for deep learning in the 21st century, prompts reflect growing interest in the field of personalised and adaptive learning systems. While adaptive learning is a promising field for education, stakeholders need to be familiar with how technology facilitates important metacognitive regulation behaviour, such as planning,  monitoring  and  evaluation.  However,  few  studies  have  combined previous  research  on  how  technology  facilitates  metacognitive  regulation with adaptive prompts. The purpose of this chapter is therefore twofold: (1) it offers  a  literature  review  on  technology-based  adaptive  learning  with  an emphasis on the use of adaptive prompts to promote SDL, and, based on this review, (2) proposes a conceptual framework to support research in this field by  providing  evidence  for  the  conditions  of  prompting.  A  review  of  the literature  revealed  various  categories  of  metacognitive  prompts  for  the domains of metacognitive regulation, including prompts to aid in planning, monitoring and evaluating on either a novice, transition or expert level.

## Introduction

Prompts  present  a  form  of  scaffolding,  also  called  guidance,  which  could appear in the form of sentence-starters, hints or checklists that provide clear, interactive  guidance  through  a  cognitive  guidance  system  (Davis  1996). Adaptive online learning environments have the objective of enabling learners' learning by adjusting such interactions with web-based or online tools and content in e-learning environments (Boaler et al. 2018). In these environments, prompts can serve as a useful  tool  to  scaffold  learning.  The  setting  up  of learning scaffolds, such as prompts, in online learning tasks is rarely personal and adaptive. Findings of research (e.g. Azevedo et al. 2010; Boaler et al. 2018) indicate  learning  with  metacognitive  tools  (such  as  adaptive  prompts)  in online environments and involve the deployment of metacognitive regulation (or self-regulation) skills. Although such skills are essential for online learning in general and for personalised and adaptive learning in particular, we believe there is little literature on how, for example, metacognitive regulation can be assisted by technology-based adaptive prompts.

Although the importance of personalised and adaptive learning is generally recognised  and  despite  the  fact  that  adaptive  and  personalised  learning systems create digital learning experiences, there is limited literature on how metacognitive regulation can be promoted as a state or ability of SDL in this context,  as  the  initial  search  using  metacognition  in  technology-based adaptive learning's keywords in Harzing's Publish or Perish software package shows. In our view, this is because of the fact that adaptive learning systems in particular form 'complex' learning environments from a technological and

instructional point of view. At present, however, metacognitive regulation is often recorded methodologically with questions, questionnaires or interviews (see e.g. Jagals &amp; Van der Walt 2018). However, this type of measurement before or after the learning process seems to fall too short to cope with the complex  interaction  of  instructional  goals,  technological  possibilities  and individual needs (Little &amp; McDaniel 2015). Less frequently, we find studies with direct  observation.  In  our  opinion,  however,  it  is  a  possibility  to  obtain differentiated results on this topic on the basis of prototypical or developed applications, when it is directly observed how the promotion of SDL can take place through adaptive prompts or scaffolds and which learning effects result on  learning  behaviour  or  even  learning  performance.  In  a  cyclical  process, both the applications and the research questions could then be differentiated or further developed. On the basis of these reflections, the primary research question that this chapter addresses is: How can adaptive prompts facilitate metacognitive  regulation  during  online  learning to  promote  self-directed learning?

## Theoretical basics

Adaptive  online  learning  typically  involves  technology  procedures  in  an arrangement with generated data to monitor learning process and, by doing so, applies these data to adapt the teaching process to meet learner's learning needs (Azevedo et al. 2010). Yokoyama and Miwa (2020) defined adaptive learning as those data-driven results that inform the approaches to teaching and  remediation,  modified  according  to  each  learner's  online  behaviour, demonstrated  by  their  level  of  attainment,  and  subsequently  anticipating what content, instruction and assessment the learner requires at a particular stage  during  learning.  This  is  in  tune  Bath  and  Bourke's  (2010:2)  blended learning modes which are often described as technological supportive learning that is self-directed in nature.

Metacognitive  regulation,  in  light  of  this  process,  refers  then  to  the behaviour to plan,  monitor  and  evaluate  the  learning  experiences  (Little  &amp; McDaniel 2015). To plan, the learner can select a particular task or strategy, read a question more than once or draw a diagram to better understand what the task requires (Jagals &amp; Van der Walt 2018). A learner who monitors will continually check if the task calls on specific and relevant prior knowledge and skills, and aim to meet these task requirements. A learner might monitor task performance by checking their answers and make sure the strategy they apply is working for them. At the end, the learner can identify and correct any misconceptions about the task and revise where necessary. To evaluate the progress, the learner can decide if the solution is correct, is meaningful or holds some practical significance. A learner could, for instance, evaluate when asking: 'Is this correct?'

Specifically,  to  prompt  enables  learners  to  plan,  monitor  and  evaluate through the defining characteristics of the metacognitive regulation dimensions. These metacognitive regulation prompts should then refer the learner's thinking to and about the behavioural strategies that they employ when  they  plan,  monitor  and  evaluate  the  learning  experience  (Little  &amp; McDaniel 2015).

In such personalised and adaptive learning situations, prompts need to be personalised to adapt to leaners' needs as they aim to facilitate metacognitive regulation, which develops over time (Imhof, Bergamin &amp; McGarrity 2020). When designing an adaptive course there's always the option not to prompt or  to  prompt  or  to  prompt  adaptively  with  categories  and  subcategories developed to impose prompts across these conditions as: (1) no prompts, (2) non-adaptive prompts, and (3) adaptive prompts. In this sense, the setup of applicable  prompts  for  non-adaptive  and  adaptive  conditions  considers specific prompts for each dimension of metacognitive regulation. For instance, a  learner  who  is  perceived  on  average  level  in  a  standardised  test  can  be assigned to a category of transition learners where they receive prompts to aid them towards an expert category. However, learners who perform above average in the test are assigned to a category of expert learner, where they receive prompts to help them revise their inferences and prior knowledge to be effective for high-knowledge learners.

## Self-directed learning in online learning

The purpose of applying personalised and adaptive learning techniques is to provide adaptive feedback in the form of hints or recommendations that, in this case, are associated with regulatory domain of metacognition. As such, the prompts are believed to steer the meta-level operations (such as planning, monitoring and evaluation) to promote a personalised process of SDL. In this process, the typical behaviour indicated by Knowles (1975) would be stimulated to '(1) take initiative, (2) to diagnose learning needs as in the case of prompting reflective questions for monitoring, (3) formulate learning goals, (4) identify resources for learning, select and implement learning strategies, and evaluate learning outcomes'. In addition, Lounsbury et al. (2009) explained that:

[ S ]elf-directed learning is 'a disposition to engage in learning activities where the individual takes personal responsibility for developing and carrying out learning endeavours  in  an  autonomous  manner  without  necessarily  being  prompted  or guided by other people' (such as a teacher, parent, or peer). (p. 411)

Taminiau et al. (2014) pointed out that SDL skills include learners' choice of learning paths outlined according to their own learning needs. This requires the  use  of  self-assessment,  or  monitoring  of  the  self,  to  reflectively  know which task to select and how to determine, and follow, the path for learning. Monitoring is therefore an indicator of the domain-specific knowledge and

skills that are reflected upon at a certain moment during the task. In Taminiau et al.'s (2014) research, scaffolds were built into an adaptive learning system through a series of task-selection advice on selecting appropriate tasks. The advice served as prompts to elicit SDL skills, including learners' self-assessment and  task  selection  strategies.  Learners  who  follow  the  advice  (prompts) showed  developed  domain-specific  skills  that  are  needed  for  solving  the tasks. In the current project, the task was designed mainly to create recurring opportunities for learners to self-assess their own knowledge, or the limitations thereof is believed to assist them in articulating their thoughts, and this fosters a shared understanding.

## Metacognition in online learning

Tarricone's  (2011)  conceptual  framework  of  metacognition  suggests  that metacognition  consists  of  three  interlinked  concepts:  (1)  metacognitive knowledge,  which  refers  to  the  declarative,  procedural  and  conditional knowledge  about  the  self/person,  task  and  strategy,  (2)  metacognitive regulation, which refers to the planning, monitoring and evaluating behaviour, and (3) metacognitive experiences, referring to personal reflective judgements and  feelings  of  knowing.  The  distinction  between  these  concepts  involves knowing  (or  being  aware  of)  one's  cognition,  managing  (or  regulating) cognition and experiencing the self as learner or thinker. In online learning environments,  a  computer  serves  as  a  metacognitive  tool  in  adaptive  and personalised  learning  and  emphasises  the  state  (current  or  contextual)  of metacognitive behaviour (Khiat 2017). Approaches for assessing this metacognitive  behaviour  in  adaptive  learning  systems  research  involve  a variety  of  methods  and  seem  to  depend  on  the  nature  of  the  measure (Azevedo et al. 2010).

In most cases, it seems that metacognitive knowledge is assessed offline, before and after the engagement with the adaptive learning system (Ozturk 2017), whereas metacognitive regulation is assessed before (in terms of prior knowledge  and  skills),  during  (with  meta-data  of  task  engagement)  and afterwards  (through  simulated-recall  with  reflections  on  recorded  screen playback) (Veenman et al. 2014). There seems to be some confusion in the literature  as  to  when  the  authors  are  measuring  self-regulation  or  metacognitive regulation.  Self-regulation  includes  the  dimensions  of  planning,  monitoring and  evaluation.  As  Hoffman  and  Nadelson  (2010:247)  state,  self-regulated 'individuals  are  cognitively  engaged,  use  self-regulation  strategies  to  plan, monitor, and evaluate learning …'. Researchers seem to use self-regulation and metacognitive regulation interchangeably. Because metacognitive regulation can  act  as  a  trait  and  a  state  in  problem-solving  (Azevedo  et  al.  2015), indicators of metacognitive regulation are needed to measure this construct online and during task-engagement.

Research into metacognitive regulation focuses on how learners monitor and  control  their  thinking,  beliefs  and  strategies  (Hadwin,  Järvelä  &amp;  Miller 2011).  As  learners  can  regulate  their  behaviour,  cognition  and  affective experiences,  this  regulatory  behaviour  can  be  considered  as  observable actions to show or indicate the metacognitive skill of planning, monitoring or evaluating.  Pudło  and  Pisula  (2018)  explained  that  reaction  time  can  be determined to categorise and validate metacognitive indicators of planning, monitoring and evaluation.

## Adaptive prompting as a metacognitive design perspective

Lu et al.'s (2012:171) theoretical framework of web-based SDL was utilised in this  analysis as it provides the necessary 'structure categories, dimensions, and aspects'.  Research  on  prompts  as  forms  of  scaffolds  to  enhance  SDL, adaptive  and  personalised  learning  is  still  new  in  the  field  of  mathematics education. Education stakeholders, including mathematics teachers, curriculum developers and administrators, need to become familiar with ways to facilitate metacognitive regulation in adaptive learning environments. The problem is that few studies have synthesised research in this field to identify and  develop  prompts  to  facilitate  regulation  behaviour  such  as  planning, monitoring  and  evaluation.  As  metacognitive  regulation  can  promote  SDL skills (Jagals &amp; Van der Walt 2018), an overview of relevant literature is critical to enhance  mathematics  education  stakeholders' understanding  about adaptive learning. To address this need, a literature review was conducted.

Scaffolding  is  defined  as  the  assistance  given  to  a  learner  during  taskengagement when they need it and gradually removing some or all of the scaffolds  as  learning  progresses  (Davis  1996).  Research  indicated  that scaffolds in technology-based adaptive learning environments are useful for learners  to  regulate  their  learning  (Veenman  et  al.  2014).  Metacognitive scaffolds can therefore be regarded as those scaffolding required to facilitate metacognitive regulation skills, by providing examples, prompts and hints on how,  when  and  what  to  plan,  monitor  and  evaluate  -  in  other  words,  the prompts  draw  the  learner's  attention  to  the  declarative,  procedural  and conditional  knowledge  (Imhof  et  al.  2020).  Examples  of  metacognitive prompts that serve as scaffolds that can be implemented in an online learning platform include the providing of scaffolding messages or prompts based on a literature review, as well as the availability of examples of similar tasks during task-engagement.

Scaffolds can also include a diagnosis during which a computer program or online platform prepared with a unique learning algorithm will intervene in the learning process by having diagnosed a particular learning habit and therefore adapts the system by providing a different protocol, or self-diagnoses during

which a learner can reflect  on  the  provided  hints  and  prompts  as  cues  to facilitate the planning, monitoring and evaluating behaviour associated with metacognitive  regulation  (Azevedo  et  al.  2010).  For  illustrative  purposes, some  examples  of  the  underpinning  characteristics  of  these  indicators  of metacognitive regulation skills and behaviour in online platforms are outlined in Table 5.1.

Neubrand  and  Harms  (2017)  explained  that  prompts  can  serve  as independent variables that call onto particular skills during the engagement or solving of online tasks. In personalised and adaptive learning environments, these  prompts  need  to  scaffold  the  personalised  learning  as  they  aim  to promote the learner's capacity to draw on and execute their metacognitive regulation behaviour, which progresses over time because of the familiarity of the prompts and the awareness of the prompted skills (Neubrand &amp; Harms 2017). Three different categories to develop and impose such metacognitive prompts include the determined prompt conditions as: (1) no prompts, (2) non-adaptive prompts, and (3) adaptive prompts (Neubrand &amp; Harms 2017).

Figure 5.1 illustrates these different conditions along with corresponding categories of prompts that are aligned with particular metacognitive regulation behaviour.

The setup and design of applicable metacognitive prompts for the condition of  non-adaptive  and  adaptive  prompting  consider  specific  categories  and types of prompts for each dimension of metacognitive regulation. For instance, prompts  first  need  to  align  with  the  specific  planning,  monitoring  and evaluating activities as determined by the task and are anticipated by the task sequence or level of cognitive difficulty (Neubrand &amp; Harms 2017). An adaptive system must therefore be set up to assign to learners, on an individual basis, a particular condition of prompting, in such a manner that they will benefit from  the  prompt  -  which  will  scaffold  the  type,  category  and  prompt conditions. Following this, the system also assigns to each learner a category within  that  condition.  Such  a  prompt-by-category  condition  will  therefore differ in each case.

In  the  study by Neubrand and Harms (2017), for instance, learners were assigned to prompt conditions according to their performance in a standardised test (such as Annual National Assessments or Trends in mathematics Science Surveys common in mathematics and physical science programmes). Learners' test performances further assist to being assigned to the applicable prompt condition categories (i.e. the learner is on a novice, transition or expert level). Learners who then measure with a low performance profile in the standardised test, therefore, are assigned to a category of novice learners based on their prior knowledge. These transition stage learners receive prompts that enable them to improve their performance in the subject so that they can achieve a

higher performance. Learners who then measure on an average level in the standardised testing are then assigned to a transition level where they receive metacognitive prompts that aid them towards an expert stage. Learners who perform  above  average  in  the  standardised  test  are  then  assigned  to  a category of expert learner, where they receive set prompts to help them revise their  inferences  and  prior  knowledge,  and  in  so  doing,  they  can  be  more effective as high-knowledge learners (Neubrand &amp; Harms 2017).

## Personal and adaptive learning systems

Collectively, the theoretical basics outlined above inform the development of a conceptual-theoretical framework for this study, illustrated in Figure 5.2.

The  framework  depicted  in  Figure  5.2  serves  as  a  broad  outline  of  the preliminary conceptual-theoretical framework of this project, viewed through the lenses of a learner model, an adaptive model and a domain model, from Imhof et al. (2020), and modified for the purpose of fostering metacognition and SDL through adaptive learning prompts. This framework therefore serves as a theoretical basis for this study and provides a practical application of the theoretical framework to focus on the learner for whom the adapted learning system  is  created  and  prompts  are  designed.  In  this  adaptive  system,  the learner  engages  with  a  series  of  tasks,  which  could  include  scaffolds (i.e. prompts, hints and examples) and which serve as tools to elicit signs or indicators of their metacognitive regulation. The purpose of these tools and signs (the tasks and scaffolds) is set and aimed to facilitate metacognitive regulation behaviour, and this is the object of this activity system. In turn, it is believed that once metacognitive regulation is facilitated, the learner can be (more) self-directed as the outcome of the activity system.

Vagale  and  Niedrite  (2012)  explained  the  learner  model  as the  user  or student model which represents the learner or student. This model embodies

the qualities including attributes such as gender, prior knowledge and skills, particular learning styles or the affective state. These measured qualities are then  conveyed  to  the  adaptive  model  which  combined  the  information gathered from the learner model with information in the course or curriculum design that is situated in the domain model.

According to Coertjens (2018), such an adaptive and personalised learning system  that  can  facilitate  metacognition  in  adaptive  and  personalised instructional designs consists of:

- 1. a concept of a particular task or goal to reach
- 2. design a user friendly online platform to generate learning experiences
- 3. intelligent instruction to provide hints for appropriate correction
- 4.  a workflow space for learner creations in the form of written reflections
- 5.  a mechanism to oversee learner workflow
- 6.  an instructional workflow for the lecturer's administration
- 7. a database for  online  exercises  categorised  according  to  the  learner's personal learning behaviour.

To apply the core components identified by Imhof et al.'s (2020) model of the core components of adaptive learning systems, the following questions can be phrased:

- 1. Why should the prompt(s) be adapted?
- 2.  What prompt(s) should be adapted?
- 3.  What should the prompt adapt to?
- 4.  Where and when can this prompt be applied?
- 5.  How does the prompt adapt?

These questions are revisited in the discussion section of this chapter as a response to each based on a sampled and analysed literature set as application of  the  model  and  exploring  of  the  adaptations  of  prompts  to  facilitate metacognitive awareness.

## Methodology

Setting  up  these  prompts  to  facilitate  metacognitive  regulation  in  online learning tasks seldom personalises the learning experience, and this is perhaps because of a gap in  the  literature  to  report  on  such  procedures.  As  metacognitive regulation is an important measure of SDL (source), prompts that facilitate metacognitive regulation could promote SDL skills. We adopted the conceptual analysis procedure by Avella et al. (2016). According to Avella et al. (2016), this procedure consists of (1) formulating the problem, (2) collecting the data, (3) evaluating  the  appropriateness  of  the  data,  and  (4)  analysing  the  data, interpreting and organising the results. To do so, we applied the results to compose a conceptual framework which can be applied to the development

of a prototype set of prompts or for the development of an online learning platform. To determine what prompts can facilitate metacognitive regulation in technology-based learning platforms, we searched for studies relevant to metacognition in technology-based adaptive learning using Harzing's Publish  or  Perish  software  package  (version  6.3.4.6288.6798).  The  programming nature  of  the  Publish  or  Perish  software  allows  the  user  to  look  up scholarly citations and calculate citation and impact metrics on a search query entered.

We assigned the following keywords as queries in the software platform: regulation and SDL, with plan, monitor, evaluate and prompt to search for and identify relevant sample sources. We also added the keyword 'mathematics' in the search to specify sources relevant to the context of the study. The purpose was  to  search  for  and  find  sources  that  self-identify  as  investigating  or exploring the affordances and qualities of metacognition to promote SDL. The initial  search  produced  87  results  of  sources  published  between  the  years 2003 and 2018. Essentially the codes-to-theory model for qualitative inquiry by Saldaña (2015) allowed us to code, categorise and align sources with the themes: (1) Metacognitive regulation, (2) SDL and (3) Prompting. After the themes  were  identified,  we  assigned  categories  with  codes  such  as  MCR (metacognitive regulation), SDL, P (planning), M (monitoring), E (evaluation) and Pr (prompt) to the read text. A study of the words, phrases, sentences or sections related to the category determined if the source suggests any advice on  the  use  and  development  of  prompts  applied  in  adaptive  learning environments.  In  the  sections  that  follow,  we  applied  Avella  et  al.'s  (2016) technique.

## Formulating the problem

A systematic approach, such as that offered in this chapter, identifies prompts to  aid  in  adaptive  learning  experiences.  These  prompts  can  be  set  up  to facilitate metacognitive regulation skills of planning, monitoring and evaluating task performance online. As metacognitive regulation is an important measure of  SDL  (Neubrand  &amp;  Harms  2017),  prompts  that  facilitate  metacognitive regulation could promote SDL skills. Based on this reasoning, the following research question guides the literature review: What prompts can facilitate metacognitive regulation in technology-based learning platforms?

## Data collection and data evaluation

The purpose was to search for and find sources that self-identify  as  investigating or exploring the affordances and qualities of metacognition to promote SDL.

The initial search produced 87 results of sources published between the years 2003 and 2018. To cull the search results further, we identified only the

most applicable  ones  after  a  proper  evaluation  by  reading  through  them and then determining their alignment with the conceptual framework of the study.  We  then  followed  the  inclusion  criteria  advice  from  Winters  et  al. (2008:432).

Firstly, studies had to refer to empirical evidence and be peer-reviewed. In the  case  of  dissertation  studies,  these  were  not  included.  Further,  a  clear description of the participants of these studies, as well as the methods and results  sections  should  be  provided.  Secondly,  'regulation'  or  'self-directed learning' had to be a primary focus of the study, or advancing or promoting SDL, as determined by reading the abstract and introduction. Thirdly, online instructional systems must be the primary instructional modality and context of the study, while using prompts as learning scaffolds. After the evaluation, we identified 28 sources for the literature sample, considered to be suitable for the analysis towards answering the research question (Table 5.2).

## Analyses of the data

We analysed sources in the literature sample set through deductive content analysis by reading and rereading them. The purpose of the analysis was to search for and identify text or phrases in the content which represented or discussed the keywords ascribed to them, or associated with one or more of the other keywords in the initial online sample search.

Essentially the codes-to-theory model for qualitative inquiry by Saldaña (2015) allowed us to code, categorise and align sources with the themes of: (1) Metacognitive regulation, (2) SDL and (3) Prompting. After these themes were identified, we assigned categories with codes such as SDL, P (planning), M (monitoring), E (evaluation) and Pr (prompt) to the read text. We made use of ATLAS.ti as a qualitative data analysis package to show the frequency of text  through  both  ATLAS.ti  auto-coding  and  manual  coding  functions  for reasons of consistency and validity of that particular code or category. A study of the words, phrases, sentences or sections related to the category determined if  the source suggests any advice on the use and development of prompts applied in adaptive learning environments.

## Presentation of results

Using ATALS.ti automated coding, Table 5.3's frequencies could be determined. These frequencies indicate the number of in-text corresponded to statements made in the text following the sampled phrases and extracts of text.

Table  5.3  (see  also  the  Addendum  for  a  complete  list  of  the  sampled references)  summarises  the  results  of  the  literature  study  and  represents sampled phrases and extracts from the identified sources that elicit reflection on prompts when carrying out tasks. Table 5.3 shows sampled literature sets as sources reporting on metacognitive regulation components and SDL. In sample literature set 23 (by Bannert 2006), for example, the frequency of codes for the  theme  of  SDL  shows  sources  with  a  high  frequency  of  indicators  for prompting (12), reporting little on regulation (2) and SDL (0). In contrast to this, sources with a high frequency of indicators for regulation (e.g. 18) report vaguely on the use of prompts (2) and SDL (1), as the examples show. When these references were reread, they were significantly reduced to the numbers illustrated in Table 5.4. This also provided a more in-depth view on the sampled and analysed literature as the risk of repeated counting of indicators for each theme was reduced. Table 5.4 shows the manual coding where certain phrases in the text were omitted because of them not being related to prompts at all or could not be used as guidelines to formulate prompts.

Publication metrics of the initial search include publications between 2003 and  2018.  Within  15  years,  87  papers  were  published  with  1092  citations.

Only 13 of these papers were available freely in a portable document format (pdf), and only 16 of these papers reported on research done in mathematics education  contexts.  For  the  purpose  of  the  chapter,  only  the  theme  of prompting (Pr) will be considered using Figure 5.1's hierarchy of prompts as a classification system, reported on here in terms of the prompt's condition, the category and the type of prompt. The metacognitive themes of evaluation, monitoring, planning and metacognitive regulation in addition to the SDL can be used to assist in formulating prompts according to these conditions.

The results  presented  below  as  quotations  offer  guidelines  for  prompts based on the condition and type of prompting. These statements are borrowed from  the  sampled  literature  sets,  particularly  those  which  indicate  high frequencies in Table 5.3 and Table 5.4's auto and manual coding of the theme of prompts.

## Prompts for planning

The theme of planning seemed to have received the highest frequency of codes in the analysed sample set with 1299 autocoded codes and 414 manual codes. Even though the theme of planning does not explicitly appear in the model by Imhof et al. (2020), the model does emphasise core components of

adaptive learning which imply prompts regarding planning when, where, what and how strategies can be applied. For instance, sample sets 2, 22 and 24 indicate that prompts should allow for learners to 'plan the learning strategies they  use'  (Hollingworth  &amp;  McLoughlin  2005:277),  'set  goals  for  their  own planning, whereas teachers proactively guide students to plan a specific task' (Yen  et  al.  2018:158),  'systematically  order  [and]  plan  a  solution  strategy, deciding  to  execute  it  and  subsequently  monitoring  progress'  (Bannert 2006:211,  217).  In  addition,  prompts  for  planning  should  encourage  'note taking, reading only a part of a text, and estimating a solution to a problem' (Bannert 2006:218), 'preparation of the sequential planning and execution of cognitive  activities  [and]  …  the  development  of  an  action  plan  to  attain learning goals' (Meijer, Veenman &amp; Van Hout-Wolters 2012:561).

## Prompts for monitoring

The high frequency of 542 autocoded and 937 manual codes from the literature reporting on monitoring is in line with Imhof et al.'s (2020:95) model, in that monitoring is 'crucial in this context'. Sample sets 10, 12, 17, 19 and 25 suggest that prompts should cater for (Alleva &amp; Gundlach 2016):

Making  students  aware  of  …  challenges  can  enhance  their  abilities  to  be  more intentional in monitoring their learning about them. […] [ S ]elf-question(ing) both to obtain knowledge and to monitor understanding of it […], determin(ing) if the task is being completed correctly and make corrections as appropriate. (pp. 719, 722)

Furthermore, West, Hill and Song (2018:134, 207) (sample set 17) suggest that 'making cognition more visible, […] demonstrating such practices', and Meijer, Veenman  and  Van  Hout-Wolters  (2012:566)  (sample  set  19)  suggest  that 'planning activities can be directed at the problem-solving approach and/or at a timeframe for task execution'.

Reference to the social-cognitive view of learning as well as applications to problem-solving was also found to relate to discussion on monitoring, with Broadbent and Poon (2015:2) suggesting that 'self-observation (is) seen as the most important of these processes'. Bannert (2006:211) also states that, 'monitoring  of  calculation  errors  during  mathematics  problem-solving  may generate  control  processes  at  the  metacognitive  level,  which  may  lead  to correction of these errors'.

## Prompts for evaluating

Across the literature sample, evaluation was the theme among metacognitive regulation domain that deemed necessary when coded with the frequency of 660 codes for the auto coding process and 585 codes for the manual coding process.  This  implies  that  evaluation  is  emphasised  in  adaptive  learning process, as Imhof et al. (2020) also noted. Sample sets 1, 14, 17 and 25 indicated

the  most  references  to  evaluation.  It  appears  from  these  references  that prompts should provide opportunities where (Crippen &amp; Antonenko 2018):

[ S ]pecial attention is given to explicating the differences between well-structured (textbook) and ill-structured (authentic) problems in order to enable educators to evaluate and compare the complexity, structuredness, and dynamicity of various types of problems. (p. 104)

These educators should then 'reflect on their actions and decisions in order to evaluate goals, processes, and efforts' (Michalsky 2014:214), 'directly and explicitly  inform  students  about  the  significance  of  a  strategy  and  about how to employ, monitor,  and  evaluate  this  strategy'  (Michalsky  2014:217), 'analyse,  synthesize,  and  evaluate  information  in  ill-structured  and  wellstructured asynchronous online learning environments' (West, Hill &amp; Song 2018:139.

Although the literature review indicated that SDL can be fostered by selfregulation skills such as planning, monitoring and evaluation, there were also particular references in the sampled and analysed literature set that suggest specific prompts for SDL.

## Prompts for self-directed learning

The theme of prompts for SDL showed the smallest number of autocoded (400) and manually coded (162) frequencies. This low frequency, especially when compared to the metacognitive regulation domain of monitoring, is not surprising as the introductory remarks of this chapter emphasised that there is a scarcity of literature reporting on how metacognitive regulation can be promoted as a state or ability of SDL in online learning environments. The few extracts that do offer guidance for prompting SDL behaviour include those found in sample sets 10 and 12: 'encouraging students to use highquality  learning  activities  […]  (advocating  that  teaching  for  intentional learning in experiential courses' (Alleva &amp; Gundlach 2016:711, 715), 'the very nature of online settings promotes self-directed learning' (Broadbent and Poon 2015:2).

## Discussion

The study followed a literature review approach with the intention to identify adaptive  prompts  to  facilitate  metacognitive  regulation  during  online learning.  The  conceptual-theoretical  framework  served  as  a  proposition regarding the condition of prompting and its application according to Imhof et al.'s (2020) model of the core components of adaptive learning systems and facets of the design process, as modified for the purpose of this study. Based on the analysis, distinct prompts can be organised according to the level of expertise (either novice, in transition or expert) and aligned with the

particular sequence of the activity. These different categories of prompts can be aligned with the different conditions, as per the sequence of an activity. Following Imhof et al.'s (2020) framework as theoretical model for this study, three sets of conditions for prompting were confirmed by the analysis of a sampled literature set (see Table 5.2). In the discussion sections that follow, each  of  these  conditions  are  explained  with  guidelines  based  on  the theoretical framework followed by examples of metacognitive prompts.

There are, however, conditions where no prompting is required. In such cases,  the  analysed  literature  sample  set  indicates  that  no  prompts  are needed when prior knowledge, skills  or  affective  states  are  tested  (Imhof et al.  2020) as part of diagnosing an aspect of the learner's learning. Noprompting  conditions  can  also  serve  well  in  situations  where  exploratory, convergent research designs are followed where the no-prompting groups often serve as validation or comparison group, to determine any effects the non-adaptive prompting and adaptive prompting conditions might have had on the learners' SDL.

## The condition of adaptive prompting

Adaptive  prompting  requires  as  a  prerequisite  a  framework  with  several prompting steps that adapt to the individual needs of the learner. Important in this context are the characteristics of the learner, which are modelled in the adaptive  system.  The  literature  review  suggests  that  prompting  provides guidance that benefits both novices and experienced students. Prompts can lose  their  effectiveness  and  stay  counterproductive  to  experts.  Adaptive learning  prompts  can  support  novice  learners  who  need  guidance  by,  for example,  limiting  the  number  of  alternative  response  options  or  providing access to additional resources such as Wikipedia, online assessment tools or other relevant links (Imhof et al. 2020)

Prompts designed in a clear and guiding manner can assist novice learners and hinder expert learners  because  of  too  much  instruction  with  negative effects at a motivational level (Imhof et al. 2020). If the learner receives too little assistance, it can also affect novice learners who do not have the expertise to determine what the task requires is and, in addition, receive too limited support  to  develop  and  apply  the  necessary  problem-solving  strategies. However, in the opposite case, if the guidance provided by the prompts is too extensive,  cognitive  overload  may  occur,  so  a  step-by-step  approach  is appropriate to guide them through the task. The novice learner may receive supplementary clarifications, explanations, descriptions and hints to improve his or her understanding of the content and to support solving procedures of a  task.  Another  way  of  adapting  prompts  in  scaffolds  can  be  by  applying instructional techniques for novice learners (Avella et al. 2016) and differentiating them from those for experienced learners.

At the end of this section, let us give an explanatory example. One problem with good automated feedback concerns open-ended questions, for example. In  order to evaluate corresponding text answers automatically and provide them  with  feedback,  very  sophisticated  intelligent  algorithms  are  needed, which usually have to be trained over several years and need deep knowledge of artificial intelligence. An alternative to this are metacognitive prompts, such as  that  we  use  in  some  cases  at  the  Swiss  Distance  University  of  Applied Sciences. For example, after entering a text, a student can be asked to compare their answer with that of a peer or a standard solution and to rate the extent of the difference based on a Likert scale. Depending on the result, the students are asked to justify their answer. The question about the justification can then, for example, be unspecific in the case of a small difference and divided into several steps with different aspects (e.g. length of the justification, contain key terms and logical errors) in the case of a larger difference. The aim here is to optimise the cognitive load in the context of the prompts or to adapt them to the learner's knowledge. This example is only intended as an illustrative one. Basically, the possibilities of adaptation in such a context are inexhaustible, and there are no limits to the didactic imagination. However, we also do not want  to  conceal  here  that  the  construction  and  implementation  of  such metacognitive adaptive prompts require empirical testing with regard to the learning effects and the acceptance of the students. Based on our experience, there  are  always  unexpected  surprises  in  this  context  that  allow  for  an improvement of the prompts.

## Conclusion

The  chapter  presents  a  tangible  pedagogical  approach  to  identify  adaptive prompts for facilitating metacognitive regulation in online learning environments which  can  easily  be  inserted  into  online  learning  systems.  To  do  so,  the prompts should be prepared (and therefore prototyped) in terms of the opportunities and experiences they provide to plan, monitor and evaluate the learning experiences. This prerequisite of the prompts serves as a guiding principle along  with the questions  posed  in  the conceptual-theoretical framework (see Figure 5.2) for the development and implementation of the adaptive prompts, particularly focusing on why, what, when, where and how the prompts should be adapted. The findings inform the defining of adaptive prompts needed within this system and motivate a pilot study of the prototype before the initial system is put in place. Several limitations could be considered to ensure the conditions of prompting are met, for instance, to determine the learners' prior knowledge and experience in terms of their knowledge and skills, as well as the familiarity with adaptive systems. Moreover, future research could develop adaptive learning systems that explore the applicability of the identified conditions  of  prompting  and  examine  the  role  prompts  play  in  facilitating metacognition towards promoting SDL during online learning experiences.

## Abstract

Self-assessment  is  an  essential  skill  for  the  development  of  self-directing learners.  However,  it  is  seldom  an  explicit  learning  objective  in  most university-level  courses  and  programmes.  This  chapter  describes  how knowledge  surveys  support  the  development  of  self-assessment  skills  in courses and programmes. We use knowledge survey data from a national study of science literacy using the Science Literacy Concept Inventory to illustrate several graphical formats for analysing self-assessment results. The results confirm  that  greater  self-assessment  accuracy  correlates  with academic rank, commitment to science, and demonstrated science literacy. We also confirm differences in self-assessment that correlate with several socioeconomic variables, including gender, race and ethnicity, status as a first-generation  college  student,  and  English  second  language  speakers. Additionally, we describe how different applications of knowledge surveys compare with other typologies of self-assessment. Because self-assessment is crucial in informing important educational and career decisions, we offer examples  showing  how  to  use  knowledge  surveys  to  integrate  selfassessment  into  courses  and  programmes.  We  argue  for  deliberately teaching self-assessment in all curricula. Doing so supports more inclusive and equitable learning environments and societies.

## Introduction

When one fully acquires the capacity for SDL, one knows how to learn and is prepared for lifelong learning. Research on lifelong learning has been variously described using the terms 'self-regulated learning' and 'self-directed learning', and a review of the extensive body of literature is beyond the scope of this chapter.

Central to most models of self-directed and self-regulated learning (SRL) (e.g. Cosnefroy &amp; Carré 2014; Dinsmore, Alexander &amp; Loughlin 2008; Loyens, Magda &amp; Rikers 2008) is a quality termed self-efficacy -  an  informed  confidence in self to achieve, over a reasonable amount of time, what one wants to learn through effort and, where needed, instruction from others (Bandura 1982). Ross (2006) argued further that practice in self-assessment offers a path to the development of self-efficacy. Self-assessments involve self-rated estimations of one's capability, at the present time, to engage with specific challenges. Every experience of engaging with a new challenge then provides prompt feedback about the accuracy of one's estimated present capabilities to perform.

Accuracy in the self-assessments of one's knowledge and abilities is central to metacognition (e.g. Dunlosky &amp; Metcalfe 2009), for the development of

SRL (Zimmerman 1990) and SDL (Knowles 1975), and for succeeding with the challenging coursework inherent in pursuing careers in science (Nix, PerezFelkner &amp; Thomas 2015; Perez-Felkner, Nix &amp; Thomas 2017). Thus, self-assessment  is  the  essential  building  block  for  developing  self-efficacy and SDL. Without mastering the ability to self-assess accurately, development of the latter qualities remains out of reach. Despite the importance of accurate self-assessment of one's abilities for lifelong learning (Boud &amp; Falchikov 2006) and meaningful career and life decisions (Sheldrake, Mujtaba &amp; Reiss 2015), self-assessment  is  seldom  an  explicit  learning  objective  in  college-level courses and programmes.

Until  recently,  the  consensus  established  by  prevalent  self-assessment literature  depicted  most  people  as  holding  overly  optimistic  views  of  their knowledge.  Some  researchers  even  suggested  that  self-assessments  of competence were unrelated to actual capabilities. The authors of this chapter include those who recently discovered that these dominant consensus views were  untenable  because  they  rested  on  flawed  mathematical  arguments (Nuhfer et al. 2016a, 2017; Watson et al. 2019).

A lack of readily available tools and methods poses an additional challenge for teachers who wish to investigate self-assessment in the classroom and the laboratory. In this chapter, we focus on knowledge surveys as tools uniquely suited  for  supporting  learning,  teaching  and  intellectual  development.  We also summarise current knowledge on how to analyse and present the results from self-assessment measures.

Measuring self-assessment and improving learners' capacities to self-assess are  often  seen  as  separate  methods  or  activities,  which  further  complicate incorporating  self-assessment  into  teaching  and  research.  We  now  know that  different  socioeconomic  groups  exhibit  self-assessment  characteristics that  impact  both  academic  success  and  life  decisions.  We  believe  that  a commitment  to  develop  the  essential  self-assessment  skills  needed  by  all students can remove barriers that privilege has constructed and that currently impede the achievement of particular learners. By acting on what we now know, we can change our institutions into more effective places in which to learn.

## Our goals for this chapter are to:

- 1. examine several alternative graphical formats for presenting selfassessment results
- 2.  document  the  distinct  characteristics  of  self-assessments  derived  from different populations using different measures
- 3.  describe explicit uses of knowledge surveys for supporting teaching and learning of self-assessment
- 4.    situate knowledge surveys in the body of scholarship on self-assessment.

This chapter employs new knowledge about self-assessment to improve understanding about developing SDL. We confirm that people can learn to do accurate self-assessment and introduce ways for teaching and measuring it. We hope to communicate the value of accurate self-assessment for nourishing the development of SDL using examples of different kinds of lesson design that  provide  students  with  regular  self-assessment  practice  and  prompt feedback.

In  order  to  understand  how  SDL  develops  through  self-assessment,  it  is necessary  to  first  unpack  the  two  concepts.  The  most  widely  quoted  and accepted definition of SDL is that of Knowles (1975) who stated that SDL is:

[ A ]  process  in  which  individuals  take  the  initiative,  with  or  without  the  help  of others, in diagnosing their learning needs, formulating learning goals, identifying human and material resources for learning, choosing and implementing appropriate learning strategies, and evaluating learning outcomes. (p. 18)

Beckers et al. (2019:2) noted that although several definitions of SDL exist, all definitions include 'self-assessment of performance, identification of learning needs and subsequent formulation of points for improvement'.

Reviews of self-assessment research (e.g. Andrade 2019) consistently call for  clearer  definitions  of  self-assessment.  Boud  and  Falchikov  (1989:529) described self-assessment as 'the involvement of learners in making judgements about their own learning, particularly about their achievements and the outcomes of their learning'. Panadero, Jonsson and Strijbos (2016b) further  defined  self-assessment  to  include  a  spectrum  of  techniques  that students use to assess and evaluate the qualities of their own learning process. According  to  Reddy  et  al.  2015  (as  quoted  in  Lubbe  &amp;  Mentz  2019),  selfassessment encourages students to continually ask reflective questions about their learning and in this process enable themselves to diagnose their learning needs (an imperative for SDL). In championing the effects of self-assessment on  intrinsic  motivation,  effort,  goal  orientation  and  learning,  McMillan  and Hearn (2008:40) asserted that 'student self-assessment stands alone in its promise of improved student motivation and engagement, and learning'.

Also embedded in the concept of SDL is SRL, which occurs when students 'self-generate thoughts, feelings, and actions that are planned and cyclically adapted to the attainment of personal goals' (Zimmerman 2000:14). Feedback has traditionally been connected with SRL (e.g. Black &amp; Wiliam 1998; Butler &amp; Winne  1995),  and  most  models  of  SRL  include  phases  (e.g.  forethought, performance and appraisal) that involve cyclically implemented reflection and self-assessment  (Yan  2020;  Zimmerman  &amp;  Schunk  2001).  When  students engage  in  self-assessment,  they  become  more  active  agents  in  their  own

learning (Schraw &amp; Dennison 1994) and improve their SRL strategies (Panadero, Jonsson &amp; Botella 2017). This also leads to students engaging in praxis where action and reflection are in constant interplay.

Brandt (2020:12) noted that several approaches may be utilised to promote SDL: 'experiential learning, PBL, project-based learning, inquiry-based learning, personalised learning, competency-based learning, self-assessment and online and distance learning'. All of these approaches specifically support SDL because of their focus on choice and personalisation and also agency (King &amp; Siddiqui 2011; Nieminen &amp; Tuohilampi 2020) and responsibility (Brandt 2020:12). Seifert and Feliks (2018) emphasised the use of self-assessment and peer-assessment to promote students' sense of responsibility for their own learning (i.e. SDL).

From the definitions above, one becomes acutely aware of the necessity for  adequate  self-assessment  skills  if  the  aim  is  to  promote  SDL.  Beckers, Dolmans and Van Merriënboer (2016:37) specifically researched the use of e-portfolios (as a self-assessment tool) to promote SDL. Although they found five groups of factors that influence the promotion of SDL skills when using e-portfolios (e.g. the students' motivation [or lack thereof], their perceived time  to  complete  self-assessments,  low  technological  competence,  their awareness of the need to self-improve and their multiple goal orientations), we focus on the 'personal factors' in this chapter. This group (personal factors) describes the influences the individual/student themselves have on their SDL development.

Apart  from  Beckers  et  al.'s  (2016)  notion  about  the  influences  of  selfassessment on students, Ratminingsih,  Marhaeni  and  Vigayanti  (2018)  also made a case for using self-assessment as a teaching strategy for prompting students'  metacognitive  awareness  and  awareness  of  their  skills  (aspects that strongly correlate with SDL). Further, Ratminingsih et al. (2018) found that self-assessment increases students' independence - also an important aspect in SDL. It becomes evident that using self-assessment holds positive results for SDL development.

## Knowledge surveys

The  initial  application  of  knowledge  surveys  for  enhancing  teaching  and learning across courses and curricula occurred over a decade ago (Nuhfer 1993,  1996;  Nuhfer  &amp;  Knipp  2003).  Knowledge  surveys  consist  of  learning objectives  framed  as  challenges  to  be  addressed  by  a  student.  Individual survey  items  describe  detailed  learning  objectives,  which  can  be  either knowledge or skill-based. Teachers craft the items to address specific levels of understanding (Bloom 1956). In completing a knowledge survey, respondents do not directly respond to the questions, but instead provide ratings of their self-assessed ability to do so at that time.

Several  authors  described  the  varied  ways  in  which  knowledge  surveys promote teaching and learning in courses. Because students interact with the surveys  at  several  critical  points  throughout  a  course,  they  support  the development of metacognitive processes, including planning, monitoring and self-assessment  (Bell  &amp;  Volkmann  2011;  Favazzo,  Willford  &amp;  Watson  2014; Goodson, Slater &amp; Zubovic 2015; Nuhfer &amp; Knipp 2003; Wirth &amp; Perkins 2005). Stapleton (2018) also described the use of knowledge surveys for supporting 'non-traditional pedagogies' (e.g. simulations and games) in a political science course. Nuhfer and Knipp (2003), Wirth and Perkins (2005) and Wirth, Perkins and Nuhfer (2005) advocated the use of knowledge surveys for assessing learning  at  the  departmental  and  programmatic  levels,  and  Favazzo  et  al. (2014)  reported  the  results  of  using  knowledge  surveys  for  assessing  a microbiology programme.

In the South African context, the use of knowledge surveys has also gained interest.  In  a  recent  study  of  the  use  of  technology-supported cooperative learning  by  one  of  the  co-authors  (R.  Bailey),  students  were  required  to complete a knowledge survey based on the set outcomes of the study unit to be  completed  in  that  week.  Anecdotally,  the  lecturer  responsible  for  the module has commented on the advantages of using such surveys: It sets the learning stage for what is to come and promotes students' ability to delve into the zone of proximal development.

Nuhfer and Knipp (2003) initially offered knowledge surveys to teachers as an efficient method for organising teaching and promoting student learning. Other researchers soon explored knowledge surveys to quantitatively determine the validity of self-assessment. Early reports by Wirth and Perkins (2005), Wirth et al. (2005) and Clauss and Geedey (2010) described student self-estimates that correlated with objective measures and group-averaged self-assessments that aligned closely with average exam results. Some peer-reviewed research (e.g. Bell &amp; Volkmann 2011; Lindsey &amp; Nagel 2015; Price &amp; Randall 2008; Ziegler &amp; Montplaisir 2014) reported self-assessed learning measures that also aligned well with objective measures. However, other peer-reviewed research disagreed (Bowers,  Brandon  &amp;  Hill  2005;  Luce  &amp;  Kirnan  2016).  All  early  investigators employed  small  databases  of  undocumented  reliability,  usually  local  data obtained from the authors' classes. Some even wrote opinions without collecting any data (Ebert-May &amp; Weber 2006). Nuhfer and Knipp (2006) replied that the high reliability of knowledge survey data indicated their value. They observed that weak or negative correlations between knowledge surveys and objective measures  that  were  being  reported  could  be  the  result  of  poorly  aligned instruments or objective measures with low reliability. Nuhfer (2015) used later findings to formulate guidelines for the effective use of paired measures (selfassessed ratings and competency scores) in research.

The above dispute ended when researchers employed validated instruments for the paired measures, large databases from students at diverse institutions

and the reporting of results in peer-reviewed journals (Nuhfer et al. 2016b, 2017; Watson et al. 2019; Wirth et al. 2016). The results confirmed that selfassessed competency is significantly related to demonstrable competence. These findings also upset two decades of behavioural science research that began in 1999 (Kruger &amp; Dunning 1999). Nuhfer et al. (2016b, 2017) revealed in great detail how the literature supporting the notion that many people are 'unskilled and unaware of it' (Dunning-Kruger Effect) rested on interpreting numerical artefacts as human behaviour. The research team later published to show the value of self-assessment when applied to teaching (Wirth et al. 2016) and  to  understanding  the  effects  of  socioeconomic  privilege  on  student success (Watson et al. 2019).

We now know that most people are generally good self-assessors. Further, there are meaningful differences in self-assessment skills in different groups characterised by academic experience, domain expertise and socioeconomic variables.

## Methodology

Four  related  papers  employed  data  similar  to  that  used  for  this  chapter (Nuhfer et al. 2016b, 2017; Walter, Nuhfer &amp; Suarez 2021; Watson et al. 2019). All employed quantified self-assessed competence ratings with scores from a validated test of demonstrated competence (the Science Literacy Concept Inventory  [SLCI]  Nuhfer  et  al. 2016a). The  Inventory  measures  the comprehension of science as a way of knowing by addressing 12 concepts with 25 items with the goal of understanding the level of understanding of science  concepts  among  undergraduate  college  students  in  non-science majors. We employed the SLCI for this study because it is currently the only existing  instrument,  vetted  for  both  validity  and  reliability,  with  a  corresponding, well-aligned instrument for self-assessment measures with similarly documented psychometrics. This chapter differs from our previous published studies (Nuhfer et al. 2016b, 2017; Watson et al. 2019) in that it includes only students  and  professors  from  4-year  undergraduate  programmes.  This restriction enables a better focus on relationships between self-assessment and rank and other relevant variables.

## Participants

We  studied  1540  undergraduate  students  and  professors  -  all  involved  in 4-year  degree  programmes.  at  &gt;13  different  institutions.  The  Institutional Review Boards at California State University - Channel Islands (IRB-105122) and Humboldt State University (IRB-13-019), whose purposes are to protect the rights and safety of persons participating in research, have granted ethical clearance and overseen this human subject research since its inception.

## Instruments

Participants in this study completed a daisy-chain of instruments, including a predicted  global measure,  the  Knowledge  Survey  of  the  Science  Literacy Concept Inventory (KSSLCI), the SLCI and a postdicted global measure. After reading a description of the nature of the SLCI, participants responded to a single-item self-assessment ( predicted global self-assessment ) that prompted participants to impart a self-estimated rating (between 0% and 100%) of their understanding of science literacy. Next, participants completed the KSSLCI (Nuhfer et al. 2016b), which consists of 25 items (Cronbach's alpha = 0.93; Nuhfer et al. 2016b) that are worded identically to those in the SLCI. Participants addressed their self-assessed confidence to answer each item in the KSSLCI with the following response options (Nuhfer et al. 2016b):

- 1. I can fully address this item now for graded test purposes.
- 2.  I have partial knowledge that permits me to address at least 50% of this item.
- 3.    I am not yet able to address this item adequately for graded test purposes.

The SLCI offers 25 multiple choice items (Cronbach's alpha = 0.85; Nuhfer et al.  2016a)  with  four  choices,  only  one  of  which  is  a  correct  answer.  The Inventory  addresses  12  concepts  of  science  literacy  articulated  by  nine researchers  from  four  California  State  University  campuses  (Nuhfer  et  al. 2016a).  The  development  of  this  instrument  and  the  efforts  to  ensure  its validity are described in Nuhfer et al. (2016a, 2016b). A second global selfassessment  measure  prompts  participants  to  impart  a  single-item,  selfestimated  rating,  again  in  percent,  after  completing  the  SLCI  ( postdicted global self-assessment ). Participants complete the self-assessments and the Inventory in a single sitting, so no teaching is involved. This study draws mostly from the paired measures of the KSSLCI and the SLCI, but we occasionally refer to the predicted and postdicted global measures for comparison.

## Design

Several critical aspects separate this research design on knowledge surveys and  self-assessment  measures  from  others'  peer-reviewed  reports.  (1)  We employ a validated instrument (SLCI) with known psychometric properties as our competence measure, rather than a faculty-made test without established psychometric properties. (2) We employ an extensive database of participants in diverse courses representing multiple institutions rather than small studies obtained  in  single  institutions  or  only  in  our  classes.  (3)  The  KSSLCI  is  a knowledge  survey  in  which  the  self-assessments  align  tightly  with  the competence that we are measuring. Because no teaching is involved, there are no factors other than the interaction between participants and the instruments to  consider.  (4)  Participants  take  the  Inventory  and  the  self-assessments

online in a single sitting under the same conditions in which they interact with science literature in real life, with no restrictions and not under timed in-class conditions. Ours is thus a field study done under actual conditions in which participants engage with learning challenges. From this design, we established a strong positive relationship between  self-assessed competence  and demonstrated competence (Nuhfer et al. 2016b, 2017), after which we explored applying  the  relationship  to  understand  the  role  that  privilege  plays  on demographic groups of ethnicity, gender and sexual orientation (Watson et al. 2019).

In this chapter, we report applying a research design from work that we began  over  four  years  ago  (Wirth  et  al.  2016).  We  establish  the  value  of knowledge surveys for (1) promoting student learning in courses and (2) for measuring self-assessment to better understand student learners and learning in our classes.

## Demographic information

The online survey package also prompted participants to provide demographic information after responding to the science literacy items. This information  included  their  educational  background,  intent  to  major  in science, the number of science courses completed, gender, race and ethnicity, and status as a first-generation college student and as an English second language  speaker.  Responses  to  the  educational  background  item  were recoded  into  'academic  rank'  as novices (1st-  and  2nd-year  students), developing experts (3rd- and 4th-year students) and experts (professors). We recoded participant-reported information about race and ethnicity to a binary 'ethnic minority' category (no or yes). Entries in this category include those  in  the  U.S.  National  Science  Foundation  definition  of  historically underrepresented minorities in science, technology, engineering and mathematics  (STEM)  (Black  or  African  American,  Hispanic  or  Latino, American Indian or Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander). This  binary  categorisation  limits  seeing  some  differences  between  these groups  but  allows  supporting  generalisable  statements  from  our  current data. As we grow our database, more granular categorisation is possible. This data set consists only of records with 'female' or 'male' responses to the gender  item  because  few  non-binary  gender  responses  appeared  in  this database. Participants who indicated status as a 'first-generation' college student are generally  understood to be the first  in  their  family  to  seek  a degree  beyond  traditional  K-12  education.  We  recoded  responses  to questions about the number of college science courses that participants had fully completed into 'science courses completed' (none, 1-2, 3-4,  5). 'Science ≥ interest' indicates if a participant was majoring in or intended to major in a science  field  or  not,  as  shown  by  'yes'  or  'no'  participants'  responses, respectively.

## Analysis procedure

We use the differences  obtained  between  self-assessed  ratings  of  science literacy  ( predicted  global ,  KSSLCI, postdicted  global )  minus  the  objective measure  of  science  literacy  (SLCI)  score  to  characterise  individual's  and groups' self-assessment  skills. If one's self-assessment  rating correctly matches  the  test  score  obtained  on  the  objective  measure,  the  difference between  the  two  measurements  will  be  zero  (perfect  self-assessment).  If imperfectly calibrated, the difference obtained by subtracting the objective measure  from  the  self-assessed  rating  represents  an  error.  The  error  can be positive (self-assessed overestimation) or negative (self-assessed underestimation).

We calculated quartile values between the minimum and maximum values of  SLCI  scores  using  SPSS.  The  four  resulting  populations  between  the bounding values (minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile and top) are unequal because of the large interval (between adjacent scores and skewed distribution of scores) resulting from the SLCI instrument. To avoid introducing artificial statistical relationships, we chose to leave the groups as defined by the quartile values rather than rebalance them.

The  distributions  of  values  in  many  of  the  variables  (e.g.  quartiles  of science  literacy) appear  non-normal  (i.e.,  skewed  and  with  unequal variance) and yield significant Kolmogorov-Smirnov test values. Thus, we chose  non-parametric  methods  (e.g.  Mann-Whitney)  for  statistical  tests. Correlations  among  scale  variables  were  calculated  using  Spearman's correlation coefficients ( r s ); biserial correlations ( r b ) were  used  for dichotomous categorical variables. We use   = Z/N 0.5  (Rosenthal 1991) or r Spearman's correlation coefficient ( r s )  to  estimate  practical  significance, or  effect  size,  and  we  adopted  the  guidelines  of  Cohen  (1988,  1992)  for describing practical significance: small effect,   = 0.1 - 0.3; medium effect, r r = 0.3 - 0.5; and large effect, r = 0.5 - 1.0. For data management, coding and statistical analysis, we used Microsoft Excel and IBM SPSS Statistics for Macintosh, version 26 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA).

## Results

Our results focus on comparisons of data from self-assessed and objective measures of competence in science literacy. We explore graphical methods for interpreting self-assessment data, investigate the self-assessment characteristics of different demographic groups and articulate some of the pedagogical options made possible by the knowledge survey instrument. We also compare these results of our previous studies (Nuhfer et al. 2016a, 2016b, 2017; Walter et al. 2021; Watson et al. 2019) using different subsamples of the paired measures database.

## Objective measures of science literacy

We begin with a brief comparison of objective measures of science literacy scores  among  different  demographic  groups  (Table  6.1).  SLCI  scores  as percentages  increase  with  academic  rank,  from  a  median  of  68%  among novices (1st- and 2nd-year students), to 80% among developing experts (3rdand 4th-year students) and to 92% among experts; statistical tests between all  pairs  of  ranks  are  highly  significant  ( p &lt;  0.001  after  adjusting  with  the Bonferroni  correction).  Those  who  indicated  a  greater  interest  in  science scored higher on the SLCI (median = 80%) than those who did not (median = 68%; p &lt; 0.001). The median SLCI scores of those who completed five or more science courses (median = 84%) are significantly different ( p &lt;  0.001  after adjusting  with  Bonferroni  correction)  from  those  with  only  3-4  (median  = 76%;   = -0.41), 1-2 (median = 72%;   = -0.41) and no (median = 68%;   = -0.27) r r r science courses. However, differences among those with 3-4, 1-2 and no prior science  courses  are  not  statistically  significant.  These  results  confirm  that objective measures of science literacy improve with academic rank and with

science interest, but that completing four or fewer science courses does not produce significant improvements in science literacy (SLCI scores). However, a few schools we studied did produce a significant difference with just four (Nuhfer et al. 2016a, 2016b, 2017).

On average, female participants in this paired data set earned a significantly lower SLCI score (median = 76%) compared with male participants (median = 84%; p &lt;  0.001),  but  the  effect  size  is  small  (   =  -0.16).  We  do  not  observe r difference in our current, much larger national data set (&gt;28 809 participants) nor our previous studies, where the SLCI proved gender-neutral (see also Nuhfer et al. 2016b). Another of our team's studies revealed a small gender bias for female respondents not in the sciences (Walter et al. 2021). Elsewhere, Nuhfer et  al.  (2017)  and  Watson  et  al.  (2019)  found  gender  differences  in  science literacy  scores  explained  by  unequal  distributions  of  other  socioeconomic factors (e.g. first-generation college student status, English second-language speakers and interest in science) between the binary gender categories. Analysis of the binary historically underrepresented minority in STEM category indicates that the median SLCI scores of members of a racial or ethnic minority group (64%)  are  significantly  lower  than  those  from  majority  (Caucasian)  groups (80%; p &lt; 0.001,   = -0.35). Furthermore, first-generation college students have r lower SLCI scores (median = 72) than those who are not the first generation in their family to seek a degree (median = 80; p ≤ 0.001,   = -0.22). r

The median scores of English first language speakers (median = 80%) are significantly  higher  than  those  who  are  English  second  language  speakers (median = 64%; p &lt;  0.001, r = -0.24). These results confirm earlier studies using  the  SLCI  and  likely  reflect  the  penalties  exacted  on  those  with  lessprivileged backgrounds (Nuhfer et al. 2016a, 2016b, 2017; Watson et al. 2019).

## Self-assessed science literacy and metrics of expertise

Next, we summarise the results of self-assessments of science literacy, starting with three different metrics of expertise (academic rank, interest in science and  the  number  of  completed  science  courses).  We  might  expect  all  to contribute  to  increased  competence  and  self-assessment  skill  in  science literacy.

Our other paired-measures studies (Nuhfer et al. 2016b, 2017; Watson et al. 2019) also utilised three to four self-assessment measures to understand the nature of self-assessment. In the first measure ( predicted global ), we asked participants to self-assess their science literacy using a single, global query that described the nature of the SLCI. Self-assessed ratings using this measure are moderately correlated ( r s = 0.320; p &lt; 0.001) with objective measures of

science literacy resulting from the SLCI (Table 6.2). Participants next completed the  closely  aligned  25-item  knowledge  survey  (KSSLCI),  which  provided  a more  granular  definition  of  the  meaning  of  science  literacy.  Self-assessed ratings using the KSSLCI are more highly correlated ( r s =  0.624; p &lt;  0.001) with  the  SLCI  than  those  from  the predicted  global measure  ( r s =  0.320; p &lt; 0.001). Participants again self-assessed their science literacy using a single, global measure after completing the 25-item SLCI. Ratings derived from this postdicted global self-assessment measure correlate highly with those from the SLCI ( r s = 0.623; p &lt; 0.001), KSSLCI ( r s = 0.727; p &lt; 0.001) and the predicted global self-assessment ( r s =  0.604; p &lt;  0.001).  These  relationships  confirm that  self-estimates  derived  from  instruments  with  more  granular  prompts (e.g. KSSLCI) correlate more highly with objective measures (SLCI) than those from single-item, global prompts (e.g. predicted global self-assessment).

For each academic rank, the self-assessment errors (rating from the selfassessment minus score from the objective measure) derived from the granular KSSLCI  registered  by  each  academic  rank  are  similar  and  close  to  zero (Table 6.1; Figure 6.1). This result confirms that people tend to over- and underestimate with about equal frequency and magnitude and suggests that selfassessed competence, in aggregate, is well calibrated to objective measures of  competence  in  science  literacy.  This  observation  remains  true  across academic ranks (Nuhfer et al. 2016a, 2017). However, the distributions of the

Note: Median self-assessment errors are near zero for all academic ranks, but that the range of errors decreases with increasing rank. Median values are indicated by thick horizontal lines, the enclosing shaded rectangle outlines the interquartile range, and the top and bottom quartiles are indicated by vertical whiskers; outliers are indicated with open circles.

self-assessment errors vary with academic rank (Figure 6.1), and the range of self-assessment errors recorded by professors is significantly different from those by novices ( p =  0.003; r = -0.11);  the  difference between developing experts and professors is only marginally insignificant ( p = 0.051). Of the two global measures, self-estimates of competence in science literacy from the predicted global measure generate the largest errors, and those generated after completing the 25-item SLCI ( postdicted global ) generally exhibit greater accuracy (Table 6.1).

The self-assessment errors derived from the three self-assessment measures ( predicted global ,  KSSLCI and postdicted global )  generally trend from positive to negative values with increasing academic rank (Table 6.1). Yet,  this  does  not  necessarily  indicate  a  tendency  towards  self-assessed under-estimates  with  increasing  academic  rank.  A  boxplot  of  KSSLCI  selfassessment errors by quartiles of SLCI scores suggests that the median selfassessed errors decrease with increasing objective measures of competence in science literacy (Figure 6.2). However, Nuhfer et al. (2016a, 2017) explained this apparent trend as a numerical artefact produced from the probabilities of obtaining different frequencies of values that come from calculating differences in paired scores and ratings (e.g. self-assessment errors) near the centres and

margins (lowest and highest quartiles) of distributions bounded by the same values. This effect is visible in the asymmetric distributions of the interquartile ranges and minimum and maximum values in Figure 6.2. Because our sample comprises professors with relatively high levels of measured science literacy, their self-assessment errors tend towards more negative values because of the greater range available for under-estimates. Despite the inherent numeracy artefacts  in  plots  such  as  in  Figure  6.2,  the  presence  of  a  self-assessment signal makes these graphs different from similar-looking graphs produced by modelling random noise with random numbers (Nuhfer et al. 2016b). From the lowest  to  highest  science  literacy  quartiles,  self-assessment  errors  derived from the global measures show similar patterns of error values and ranges.

Nuhfer  et  al.  (2016b)  observed  that  commitment  to  science  (intent  to major) had significant positive effects on the objective measures of science literacy  (SLCI).  This  data  set  continues  to  show  the  significant  differences between means of the two categories of both SLCI scores and KSSLCI ratings, as reported by Nuhfer et al. (2016b, 2017) and Watson et al. (2019). However, we  investigated  if  these  also  had  significant  impacts  on  self-assessed competence  in  science  literacy,  given  our  different  approach  to  doing these calculations. The median self-assessment errors derived from the paired KSSLCI and SLCI measures range from 0 to 2 across the four groups in the

science course category (e.g. none, 1-2, 3-4, ≥ 5 science courses), and none of the differences are statistically significant (Table 6.1).

The self-assessment errors (derived from the KSSLCI) between those with (median  =  2)  and  without  science  interest  (median  =  0)  are  significant (Table 6.1), but of little practical effect ( p = 0.007; r = -0.06). Differences in the self-assessment errors between those with and without an intent to major in science are also insignificant for the pre-SLCI global and postdicted global measures. However, the more negative self-assessment error (median = -2) resulting from the predicted global measure for those with a science interest is significantly lower than those without a commitment to science (median = 4; p &lt; 0.001;   = -0.11). In boxplots, the self-assessment errors resulting from all r three  self-assessment  measures  are  narrower  for  those  who  indicated  an interest in science compared with those who did not.

## Self-assessed science literacy and socioeconomic variables

Other demographic variables that have been identified to impact science literacy  and  self-assessment  include  gender,  race  and  ethnicity,  and  firstgeneration college student status (Nuhfer et al. 2016b; Watson et al. 2019). Notably,  the  self-assessment  errors  registered  by  female  respondents  are closer  to  unity  than  those  of  male  respondents  across  all  three  selfassessment  measures  (Table  6.1),  and  except  for  those  derived  from  the predicted global item, all differences are statistically significant ( p ≤ 0.001) but of little practical effect (  &lt; 0.01). Comparing the results of the three selfr assessment measures from those of our binary race and ethnicity category (i.e.  majority  and  historically  underrepresented  minority  groups in STEM), the mean self-assessment errors generated by those from minority groups (medians  =  2-4)  are  consistently  larger  than  those  from  majority  groups (medians = -2-0), but these differences are only significant ( p ≤ 0.001; r &lt; 0.01)  for the predicted  global item.  First-generation  college  students consistently register similar or higher median  self-assessment errors (Table 6.1), but except for those derived from the predicted global measure ( p ≤ 0.001;   &lt; 0.01), all are insignificant. r

Self-assessment errors derived from the predicted global measure often show the greatest magnitudes and differences between different groups (e.g. academic rank, ethnicity, first-generation, first language, completed science courses, science interest and domain expertise; see Table 6.1). The apparent 'magnification' of differential self-assessment error suggests that the predicted global measure presents a relatively unique challenge, especially for individuals from  less-privileged  demographic  categories.  Elsewhere,  such  'feeling  of knowing'  judgements  have  been  attributed  to  cue  familiarity  (Metcalfe, Schwartz &amp; Joaquim 1993).

The correlations reported in Table 6.2 also support the previously described results. Most of the correlations of the SLCI scores with the self-assessment ratings derived from the three measures taken within the socioeconomic groups (e.g. gender, underrepresented minority, first-generation college student and English  second  language speakers) are modest ( r b &lt;  0.40).  The  greatest  of these r -values  generally  comes  from  the  KSSLCI.  Correlations  between  the socioeconomic variables and self-assessment error are considerably lower, and of those that are significant, gender, ethnicity and science interest are the most highly  correlated.  What  emerges  is  a  more  complex  understanding  of  selfassessment that underscores the importance of the nature of the self-assessment query, expertise in the domain and socioeconomic variables.

To  summarise,  our  analysis  of  the  paired  measures  data  set  ( n =  1534) confirms that, in aggregate, most people are relatively accurate self-assessors. Further, there are significant differences in self-assessment accuracy made by different groups of individuals categorised by academic rank, commitment to science, gender and minority groups.

## Discussion

In  this  section,  we  describe  approaches  for  characterising  self-assessment skills  and  improving  teaching  and  learning  through  self-assessment.  We further attempt to illuminate the effects of individual demographic variables on  self-assessment;  explore  a  range  of  pedagogical  uses  for  knowledge surveys for teaching, learning and scholarship; and analyse knowledge surveys in the context of self-assessment typologies.

## Insights from distributions of self-assessment errors

The  numerical  artefacts  which  underlie  the  graphical  approaches  used  to establish  the  Dunning-Kruger  effect  (Kruger  &amp;  Dunning  1999)  have  been extensively  documented  by  Nuhfer  et  al.  (2016b,  2017)  and  Watson  et  al. (2019). These studies provided several approaches that included categorical analyses.  How  else  should  we  illustrate  self-assessment  skills  for  teaching, learning and research that are less susceptible to spurious numeracy effects?

Analyses  of  the  paired  measures  in  the  SLCI  database  confirm  that  selfassessment errors are typically near zero, meaning that in aggregate, people are generally good self-assessors (Nuhfer et al. 2016a, 2017; Watson et al. 2019). Thus, difference scores (self-assessed competence minus objective measure of competence) are unlikely to provide a comprehensive picture of self-assessment when  used  alone.  When  generating  graphs  of  self-assessment  results,  we regularly observe different groups with near-zero self-assessment errors. In the rare cases where we observe relatively large self-assessment errors, they are typically:  (1)  derived  from  a  global  measure  or  (2)  registered  by  a  group dominated by a single demographic. The median self-assessment errors in

Table 6.1 are ≤ ±4 percentage points, except those derived from the predicted global measure.  The  only  other  large  median  self-assessment  errors  result from calculations involving the lowest and highest quartiles of SLCI scores, where ceiling and floor effects limit the range of available ratings for selfassessments.

Nuhfer  (2019)  compared  self-assessments  by  individuals  and  aggregate self-assessments  of  groups.  By  drawing  on  104  randomised  groups  of  50 individuals from the SLCI database, he showed that individuals are generally accurate  at  self-assessment,  and  group  self-assessments  are  even  more accurate. Group knowledge survey means are very accurate predictors of the group  mean  test  scores  of  demonstrated  competency.  From  this  report emerges a classification scheme for the self-assessment accuracy of groups based on the standard deviation of the average group self-assessment errors. Applying  that  approach  to  this  data  set,  we  obtain  estimates  of  good (±3 percentage points), adequate (±6 ppts) and poor (±9 ppts) self-assessment based on the mean standard deviation of randomly generated groups. This standard deviation for groups is less than half the standard deviation for the individuals (1s = 8.38) in this data set.

These results naturally raise the question about the level of self-assessment accuracy that we expect from our students with regular practice and feedback. Given that individual inaccuracy is caused by random inconsistence or 'noise', and  averaging  by  groups  tends  to  attenuate  such  noise,  the  group  selfassessment values may offer a realistic goal. Students who register as good self-assessors, without focused training of the kind that we advocate for here, are accurate within ±10 ppts (Nuhfer et al. 2017). With training and practice, we can help individuals reduce their own inconsistence or 'noise' and possibly get them to achieve accuracy within ± 3 ppts. Work by one of the authors (K. Wirth) with students in his programmes. indicates that this goal is plausible; most (64%) students in a 2nd-year majors course consistently postdict their exam  scores  within  ±5  ppts,  and  &gt;40%  do  so  within  ±3  ppts.  If  such improvements  prove  generalisable,  self-assessment  training  and  practice should significantly boost the capacity of students to do SDL.

Here,  we  describe  a  new  approach  to  interpreting  paired  measures  by limiting our comparisons to groups with similar ranges of competence scores. This approach attenuates the ceiling and floor effects that prove troublesome when studying groups with a broader range of scores. By comparing the selfassessment errors of individuals in different academic ranks who are all in the top quartile of SLCI scores, we reduce the differential contributions from the ceiling effect. We also minimise the impact of individuals' unequal distributions in the different academic ranks across all the SLCI quartiles. In this analysis, we are less interested in the direction of the self-assessment errors and more interested  in  their  relative  magnitudes.  To  facilitate  comparison  of  the

distributions of self-assessment errors, we normalised the absolute value of each  individual's  self-assessment  error  to  the  standard  deviation  of  selfassessments by the expert group (i.e. professors). Figure 6.3 illustrates the distributions of self-assessment errors for each academic rank, normalised to the  standard  deviation  of  those  in  the  expert  group,  and  reveals  more individuals  in  successive  academic  ranks  with  small  self-assessment  errors and fewer individuals with extreme self-assessment errors. Because each rank consists only of the individuals from the highest quartile, the ceiling effect is similar within each categorical group examined. Statistical tests confirm that the  differences  between  novices  and  developing  experts  and  novices  and experts  are  highly  significant  (Mann-Whitney; p &lt;  0.001),  but  the  practical effects are small (  = 0.19 and 0.23, respectively). These observations support r the notion that self-assessment improves with academic experience (Nuhfer et al. 2016b, 2017; Wirth et al. 2016), perhaps independent of knowledge in the domain.

Another  metric  of  self-assessment  also  comes  from  analyses  of  the distributions  of  self-assessment  ratings.  Table  6.3  shows  the  cumulative percentages  of  individuals  with  assessment  errors  classified  following  the

method proposed by Nuhfer et al. (2017). Here, we normalised each individual's self-assessment error (KSSLCI rating-SLCI score) to the standard deviation of self-assessment errors recorded by professors in the sciences (SD = 8.4 ppts), our  sample  with  the  highest  academic  rank  and  domain  expertise.  These standard deviation categories (8.4 ppts, 16.8 ppts, 25.2 ppts and 33.6 ppts) approximate the classification cut-offs used by Nuhfer et al. (2017) to define good ( 10 ppts), adequate ( ≤ ≤ 15  ppts),  marginal ( ≤ 20 ppts) and inadequate ( ≤ 30  ppts)  self-assessment.  These  data  clearly  show  that  the  cumulative percentage of individuals with the lowest self-assessment errors (±8 ppts) increases with academic rank. Furthermore, these data indicate that 85.6% of experts, 73.1% of developing experts and 68.5% of novices self-assess within 17 ppts of objective measures of their competence. Similar trends are apparent from the distribution of errors among the different quartiles of science literacy (SLCI scores). About 30.6% of people in the lowest quartile of SLCI scores self-assessed within ± 8 ppts, whereas more than 67% of those in the highest quartile did so. These increase to nearly 54% and 87%, respectively, when we consider errors of less than ±17 ppts. Clearly, most people are aware of their knowledge and skills, and relatively few individuals exist with extreme selfassessment errors of &gt;30 ppts above or below their measured competence (Nuhfer et al. 2016b).

We  also  use  the  distributions  of  self-assessment  errors  to  explore  the consistency  of  self-assessments  across  different  measures.  Again,  to  avoid artefacts  resulting  from  differences  in  scale  and  floor-ceiling  effects,  it  is better to compare ranges rather than absolute values. In Figure 6.4, we plot the  distributions  of  individual  self-assessment  errors  (normalised  to  the standard deviation of self-assessment errors of the professor rank) derived from the predicted global measure by each individual's self-assessment error derived from the KSSLCI. More than 60% of those who registered the smallest

KSSLCI, Knowledge Survey of the Science Literacy Concept Inventory; SLCI, Science Literacy Concept Inventory. Note: Individuals who register the lowest self-assessment errors derived from the 25-item KSSLCI (0-1 standard deviations) also tend to register the lowest self-assessment errors using the single-item, predicted global measure. The reverse is true for those individuals who register a large self-assessment error with the KSSLCI.

self-assessment errors ( ≤ 1 standard deviation) using the more informed and granular  KSSLCI  also  had  the  smallest  self-assessment  errors  using  the predicted global measure (Figure 6.4). Because predicted self-assessments of competence are less informed, they rely more on affect (e.g. Sitzmann et al. 2010). The proportion of individuals with large self-assessment errors from the predicted  global measure  also  increases  among  those  with  increasing self-assessment errors from the KSSLCI. All participants completed the singleitem, predicted global self-estimate before encountering the 25 items on the KSSLCI, so this relationship strongly supports the notion that self-assessment, whether of global or granular nature, is a generally developed skill. Comparisons of self-assessment errors from the granular KSSLCI with the postdicted global measure  yield  similar  results.  People  with  more  accurate  self-assessment seem to demonstrate it more consistently (see also Nuhfer et al. 2017).

An approach for investigating self-assessment advocated by Nuhfer et al. (2016b, 2017) and Watson et al. (2019) was involved using correlation plots. These  researchers  correlated  the  mean  scores  of  individual  items  from  an objective measure with their corresponding mean self-assessed ratings from the  same  items.  Doing  so  attenuated  the  random  noise  that  abounds  in individual  human  self-assessments.  The  grouping  categories  that  facilitate

Slopes defined by the data are at least partly the result of numeracy artefacts (floor-ceiling effects). See text for details.

focused research are numerous, but examples include each of the 25 items in the SLCI, demographic groups, individual classes, class ranks or institutions. This  graphical  approach  permits  comparing  groups  with  a  wide  range  of scores  and  avoids  employing  graphs  that  produce  numerical  artefacts. Figure 6.5 reveals the SLCI scores and KSSLCI ratings for the 25 items for each quartile of measured competence, as determined by the SLCI score. The data points spread in each plot reflect the individual items' relative difficulty in the KSSLCI and SLCI. In these plots, perfect self-assessment would produce bestfit lines with slope = 1, and R 2 = 1. Note that for those in the first quartile, the objective and self-assessed measures of the 25 items in the SLCI have a slope of  0.24  and R 2 =  0.30.  The  slope  and R 2 values  increase  in  the  successive quartiles of greater science literacy, reaching a maximum of 0.57 and 0.70,

respectively, in the fourth quartile. Correlation plots by academic rank indicate similar increases in both slope (0.37 to 0.51) and R 2 (0.51 to 0.69) from novices to experts. These results suggest that greater domain knowledge (quartile of SLCI  scores)  and  improved  intellectual  development  (e.g.  Perry  1999) contribute  together  to  develop  the  capacity  for  self-assessment  accuracy. These  plots  also  confirm  that  people  are  generally  aware  of  what  their competence is, even when they have relative inexperience in a knowledge domain (Nuhfer et al. 2016b, 2017; Watson et al. 2019).

## Self-assessments by historically underrepresented groups in STEM

The preceding discussions indicate that self-assessment skill correlates with educational  background  (academic  rank),  interest  and  experience  in  the domain (a major, or intent to major in science) and demonstrates knowledge in the domain (SLCI scores). However, realise that 'educational background' refers to the standard educational approach in which self-assessment skill is rarely taught as an explicit learning objective. In the present system, improved skill  in  self-assessment  likely  occurs  as  a  collateral  effect  rather  than  the product of intentional efforts. Next, we address socioeconomic variables.

Several studies using knowledge survey data (Nuhfer et al. 2016b, 2017; Watson et al. 2019; Wirth et al. 2016) reported negative impacts on objective test  scores  and  self-assessed  ratings  of  science  literacy  resulting  from  the effects  of  lesser  privilege.  Reduced  privilege  disproportionately  falls  on underrepresented populations (e.g. female students, racial and ethnic minorities, first-generation students and English second language speakers). However, few studies have investigated these demographic variables independent  of  potential  interactions  by  the  other  variables.  Given  the mounting  evidence  of  significant  differences  in  self-assessment  with  an increasing number of variables, the availability of larger paired-measures data sets permits us to extend the examination of the impacts of socioeconomic variables on self-assessment.

Several studies reported lower self-confidence among female populations and their tendency to underestimate their competence relative to objective measures of their competence in those domains (Herbst 2020; Perez-Felkner, Nix &amp; Thomas 2017; Sakellariou 2020). However, if other demographic variables also affect  self-assessment,  and  if  the  binary  genders  have  unequal  distributions across  groups,  then  the  correlations  that  consider  only  gender  differences become tenuous. To isolate the effects of gender on self-assessment while controlling for floor-ceiling effects, we selected only those participants with SLCI scores in the highest quartile and majority group of our binary race and ethnicity  variable.  We  then  compared  the  self-assessment  errors  of  male

respondents and female respondents with and without an interest in science from each academic rank (Figure 6.6). Perhaps most notable is the observation that self-assessment errors are increasingly significant and negative for those without a science commitment. This observation held for both binary genders within  all  academic  ranks.  We  interpret  this  relationship  to  confirm  the importance  of  knowledge  and  experience  in  the  STEM  domain  to  making accurate  self-assessments  (e.g.  Falchikov  &amp;  Boud  1989;  Nietfeld  &amp;  Schraw 2002). The more negative self-assessment errors registered by non-science female respondents might result from that population's responding differently to certain items on the SLCI that exhibit bias or could also result from some gender bias in the overall SLCI instrument, as suggested by recent IRT analysis

KSSLCI, Knowledge Survey of the Science Literacy Concept Inventory; SLCI, Science Literacy Concept Inventory. Note: The median self-assessment ratings of female respondents are consistently lower than those of men and that the median self-assessments by those with science interest are significantly more accurate.

FIGURE 6.6: (a &amp; b) Bar graphs of self-assessment errors (derived from the KSSLCI) for those in the majority category of the binary ethnicity variable and in the highest quartile of SLCI scores. The median selfassessment errors are shown for female (blue shading) and male (red shading) respondents in each category of academic rank ( x -axis) and science interest (row panels).

(Walter et al. 2021). The magnitudes of the self-assessment errors decrease with increasing rank, for those both with and without an interest in science, suggesting that educational experience contributes to improved  selfassessment independent of domain expertise.

In summary, female respondents consistently register more negative selfassessment errors compared with equivalent male populations (Figure 6.6). Most  notably,  significant  negative  self-assessment  errors  persist  among female  participants,  even  at  the  highest  academic  rank  (professor)  in  the sciences (Figure 6.6). This approach allowed us to control for five out of the seven most significant demographic variables that we have identified thus far and strongly support the notion that female respondents tend to self-assess their competence at lower levels than they can demonstrate. Remarkably, in all combinations of variables that we have plotted, female respondents rarely have larger self-assessment errors than male respondents.

Using a similar approach, we also investigated the relationships between ethnic  minorities  and  first-generation  status  on  self-assessment.  For  this analysis, we selected participants from the rank of developing experts (3rdand 4th-year students), the largest group in our database and from the highest quartile of SLCI scores to control for floor-ceiling effects. Comparing binary gender categories by underrepresented minority and first-generation status, we  again  observe  that  our  sample  of  female  students  consistently  underestimates their demonstrable competence relative to male students (Figure 6.7). The relationships exhibited by this plot also suggest larger and more  negative  self-assessment  errors  for  those  in  our  binary  racial/ethnic minority and first-generation college student categories. Because the number of  students  in  our  racial/ethnic  minority  and  first-generation  categories  is relatively small (Table 6.1), further analyses controlling for other variables are not yet possible.

In our modest study sample, the results are remarkably consistent over a wide range of combinations of variables - those who are racial/ethnic minorities or first-generation college students consistently self-assess themselves below objective measures of their competence. Extended analyses of these and other variables await a larger database with a more diverse sample. Indeed, a more accurate and nuanced understanding of self-assessment has recently emerged. The findings contradict a large block of literature in the behavioural sciences that  began  with  Kruger  and  Dunning  (1999),  which  underestimates  most people's self-awareness and ability to accurately self-assess their competence. Nuhfer et al. (2016a, 2017) explained how these underestimations became the accepted consensus and offer strong evidence that the inferred accuracies of self-assessments depend on the quality of the measures. High-quality measures reveal  that  self-assessment  ratings  also  vary  with  privilege  and  intellectual development.  Broad  generalisations  about  self-assessment  across  diverse populations risk being oversimplified.

Note: The median self-assessment ratings of female students are consistently more underconfident than those of male students and that the median self-assessments by historically underrepresented minority groups in the categories of ethnicity and firstgeneration students have consistently lower median self-assessment ratings.

## Unjustified underconfidence and overconfidence

Another  unique  approach  we  employ  here  to  characterise  groups'  selfassessments  involves  focusing  on  people's  tendencies  to  under-  or  overestimate  their  abilities.  Paired  measures  that  use  knowledge  surveys  as  a source  of self-assessment ratings allow for estimating the degree  of underconfidence  or  overconfidence.  When  participants  complete  the  selfassessment of their science literacy (KSSLCI), they self-assess their understanding of each science literacy item by using three psychometrically sound,  distinct and  efficient response  options.  In  contrast,  participant responses  to  the  aligned  objective  measures  of  science  literacy  (SLCI) generate a binary scoring system ('correct' or 'incorrect'). When participants

answer an item correctly on the SLCI, their response option to that same item on  the  KSSLCI  offers  insights  into  participants'  self-assessment  accuracy and confidence. For correctly answered items on the SLCI, we should expect that accurate self-assessors would more frequently select response options indicating some level of knowledge (e.g. partial or full understanding of the item). When participants choose 'not yet able to address the item' but answer it  correctly,  this  offers  an  opportunity  for  study.  For  each  individual,  we calculated the proportion of items with correct responses on the SLCI that received the least confident response option ('not yet able to address the item')  on  the  KSSLCI,  and  we  refer  to  the  paired  measures  exhibiting  this relationship as characterising 'unjustified underconfidence'. We first verified that more such responses occurred than should occur by random chance.

We  proclaimed  such  paired  responses  as 'unjustified' because  the magnitude of the under-estimates seemed unwarranted after comparisons with the correct answers registered by those same individuals on the SLCI. We can also use the complimentary relationship (i.e. the proportion of items with incorrect responses on the SLCI that received the most confident response option on the KSSLCI) to calculate a measure of 'unjustified overconfidence'.

In Figure 6.8, we consider unjustified underconfidence among those with a commitment  to  science  by  gender,  academic  rank  and  the  binary  ethnic minority  category.  This  bar  graph  shows  that  female  students  consistently register  greater  median  levels  of  unjustified  underconfidence  across  all demographic groups. Thus, female respondents self-assessed at the lowest level of competence ('not yet able to address this item') more often than did men when they demonstrated that they knew the correct response option on the SLCI. The plot reveals that unjustified underconfidence decreases for both female and male students with increasing academic rank. Once again, this confirms that self-assessment accuracy improves with expertise (e.g. educational experience and domain knowledge). This plot reveals generally increased  levels of unjustified underconfidence  among  those  who  are historically underrepresented in STEM, relative to those from majority ethnic groups. It also supports the genuine relationship between underconfidence and students of lesser privilege, as noted by Watson et al. (2019).

Comparing response options on self-assessment measures across correct or  incorrect  items  from  objective  measures  avoids  the  numerical  artefacts (e.g. floor and ceiling effects) inherent to other commonly used approaches in self-assessment (e.g. use of quartiles and difference scores consisting of selfassessment  and  objective  measures).  Still,  for  those  with  the  lowest  and highest objective measures of science literacy, we recognise that one potential limitation of this approach lies in the limited number of correct and incorrect SLCI responses available to calculate measures.

Many researchers have emphasised the long-term impacts of beliefs about self on important career decisions (e.g. Correll 2001). Representative belief

Female respondents consistently indicate greater underconfidence in all categories by rank and ethnic minority/majority. Participants in the higher developing expert category and majority binary ethnic category register lower unjustified underconfidence. See text for explanation.

systems include stereotype threats (Spencer, Steele &amp; Quinn 1999; Steele 1997; Steele  &amp;  Aronson  1995)  and  growth  mindsets  (Dweck  1999).  Given  the multitude  of  daily  self-assessments  and  decisions  required  to  become  a scientist (e.g. 'Can I complete that homework problem?' 'Will I be successful in that  course  if  I  take  it?'  'Am  I  good  enough  to  declare  a  major  in  science, technology, engineering or mathematics?' 'Am I smart enough to get into a good graduate programme?' 'Will I be competitive enough to secure funding for my research career?'), it is no small wonder that even slight differences in tendencies to overestimate or underestimate competence can have enormous consequences  on  important  life  decisions  (e.g.  Ehrlinger  &amp;  Dunning  2003; Schulz &amp; Thöni 2016; Sheldrake et al. 2015). We agree with Nix et al. (2015) and Perez-Felkner  et  al.  (2017),  who  emphasised  the  importance  of  gendered ability beliefs on making decisions to engage with advanced coursework and

pursue degrees in STEM fields at several critical stages during late secondary school and early college. Moreover, this work suggests that the magnitudes and signs of errors in self-estimated competence change with other variables (e.g.  academic  rank,  measured  competence  and  socioeconomic  variables). Our results reveal the complexity of determining whether the underconfident groups or the overconfident groups most merit intervention. By strengthening the capacity for accurate self-assessment and developing self-regulation in students,  educators  can  mitigate  damage  caused  by  overconfidence  and underconfidence across all demographic groups. Learning environments in which ALL students practice self-assessment and then discuss misalignments can create equitable and inclusive classrooms.

## Promoting self-directed learning with knowledge surveys and self-assessment

The knowledge survey's design and format make it useful to a wide range of purposes and environments in teaching and learning. The process begins with the teacher writing knowledge survey items that are directly assessable and closely align with the learning objectives for a unit of learning or an experience. Individual  knowledge  survey  items  describe,  at  a  granular  level,  the  target knowledge or skill, the desired level of understanding and the context. They supply the blueprint to the scaffolding to using content - content in ANY discipline - to realise higher-order thinking. The knowledge survey prompts or the response options should contain some variant of the root 'I can…'. This reminds  the  respondent  that  affect  and  awareness  of  self  are  part  of  the response to any cognitive challenge. Responding to 'self' reveals whether the respondent  can  complete  the  described  task  at  this  time.  Students  can complete the surveys in the classroom using pencil and paper or outside the traditional  classroom  using  a  wide  range  of  digital  platforms  (e.g.  Google Forms and learning management systems). We prefer that students do the completions outside, where constraints do not distract attention from selfreflection to 'covering the survey' by attending to a clock rather than to the queries. The knowledge survey design also facilitates efficient administration before and after a short unit of learning such as in a workshop or at multiple points throughout an extended programme of study. Because respondents only  respond  with  their  perceived  ability  to  address  a  task  at  that  time, knowledge  survey  prompts  are  appropriate  for  learning  objectives  that address  both  knowledge  and  skills.  programme  leaders  can  administer knowledge surveys efficiently and effectively in settings where more traditional tests  are  inappropriate  or  logistically  difficult  (e.g.  co-curricular  activities, internships, leadership programmes and research experiences).

Many teachers utilise knowledge surveys for pre-post learning assessments for  courses  or  smaller  learning  units  in  other  contexts  (e.g.  workshops, conferences,  research  experiences  and  internships).  In  this  mode  of  use,

learners interact with the survey items at the beginning and/or end of a unit of  learning,  and  the  primary  goal  of  student  self-assessment  is  to  guide teaching.  Student  responses  to  a  pre-course  knowledge  survey  provide information about students' background knowledge that can inform course and instructional design. A teacher can also use pre-course survey data to establish a baseline for evaluating learning gains at the end of a learning unit. When administered over multiple iterations of a course, knowledge surveys also provide an efficient way for teachers to evaluate the impacts of course organisation or instructional design changes. Some teachers who realise the awareness  they  are  achieving  in  constructing  a  knowledge  survey  soon recognise that teaching students how to construct knowledge survey items imparts the same benefits. Constructing knowledge surveys helps teachers be more metacognitive about their teaching to carefully consider the goals for learning,  the  targeted  levels  of  mastery  and  the  alignment  of  assessments with learning goals (Cohen 1987). Instructors can guide students to own these same benefits too. Students can start by replacing the teacher's knowledge survey items with their own and then progress to designing their own battery of items that scaffold their learning to the desired goal.

In addition to serving as a pre-post learning survey, some teachers also use knowledge surveys to support student learning of the content and skill objectives in  a  course  (e.g.  Harris  &amp;  Watson  2021).  Instructors  share  knowledge  survey items with students to communicate course goals and expectations for learning more clearly and in greater detail. Students can also refer to the relevant items in a knowledge survey before beginning a reading assignment. In this practice, the  knowledge  survey  serves  as  a  guide  to  focus  on  student  learning  while reading or conducting an activity. Using self-assessments to clarify expectations, especially for 1st-year and  underserved  students,  improves  the  learning experience,  helps  students  develop  as  self-directing  learners  and  improves student success and retention (Mahlberg 2015; Nicol 2009; Yorke 2005).

Students can informally use the survey items to self-assess their mastery of the learning objectives at the end of a reading assignment or teaching activity. Alternatively, teachers can direct students to use the survey items to guide their study before an exam. In a more formal version of this approach, teachers can offer students the opportunity to complete a pencil-and-paper or online self-assessment  of  their  learning  using  a  knowledge  survey  to  gauge  their readiness to complete a summative assessment (e.g. quizzes or exams) in a course. Typically, teachers do not grade knowledge survey responses, but to encourage participation, teachers can treat knowledge surveys as assignments and award credit for their completion. At this level of usage, knowledge survey data inform teaching practices, but students also use them to facilitate their learning of course content and skills.

In addition to supporting student learning of a course's content and skill objectives,  some  teachers  also  use  knowledge  surveys  to  foster  student

learning about metacognition, self-regulation and SDL. When teachers include similar items  on  both  knowledge  surveys  and  summative  assessments (e.g.  quizzes  or  tests),  students  and  teachers  can  compare  student  selfassessments  with  those  from  direct  measures  of  competence.  Another approach is for the teacher to encourage students to compare the formative self-assessment results with those of the summative assessment. Alternatively, students can complete a structured reflection (e.g. post-exam reflection or exam wrapper;  Achacoso  2004)  that  guides  them  to  reflect  on  their  selfassessed readiness to meet a summative assessment. This reflection informs study strategies, time management and analyses of exam performance. The analysis can include careful evaluation of their performance at different Bloom levels  of  understanding, an essential design element of knowledge surveys (e.g. Favazzo et al. 2014). Instructors can also encourage students to outline plans  for  improvement,  including  how  they  can  better  plan  for  the  next summative assessment. These self-assessment activities promote students' affect and metacognitive knowledge (e.g. McMillan &amp; Hearn 2008; Ross 2006), which in turn supports their development as self-regulating (Black &amp; Wiliam 1998; Panadero, Andrade &amp; Brookhart 2018) and self-directing learners (e.g. eds. Mentz, De Beer &amp; Bailey 2019).

Students  can  also  be  directly  involved  in  generating  knowledge  survey items. Instructors can guide students in identifying learning objectives (both knowledge and skill) from readings and other course materials. Following an introduction to Bloom's taxonomy (Anderson &amp; Krathwohl 2001) and Perry's stages  of  intellectual  development  (Perry  1999),  students  can  begin  to comprehend the differences in thinking characteristics demanded for different learning  objectives.  Working  in  small  groups,  they  can  develop  knowledge survey items addressing the material at varying Bloom levels aligned with the course level. This activity fosters engagement and an improved understanding of the relationship between self-assessment and learning. Later, teachers can guide  students  through  reviews  of  the  survey  results  leading  to  improved student interest and engagement. Students seem to develop curiosity about understanding  how  differences  in  self-assessment  relate  to  socioeconomic variables and privilege. They appreciate discussing how these findings inform the experiences many students have in college (Fleisher 2019). Instructors can combine the topic of self-assessment with discussions of standards, criteria, the design of rubrics and self-evaluation. These approaches bring the goals of learning into sharper focus. They help develop a common language understood by both teachers and students and encourage students to assume greater responsibility and agency in the learning process.

Finally, we  note  that  the  pedagogical  shifts  produced  from  varied applications of knowledge surveys and purposeful self-assessment occur best through  close  teacher  involvement  (e.g.  Brown  &amp;  Harris  2013).  Instructors providing learning activities about self-assessment, self-regulation and SDL help students understand how to scaffold their learning and development.

## Self-assessment measures and instruments

The self-assessed measures of competence derived from three self-assessment measures correlate well with our objective measure of competence ( predicted global self-assessment, r s =  0.32;  KSSLCI, r s =  0.62; postdicted global selfassessment, r s = 0.62; Table 6.2), consistent with our earlier findings (Nuhfer et al. 2016b). This pattern reveals the importance of communication in selfassessment, especially the requirement that students must understand what they  are  being  asked  to  self-assess.  A  broad,  general  description  of  the challenge (e.g. a predicted global self-assessment) is almost always insufficient, and there is evidence that feeling of knowing and confidence judgements may have different psychological bases (e.g. beliefs vs. retrieval cues, respectively; Costermans,  Lories  &amp;  Ansay  1992;  Perfect  &amp;  Hollins  1996).  Additional opportunities  for  retrieval  practice  (e.g.  Miller  &amp;  Geraci  2014)  might  also contribute  to  the  apparent  improved  metacognitive  accuracies  of  selfestimates from our postdicted global measure.

The participants studied in this chapter took the survey in one sitting and experienced no teaching of the content. The disclosure provided by merely interacting  with  the  knowledge  survey  produced  learning  by  clarifying  the nature of the coming challenge. After engaging with the knowledge survey, the participants' self-assessment accuracy improved significantly. This increased understanding persisted through confronting the actual challenge. This indicates that engaging with a course knowledge survey better prepares students for learning course content by clarifying the nature of the challenges ahead. When teaching follows this understanding, it will almost certainly be more successful than the teaching that falls on no such heightened awareness. People adjust their  self-assessments  as  their  understanding  of  the  domain increases (Nuhfer et al. 2017; Watson et al. 2019).

After completing several published studies with these different kinds of selfassessments, we realised that the postdicted global self-assessment following taking the SLCI is almost as revealing as that obtained by taking the full granular knowledge  survey.  Inclusion  of  the  25-item  KSSLCI  adds  20  to  30  min  to completing  the  daisy-chained  instrument;  the  final postdicted  global selfassessment adds about 10 to 20 s. So, the version of the SLCI in use for routine assessments since 2018 now carries a predicted global self-assessed competence rating  at  the  beginning  and  a postdicted  global self-assessed  competence rating at the end (post-SLCI). The full KSSLCI served its purpose by revealing that knowledge surveys capture self-assessments that relate strongly to the mastery of the content addressed by the instrument. It is no longer necessary to run it together with the SLCI to obtain useful assessment information.

A  lesson  emerges  from  all  of  this  research:  if  adding  a predicted and postdicted  global self-assessment  query  adds  only  seconds  of  test-taking time for participants, why not incorporate these global self-assessments on

every  scored  faculty-made  test,  quiz  and  assignment?  Doing  so  provides students with practice in doing self-assessment and enables later feedback to polish  their  accuracy.  Further,  it  gives  faculty  the  benefit  of  receiving  selfassessment  information  together  with  test  scores  of  cognitive  content mastery. These paired measures give us much more valuable insights about students and learning than can test scores alone.

## Knowledge surveys and typologies of selfassessment

The  knowledge  survey  examples  described  above  reveal  formative  and summative applications for improving teaching, content learning and SDL in teacher- and learner-centred environments. In many respects, the design of knowledge  surveys  makes  them  ideally  suited  as  both  a  measure  of  selfassessment and as an intervention for improving it. In other words, an accurate characterisation  of  the  role  of  knowledge  surveys  in  supporting  learning depends less on the measure (it remains unchanged) and more on the intended use. This approach ('measurement + intervention'), described as the 'third wave' in the history of self-assessment by Panadero, Klug and Järvelä (2016c), serves for improving student monitoring and SRL.

Most existing typologies do not fully capture the nuances of self-assessment practices offered by knowledge surveys. We suggest that a typology of selfassessment could include elements of the agents, contexts and goals of selfassessment. Table 6.4 summarises the examples of knowledge survey uses (e.g.  classroom  pre-  and  post-assessment,  learner  reading/study  guides, learner  pre-test  self-assessments,  learner  post-test  analysis  and  learnergenerated surveys) described in the preceding section. The examples listed from left to right in Table 6.4 define a continuum from teaching-centred to learning-centred. In this continuum, a pedagogical shift occurs from a focus purely  on  disciplinary  learning  towards  an  emphasis  on  developing  the knowledge  and  skills  required  for  self-regulated  and  SDL.  The  table  also represents  several  self-assessment  typologies  summarised  by  Panadero, Brown and Strijbos (2016a) and the classifications articulated by each typology as applied to the different uses of knowledge surveys.

When employed to develop the 'knowledge interests' of Boud and Brew (1995),  knowledge  surveys  can  address  the  full  range  of  interests  from technical to communicative and emancipatory (T able  6.4).  In  the  teachingcentred  uses,  which  include  research  conducted  with  a  general  goal  of improving teaching and learning,  knowledge  survey  creation  and  administration are under full control of the teacher, and the primary goal of self-assessment is improving teaching (and indirectly learning). At the learning-centred levels of knowledge survey use, the teacher and students use knowledge surveys to support  the  learning  of  disciplinary  content  to  serve  both technical and

communicative interests.  Finally,  when  used  for  improving  SDL,  students assume greater responsibility in using knowledge surveys. The focus of selfassessment shifts towards promoting the development of metacognition, SRL and agency (Boud and Brew's 'emancipatory interests').

The  typology  of  self-assessment  proposed  by  Tan  (2001)  emphasises teacher involvement. In the example of teaching-centred knowledge survey use, students assess their thinking processes ( self-awareness category), but they do so without consistent criteria or comparison with external standards (Table 6.4). At the middle levels of learning-centred self-assessment, students engage  in  self-assessments  ( self-appraisals) with  increasing  awareness  of teacher expectations without formal comparison to external standards. At the SDL-centred levels of knowledge survey uses, classified as self-assessment practice and self-determined assessment ,  students compare self- and teachers' assessments and assume greater responsibility for determining what and how to  self-assess.  The  example  knowledge  survey  applications  described  in Table 6.4 address two intermediate to high level categories ( standard model and self-assessment  with  integrated  feedback) of  the  power  balance  and transparency typology of Taras (2010).

According  to  the  typology  of  Alonso-Tapia  and  Panadero  (2010)  and Panadero,  Alonso-Tapia  and  Reche  (2013),  all  example  uses  of  knowledge surveys would be classified as standard self-assessment .  However, components of rubrics (e.g. criteria and standards) are involved in the highest level of SDLcentred  knowledge  surveys  (Table  6.4).  Under  the  classification  of  selfassessment  formats  by  Brown  and  Harris  (2013),  the  different  knowledge survey  applications  span  the  range  from self-ratings to self-estimates and criteriaor rubric-based  assessments .  Andrade  (2019),  who  responded  to Panadero  et  al.'s  (2016c)  call  for  a  more  comprehensive  typology  of  selfassessment, proposed a typology based on the what , why and how of selfassessment. By this typology, knowledge surveys function across a range of categories  from formative , task-specific  ratings to summative,  post-task judgements and process-oriented formats with standards (Table 6.4).

In  summary,  it  is  informative  to  examine  knowledge  survey  uses  in  the context of several recent typologies of self-assessment. Given the singular design and form of knowledge surveys, it is somewhat remarkable that they function across such a wide range of categories that represent such different criteria and approaches. The comparison with existing typologies highlights additional dimensions for consideration in the classification of self-assessment practices.  Essential  elements  in  the  use  of  knowledge  surveys  include  the agent  (teacher,  student),  the  context  (e.g.  self-assessment  measure  and learning intervention) and the purposes (e.g. improving teaching and learning, content learning, or SRL and SDL).

For  us,  the  most  critical  differences  in  the  self-assessment  approach accompany  shifts  from  teacher-directed  uses  for  improving  teaching  to student-guided uses for deeper content learning and after that to studentmanaged uses for the more holistic development of SRL and agency. We also recognise  that  the  different  uses  of  knowledge  surveys  reflected  in  this continuum  could  serve  as  microcosms  for  the  courses  that  employ  the instrument. In summary, the effective implementation of knowledge surveys to support deeper forms of student self-assessment and development also requires a developing pedagogical awareness of needed transformations at the scales of teaching, courses and curricula.

## Limitations

The results of this study, as with most studies, prove to have some limitations. Although our results suggest that self-assessment accuracy correlates with academic rank, commitment to science and demonstrated science literacy, we have not undertaken studies of causation. The SLCI-KSSLCI national database includes some pre- and post-course survey data, but our analyses are crosssectional.  That  is,  the  data  from  each  survey  respondent  are  considered  a snapshot  of  unique  individual's  self-assessment  in  the  context  of  a  single course. As such, our study design does not track individual changes in selfassessment skill or dispositions through a curriculum or degree programme. Apparent improvements in self-assessment skill with increasing educational background and disciplinary knowledge could result, at least in part,  from biases in our sample.

Our ability to more rigorously evaluate the impacts of several demographic variables on self-assessment is also limited by our sample. The national SLCIKSSLCI  database  contains  relatively  small  numbers  of  respondents  from underrepresented minorities (e.g. ethnic, racial, gender and sexual identity, and first generation), so our conclusions about differences in self-assessment skill  should  be  regarded  as  exploratory.  Furthermore,  the  way  in  which instructors volunteer to have their courses participate in the study, and the ways in which students in those courses respond to the surveys are completely voluntary. This means that we cannot ensure a sample that is representative of the HE population. However, we do not attempt to make generalisations that  are  not  bound  by  the  sample  and  demography  of  this  investigation. Further studies that mitigate these limitations and include a larger sample in terms of demography will be considered.

The design of the study, with an emphasis on citizen-level understanding of science concepts, also means that surveys are completed under a wide range of conditions and settings. As such, we have little control over the conditions and  effort  of  the  respondents.  In  some  cases,  course  instructors  award students with extra credit and feedback (not a letter grade) for completing

the surveys, so some students may not have been sufficiently motivated to employ their  best  self-assessment  skills  when  completing  the  surveys.  We have  tried  to  mitigate  this  limitation  by  culling  patterned  responses  (i.e. random guesses) that likely do not reflect intentional self-assessment.

Statistical analyses of self-assessment have previously been fraught with challenges, and we have attempted to address some of those challenges in this  chapter.  Certain  comparisons  of  individuals  with  widely  differing  selfassessment  skills,  calculated  as  the  difference  between  demonstrated  and self-assessed knowledge, yield numerical artefacts interpreted as a DunningKruger effect. To minimise these artefacts, we focus our comparisons on data from individuals with similarly demonstrated competencies. Of course, this has  the  unintended  consequence  of  greatly  reducing  our  sample  size  and introduces noise into our comparisons of different demographic groups.

Finally, the generalisability of the results of this study is limited by biases in the study population and by the limits of the knowledge domain. Respondents to the SLCI and KSSLCI surveys are mostly from university settings, so strictly speaking, our results are relevant to students and faculty in HE. Although we are quite confident that our conclusions about the fallacies inherent in the methods of analyses of some prior studies of self-assessment, we are less certain  about  the  generalisability  of  our  conclusions  to  other  knowledge domains. Because the SLCI and KSSLCI surveys specifically target knowledge in the science domain, we have not studied how self-assessment accuracy or dispositions  might  differ  in  other  content  domains.  Finally,  our  analysis  of knowledge survey data thus far has been largely limited to the United States, so generalisability of the results to different cultures and educational systems in  other  countries  awaits  broader  implementation.  With  the  use  of  selfassessment (e.g. knowledge surveys) taking rise in countries such as South Africa, further investigations which include these contexts are considered.

## Conclusion

We began this chapter with four goals:

- 1. Use  a  database  obtained  from  4-year  institutions  and  demonstrate previously  unreported  ways  to  extract  information  from  the  paired measures of self-assessed competence ratings obtained from knowledge surveys and actual competence scores from a validated concept inventory.
- 2.  Explore  the  results  obtained  by  applying  these  methods  to  diverse demographic groups.
- 3.  Describe current applications of knowledge surveys for supporting learning, teaching and research.
- 4.  Summarise how knowledge surveys exemplify the spectrum of teaching and learning expressed in recent typologies of self-assessment.

For this study, we collected a unique database of paired measures collected with high-quality instruments, and we used it to illustrate different ways of analysing and presenting self-assessment data, including comparisons of the distributions  of  self-assessment  errors,  item-by-item  correlations  of  selfestimated and objective measures, detailed comparisons of subgroups and analyses of the degree of mis-estimated competence for correct or incorrect items on objective measures. Using these analytical approaches, we observed consistent patterns of self-assessment suggesting that meaningful differences in self-assessment exist within different socioeconomic groups. We describe how teachers proficient in using knowledge surveys employ them to promote active  learning  of  content  and  to  mentor  students  towards  self-regulation, higher-order  thinking  and  SDL.  We  also  brought  together  two  previously separate  tracks  of  research  and  mapped  established  uses  of  knowledge surveys across several distinct typologies of self-assessment.

Extensive data now establish knowledge surveys as ideally suited as both an intervention for improving learning and as an instrument for measuring learning and self-assessment. Knowledge surveys are readily adapted to offer efficient and reliable support for a wide range of self-assessment purposes (e.g.  learning,  teaching  and  research)  across  varied  learning  environments (e.g.  classrooms,  online,  programs,  workshops,  internships  and  research experiences). Finally, to ensure that ALL students develop as self-directing learners,  self-assessment  should  be  an  explicit  learning  objective  in  our courses and curricula. Knowledge surveys are ideally suited for supporting students as they progress along the pathways to SDL.

For this  chapter,  we  employed  extensive  data  generated  from  validated and  aligned  instruments  to  confirm  that  developing  students'  capacity  for self-assessment accuracy is essential to their becoming truly educated and self-directing  learners.  We  argue  that  knowledge  surveys  are  perhaps  the most versatile instrument for developing such capacity. In constructing this chapter, we met four goals: (1) demonstrated ways to extract information from comparisons of self-assessed  and  demonstrated  competence  from  aligned instruments, (2) showed the value of applying these methods to understand diverse demographic groups, (3) presented the utility of knowledge surveys for  supporting  learning,  teaching  and  research,  and  (4)  summarised  how knowledge surveys promote the outcomes articulated in typologies of selfassessment.

We can no longer ignore the vital role of self-assessment in innumerable decisions that students confront about learning, problem-solving, educational plans and career paths. The knowledge we present obligates educators to equip all students with the self-assessment skills needed for lifelong learning, careers and successful engagement with a rapidly changing world.

## Abstract

This chapter provides empirical research findings on an in-service professional development programme in which 10 natural sciences teachers from  Ikageng  and  Promosa  schools  in  the  Potchefstroom  district,  North West province, South Africa, participated. The leitmotif underpinning this research  was  that  teachers  should  take  ownership  of  their  learning  (as

intended  by  the  professional  development  programme)  as  self-directed learners. Based on teachers' needs, a professional development programme was developed to assist teachers in their learning and professional growth. The  2-year-long  intervention  was  guided  by  SDL  principles,  and  the researchers (who were also the facilitators) wanted to see teachers being active  agents  in  the  planning  of  the  learning  activities.  Teachers  had  to formulate  their  personal  learning  goals,  in  terms  of  four  dimensions  or domains, namely (1) classroom pedagogy and interaction (which included subject knowledge), (2) practical work and inquiry approaches in the science laboratory, (3) science-and-society perspectives (which included indigenous knowledge  to contextualise curriculum themes) and (4) assessment practices.  Based  on  these  learning  goals,  the  teachers  and  facilitators worked in tandem to design a teacher professional development programme that  would  facilitate  the  teachers'  learning.  This  mixed-methods  research utilised the Self-Directed Learning Instrument (SDLI) of Cheng et al. (2010) to determine whether the intervention influenced the teachers' SDL. Thirdgeneration Cultural-Historical Activity Theory was used as a research lens, in analysing the quantitative and qualitative data. A five-domain (dimensions) heuristic, that includes SDL as a fifth domain (dimension), is proposed, as this  would  ensure  teacher  agency  in  teacher  professional  development programmes.  These  teachers  engaged  in  diverse  learning  activities,  for example, a short learning programme on indigenous knowledge, a two-day immersion  laboratory  work  opportunity  at  the  African  Centre  for  DNA Barcoding  (to  develop  a  better  understanding  of  the  tenets  of  science); workshops  on  frugal  science  (science-on-a-shoestring),  where  teachers explored how low-cost materials could be used to foster inquiry learning in an under-resourced science classroom; a workshop on utilising information and communications technologies (ICTs) (such as the PhET simulations) in the science classroom; and general workshops on pedagogies and learning strategies, for example,  problem-based  and  cooperative  learning. To illustrate the learning of the teachers across the five domains, a profile of implementation was constructed for each of the 10 teachers. For this chapter, only one profile of implementation was analysed, to indicate how teacher professional  development  can  be  mapped  using  the  revised  Rogan  and Grayson (2003) profile of implementation.

## Introduction

For many years, countries in Africa have been performing dismally on global development indices (De Beer 2019; Oyelekan 2016). Amongst these countries is South Africa. South Africa is plagued by poor learner performance in science subjects (Sebotsa, De Beer &amp; Kriek 2018:268). This poor learner performance

is  also  shown  in  the  Southern  and  East  African  Consortium  for  Monitoring Educational  Quality  (SACMEQ)  (Spaull  2013).  As  an  indication  of  the seriousness of this problem, the South African educational system was ranked fourth last in the world by the Programme for International Student Assessment of  2011  (Monyooe  2017).  Major  issues  concerning  science  education  are teachers with a paucity of subject knowledge (Centre for Development and Enterprise [CDE] 2011), poor pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) (Kriek &amp; Grayson 2009; Mothwa 2011) and teachers 'trading' learner-centred inquiry learning  for  transmission-mode  teaching  because  of  systemic  pressures, despite  their  pedagogical  orientations  (Petersen,  Golightly  &amp;  Dudu  2019; Ramnarain &amp; Schuster 2014). A big problem highlighted by Voskamp, Kuiper and  Volman  (2020:3)  is  that  'teachers  often  take  over  a  large  part  of  the learning  process,  so  that  students  do  not  learn  how  to  direct  their  own learning'. Consequently, a specific aim of this research was to sensitise teachers to foster SDL in their classrooms.

An exigent strategy to address this formidable challenge remains teacher professional development (Sebotsa, De Beer &amp; Kriek 2019). However, many in-service  teacher  professional  development  programmes  (TPDP)  remain characterised  by  'top-down'  approaches  (Cronje  et  al.  2015;  Hoban  2002; Sebotsa et al. 2018). The programme designers and facilitators often decide on the learning content, pedagogies and assessment that would constitute the fabric of the programme (Sebotsa et al. 2018). Schlager and Fusco (2003) are of the view that this approach is tantamount to putting the 'cart before the horse'. As a case in point, the training of many teachers in South Africa during the introduction of the National Curriculum Statement consisted of 'one-shot'  workshops  (Hoban  2002)  that  failed  to  recognise  teachers'  real professional  development  needs  and  grassroots  challenges.  Most  of  the interventions  presented  to  the  teachers  did  not  adhere  to  the  desired objectives and outcomes of the curriculum (Kriek &amp; Basson 2008) and took a linear top-down approach (Kriek &amp; Basson 2008).

The top-down approach often occurs in three stages, namely, innovation arrival, teacher usage and teacher change. In the innovation arrival stage, the policymakers develop material and workshops, followed by presentations by facilitators; and it is assumed the teachers will arrive at the correct teacher use. The new content and skills presented are assumed to make sense to the teachers and enable application in the classroom. Further, it is assumed that the  'piecemeal'  approach  will  result  in  transformed  teaching  and  teacher change. According to Hoban (2002), Cronje (2015), Sebotsa et al. (2018), a top-down approach is a simplistic approach that assumes that brief workshops and  little  backup  support  will  provide  classroom  change.  This  simplistic approach often fails to lead to transformed teaching.

The  CDE  report  of  2011  avers  that  traditional  'one-shot'  approaches  to professional  development  could  be  seen  as  'piecemeal,  workshop-type development programmes which are not effective and are inadequate in the context of current educational reform efforts' (p. 22). To address this challenge in teacher education, Louws et al. (2017) stated that in-service TPDPs should be built around the real needs of teachers and that teachers should be active participants  in  such  professional  development.  These  authors,  therefore, advocate  for  SDL  as  the  foundation  for  TPDP.  Personal  autonomy  should characterise  such  programmes,  and  teachers  should  assume  ownership  of their learning (Garrison 1997).

In  this  chapter,  the  authors  provide  an  overview  of  a  TPDP  for  natural sciences teachers in Potchefstroom, North West province, South Africa, that used SDL as its point of departure. Self-directed learning can be defined as a process whereby the learner sets individual learning goals, identifies learning resources,  adopts  suitable  methods  and  evaluates  the  learning  process through critical reflection (Cazan &amp; Schiopca 2014; Knowles 1975).

The focus on SDL during the intervention served a dual purpose. Firstly, it served as a vehicle for teachers' individual learning. Secondly, it sensitised teachers to the affordances of SDL in their own classrooms. The researchers had  to  find  a  suitable  heuristic  to  map  teacher  professional  development, based on SDL principles, and decided on a profile of implementation, adapted from  Rogan  and  Grayson  (2003).  The  latter  authors  identified  four  subconstructs in their profile of implementation, which they called dimensions. In the context of the revised heuristic, we chose to speak of domains.

## Problem statement: Recurrent trepidations in South African science education amid COVID-19

Teachers as 'front liners' hold the responsibility to scaffold learning across the zone  of  proximal  development  (Vygotsky  1978)  in  the  classroom  setting. Research literature shows that - even prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, which brought about a stronger blended learning approach - inquiry learning and laboratory work were often marginalised (De Beer 2019). Thus, we argue that, in  a  post-COVID-19  world,  teacher  professional  development  is  even  more important. How can the true nature of science be communicated on an online platform? In addition to the new problems brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, for example, unequal access to online resources, science education in South Africa is also plagued with problems rooted in historical events. Some of these problems are:

- 1. Under-qualified  teachers  (CDE  2011),  which  impose  dire  constraints  on classroom interaction (Sebotsa 2020; Sebotsa et al. 2019).

- 2.  Lack  of  resources,  which  obfuscate  science  practical  work,  and  which prevent students' engagement with the nature of science.
- 3.  A western  and  decontextualised  curriculum  that  marginalises  many students,  disallowing  them  from  making  sense  of  science-and-society imperatives,  and  further  perpetuates  failures  to  address  the  affective domain in the science classroom.
- 4.  Lack of assessment methods that support student learning (Sebotsa et al. 2019).

Czerniewicz et al. (2020:7) reflected on education in the context of COVID-19 by stating that 'the impact of the pandemic has served as a painful reminder of all the inequalities that the system has managed to mask'. Blended learning can be incorporated with ease in some (more privileged) contexts, whereas it is much more difficult in historically disadvantaged contexts. The authors of this chapter are of the view that SDL will become increasingly important in a post-COVID-19 era, thus emphasising the importance of building TPDPs on SDL principles.

## Teacher professional development

In this section, we argue for the use of SDL as the sine qua non in TPDPs.

## Winds of change in teacher professional development programmes

The  National  Department  of  Education  promotes  teacher  development programmes  as  a  foundation  stone  for  improving  schooling  and  learner performance  (Carrim  2013).  A  similar  view  is  posed  by  the  South  African Council for Educators (SACE 2018:8) which stress that educators should 'keep abreast of educational trends and developments'. It remains an international imperative to professionally assist the teachers to develop the necessary skills and knowledge, such as PCK and content knowledge (CK), for the 21st-century educational  context  (Hardy  2012).  Van  Wyk  (2017:1)  claimed  that  'the emancipation  and  transformation  of  teacher  education  programmes  for  a quality education system needs creative and innovative strategies to empower teachers for the classroom of the future'.

Sebotsa et al. (2019:1) identified TPDP within a well-functioning community of  practice  metaphorically  as  the  'phoenix  that  will  rise  from  ashes'  and improve the state of science education in the country. The authors of this chapter acknowledge that many TPDPs fall short of assisting teachers with their real professional development needs (Sebotsa et al. 2018). Notwithstanding the significance of TPDPs in South Africa, challenges have been acknowledged in this system. Looking into the insights of Singh (2011),

many  TPDPs  remain  erratic,  failing  to  address  the  inability  of  teachers  to provide quality education. A factor that is under-researched in the field of TPDP is that of systemic programmes that are driven by the teachers and based on teachers own development needs.

Rogan and Grayson (2003) and Rogan and Aldous (2004) developed a profile of implementation that is useful in studying teachers' learning during a TPDP. These authors caution that implementation should consist of a series of small and manageable steps and that the context of the teachers' schools should be taken into consideration. However, their work did not give much prominence to SDL. Louws et al. (2017) made it clear that:

[ T ]eachers  show  great  ownership  when  directing  their  own  learning  in  the workplace, it is of interest to explore what teachers themselves choose as their learning goals, what kind of learning activities they choose to engage in, and what reasons teachers have for professional learning. (p. 172)

Other researchers, such as Kyndt et al. (2016) and Thomson and Turner (2013), agree with these sentiments, and the TPDP programme reported on in this chapter was built on these insights.

## Self-directed learning as the nuts and bolts of teacher professional development

Self-directed  learning  is  a  complex  construct,  and  researchers  highlight various aspects of importance, for example, that it is a process of autonomy of the learner (Harrison 1978); a personal attribute (Guglielmino 1977); and a moral,  emotional  and  intellectual  autonomy  (Candy  1991).  Self-directed learning  speaks  to  all  four  of  the  domains  (dimensions)  in  the  Rogan  and Grayson (2003) construct. For teachers to optimally develop knowledge and skills related to (1) classroom pedagogies, (2) practical work and the tenets of science,  (3)  science-and-society  approaches  that  foreground  the  affective domain, and (4) innovative assessment practices, we argue that SDL should underpin professional development programmes.

## Sebotsa et al. (2019) stated that:

[ ]n order to improve classroom interaction, develop practical work opportunities I embedded  in  inquiry  learning  (clearly  showing  the  science-and-society  link)  or engaging in innovative assessment, all require the teacher as a self-directed learner to: (1) set personal learning goals for themselves; (2) identify resources to achieve these learning goals (that could include other people, e.g., the more knowledgeable other); (3) decide upon relevant learning strategies; and (4) monitor and evaluate their own learning (Knowles 1975). (p. 358)

Critical reflection plays a big role in SDL (Thornton 2010), and this was the hallmark of the TPDP reported on in this chapter.

## Methodology and research question

The research question guiding this research was: How did Senior Phase natural sciences teachers' views of their own SDL change during a longitudinal and systemic professional development intervention? In this chapter, we present the research findings by mapping teachers' learning on the adapted profile of implementation.

## Developing a five-domain (dimension) profile of implementation

This  research  was  underpinned  by  pragmatism,  which  Merriam  and  Tisdell (2016:46) describe as an approach where 'multiple paradigms can be used to address research problems'. It was a mixed-methods research, which included qualitative  research  methods  (personal  and  focus  group  interviews  with teachers;  open-ended  questionnaires  such  as  the  views-of-the-nature-ofscience [Abd-El-Khalick, Bell &amp; Lederman 1998] and views-of-the-nature-ofindigenous-knowledge questionnaires  [Cronje,  De  Beer  &amp;  Ankiewicz  2015]; classroom observations, using the Reformed Teaching Observation Protocol [RTOP]  [Sawada  et  al.  2000])  and  quantitative  research,  using  the  SDLI (Cheng et al. 2010), in a pre- and post- intervention context.

It  is  imperative to provide context for the reader. During the mentioned intervention, the teachers engaged in diverse learning activities, for example, a 2-day short learning programme on indigenous knowledge, and teachers thereafter  submitted  portfolios  which  were  analysed.  The  teachers  also attended  a  2-day  immersion  laboratory  work  opportunity  at  the  African Centre for DNA Barcoding at the University of Johannesburg, and teachers completed  a  DNA  Barcoding  Questionnaire  which  aimed  to  assess  the teachers'  understanding  of  the  tenets  of  science.  The  DNA  Barcoding Questionnaire was developed by the researchers and was evaluated by experts in  the  field,  to  ensure  validity  and  credibility  of  the  instrument.  Similarly, experts were asked to critique the visible light test that teachers completed in a  pre-  and  post-intervention  fashion.  (One  of  the  problematic  areas  in  the curriculum  is  visible  light,  and  an  intervention  was  arranged  to  scaffold teachers' learning in this regard). The intervention also included workshops on  frugal  science  (science-on-a-shoestring),  where  teachers  explored  how low-cost  materials  could  be  used  to  foster  inquiry  learning  in  an  underresourced science classroom, and a workshop on utilising ICTs, such as the PhET simulations, in the science classroom. There were also a few general workshops  on  pedagogies  and  learning  strategies,  for  example,  problembased and cooperative learning. Ten natural sciences teachers from Ikageng and Promosa, suburbs of Potchefstroom, were selected through convenience

sampling to participate in this research, which took place over a period of two years. At the start of the programme, a needs analysis was done, and the teachers  were  active  participants  in  the  design  of  the  TPDP.  They  were requested to show a high level of ownership over their own learning. Based on their identified needs, the facilitators assisted them in locating knowledgeable people  to  help  them  in  their  professional  development.  For  example,  a registered  psychologist  was  contracted  to  facilitate  a  workshop  on  stress management, on the teachers' request. The researchers used a heuristic to map teacher professional development over the course of the two years and adopted the  profile  of  implementation  of  Rogan  and  Grayson  (2003)  and Rogan  and  Aldous  (2004),  which  focuses  on  four  domains  (dimensions), as can be seen in Table 7.1, namely:

SDL: self-directed learning; SDLI: self-directed learning instrument

- 1. classroom interaction (pedagogies used and how learning is facilitated)
- 2.  science  practical  work  (encompassing  how  the  tenets  of  science  are encapsulated in learning activities)
- 3.  science in society (whether learners will be able to appreciate the value of science in their daily lives and addressing affective outcomes)
- 4.  assessment practices.

The researchers' stance was that SDL should form the foundation of teacher professional development across these domains and, for this reason, a fifth domain  was  added,  namely,  SDL.  For  the  SDL  domain,  both  qualitative (interviews and observations) and quantitative descriptors (the SDLI of Cheng et al. 2010) were provided for each of the five levels (0-4) in the heuristic (Table 7.1).

## Mapping teachers' progress on the five-dimension (domain) heuristic

A description of the pre- and post-intervention data and findings, indicating professional  development,  for  one  of  the  10  teachers  is  described  in  the following  section.  Only  one  teacher  profile  was  shared  because  of  extent limitations.  The  rubric  descriptors  (Table  7.1)  were  used  to  map  teachers' competence. The three researchers did this mapping individually and then reached consensus.

## Data, data analysis and findings

In this section, Teacher A's data are presented to illustrate how the data were mapped using the profile of implementation.

## Personal profile of Teacher A

Teacher  A  holds  a  BEd  degree  in  natural  sciences  from  the  North-West University. Using the platforms provided during the professional development programme, she successfully  applied  for  a  BEd  Honours  degree  in  natural sciences Education for the 2020 academic year and is currently busy with postgraduate  studies.  In  the  pre-intervention  personal  interview,  Teacher A mentioned that she had 2 years' experience of teaching natural sciences Grade 7-9. Teacher A was a novice teacher under the age of 30 years. Her teaching philosophy was to be a lifelong learner who inspires other South African learners. Teacher A had a teaching and learning philosophy prior to the intervention that is shared by so many teachers, namely, that the best way of preparing learners for the examination is by using a lecture-style approach. (This was  determined  in  a  personal  interview  and  through  classroom observations.)

She taught at a school resembling a typical township school in terms of demographics,  consisting  of  100%  black  learners,  mostly  from  low-income families. The classes taught had 40 to 60 learners. The lessons observed were of  a  class  consisting  of  58  learners,  where  the  ratio  of  boys  to  girls  was approximately  2:1.  Teacher  A  mentioned  that  she  teaches  in  an  underresourced  township  school  without resources such as data projector, laboratory  consumables  and  microscopes,  and  with  no  access  to  library services.

According to Teacher A, the existing school laboratory was only utilised by the Grade 12 learners. She reported that the classroom did not inspire inquiry, and none of the many posters or equipment that the teacher received from this professional development intervention had been previously available to her (thanks to generous funding from the Fuchs Foundation, teachers were provided with resources; and it was disconcerting to see that these resources were not used by Teacher A). The teacher failed to create an inviting learning space for the learners. Nothing reminded the learners that, when they entered the natural sciences classroom, they were entering an 'epistemological space' of scientific investigation and problem-solving.

## Pre-intervention data: Teacher A

The  researchers  utilised  questionnaires,  classroom  observations,  personal interviews and visible light test to capture pre-intervention data related to the five  dimensions  (domains),  namely,  classroom  interaction,  practical  work, science and society, assessment and SDL.

## Classroom interaction

## esson observation using the reformed teaching observation L protocol instrument

Teacher  A  was  very  dependent  on  the  prescribed  textbook  during  all observations, and learner engagement in these teacher-centred lessons was restricted to answering questions in chorus or doing homework assignments on  a  low  cognitive  level  (according  to  Bloom's  taxonomy).  The  teacher's pedagogical orientation (of transmission-mode teaching and learning) was further demonstrated by the predominant culture of writing the notes on the chalkboard followed by question and answers.

The  teacher  used  transmission  mode  as  a  dominant  teaching  strategy, treating learners as tabula rasa . The teacher asked questions and only about 15  learners  were  superficially  involved  in  responding  to  the  lower-order questions.  Other  learners  seemed  tired,  disengaged  or  did  not  seem  to understand  the  work.  No  inquiry  activities  occurred  during  the  lesson observation.

## Pre-intervention interview with Teacher A, related to classroom interaction

During the pre-intervention interview, Teacher A mentioned:

'Science is boring to the learners, and it is also boring to the teachers because it  is  only  theory  and  we  are  repeating  the  same  thing  day  in  day  out.  It  is never exciting because the learners are not excited.' (Teacher A, female, date unknown)

According to this view and the classroom observations, it can be concluded that the teacher finds it difficult to contextualise the content prescribed in the curriculum  and  apply  it  to  the  everyday  life  of  learners.  There  is  a  lack  of agency displayed by Teacher A, and to a large extent the teacher portrays science as being static and Eurocentric in nature, and she does not seem to realise that she can 'decolonise' the curriculum, through contextualisation for diverse learners.

## Analysis of lesson plan, in terms of classroom interaction

No  formal  lesson  plan  was  presented  during  the  lesson  observation.  The teacher had notes on a sheet of paper and a textbook to guide the lesson. Despite the lack of a formal lesson plan, the lesson was semi-structured. The teacher did not start the lesson by providing the objectives for the learners or  sensitising  the  learners  to  the  goals  of  the  lesson.  During  the  invitation stage of the lesson, the teacher introduced the lesson by asking the learners where animals receive their food. The learners' prior knowledge was activated during a short discussion, and the teacher explained how energy is converted from one form to another. The body of the lesson consisted of transmissionmode approaches (no learner-centred pedagogies were used). In terms of assessment, only a class activity was provided, and no homework was given to the learners. In the closing stage of the lesson, learners were not required to reflect on or summarise the lesson.

## Content knowledge of optics (pre-intervention)

Teacher A, before the intervention on the optics section of the Curriculum and Assessment  Policy  statement  (CAPS)  curriculum,  scored  2/35  (5.7%)  in  a visible  light  test,  which  indicates  that  she  had  underdeveloped  CK.  This resonates with the concerns of Venkat and Spaull (2015) that many South African  science  teachers  have  CK  below  the  Grade  taught.  In  the  authors' view, this is one of the main reasons why South African learners perform below standard in international tests such as TIMSS.

## eacher A's views on practical (laboratory) work, inquiry T learning and the nature of science

## Inquiry learning in Teacher A's classroom

During the observed lessons (utilising the RTOP instrument), the teacher did not  engage  learners  in  inquiry.  Learners  were  mostly  passive  during  the teacher-centred classroom activities. They were not afforded an opportunity to  engage  in  the  nature  (tenets)  of  science  and  to  develop  their  science process skills such as interpreting data, making  careful observations, constructing an argument, measuring, problem-solving and critical thinking, recording and communicating information.

## eacher A's responses to the UJ-DNA Barcoding Questionnaire T and focus group interview, prior to the DNA barcoding intervention

To  improve  teachers'  understanding  of  the  tenets  of  science,  they  were afforded the opportunity to work (with scientists) for two days at the UJbased African Centre for DNA Barcoding. Prior to the intervention, teachers were asked to complete a questionnaire.

In the questionnaire, Teacher A reflected that she was 2 out of 5 confident in handling laboratory equipment. She also indicated the following sentiments, 'I do not have a laboratory to use at school. The last time I was in a laboratory, it was when I was at university' (Teacher A, female, date unknown). When the teacher was asked how often she does practical work in terms of laboratory investigations  with  her  learners,  her  response  was  as  follows:  'I  hardly  do practical work with my learners because I do not have a laboratory to use'. This indicates that most of her learners do not benefit from the affordances of practical work and that they do not optimally develop skills that enable them to  investigate  phenomena  or  develop  basic  science  process  skills  such  as observation, classification, inference of information from  data, making predictions, or communicate findings. This practice could explain why most of the students do not develop work-related skills for the 21st-century world, for instance,  critical  thinking  and  analysing.  Teacher  A  highlighted  in  the  prequestionnaire that she wants to learn more about DNA barcoding and how to use laboratory equipment. When she was asked what her understanding of DNA barcoding is, her response was 'I do not know much, but I think it is the sequence of genes (how genes are arranged)'. Again (as with her knowledge of optics), Teacher A showed underdeveloped CK.

When the teacher was asked what she understands by the term 'polymerase chain reaction' (PCR), her response was 'I have no idea'. When the teacher

was further asked how she as a teacher could make the study of DNA relevant and interesting to learners, the teacher's response was 'conduct investigations with  the  learners'.  The  responses  of  Teacher  A  indicated  that  she  was  not confident  in  doing  investigations  with  the  learners  because  of  the  lack  of resources in her school and her lack of agency to improvise. However, in her answers  she  provided  the  discourse  used  in  policy  documents  ('learner investigations') - paying lip-service to inquiry learning.

What  was  promising  was  that  Teacher  A  identified  her  own  learning needs - to learn more about DNA and to improve her investigation skills to provide  her  learners  with  more  nuanced  understandings  of  the  nature  of science.

## Teacher A's views of the nature of science

Teacher A had a partly informed view of the nature of science (VNOS). For instance,  in  the  VNOS  Questionnaire,  the  teacher  was  asked  about  the structure of the atom, and how scientists developed a model of the atom. Teacher A's responses indicated an underdeveloped understanding of atom modelling. However, she used popular jargon, such as 'uses models to explain how atoms look like', to camouflage her lack of insight. Her responses failed to provide a timeline on the development of an atom.

Teacher  A  could  not  provide  any  answers  which  demonstrated  an understanding  of  the  tenets  (nature)  of  science,  such  as  the  tentative, inferential or creative nature of science.

## Teacher A's views on science and society

## Portraying the role of science in society during lessons: evidence from the lesson observations using reformed teaching observation protocol, lesson plans and interviews

During the pre-intervention class observations, the authors noticed that the teacher did not contextualise her lessons and did not address the affective domain. The lessons were typically structured around textbook activities, and no  effort  was  made  to  contextualise  curriculum  content  for  the  learners. During  the  interview,  the  researchers  probed  to  understand  why  Teacher A said that science is boring. The response from the teacher was that science 'is boring to the learners and it is also boring to the teachers because it is only theory and we are repeating the same thing day in day out. It is never exciting because  the  learners  are  not  excited'.  This  narrative  is  alarming,  and  we realised that the teacher did not emphasise the importance of science in the society in her lessons. Science was portrayed as being contained in a silo far removed from the learners' everyday experiences.

## Teacher A's view on the nature of indigenous knowledge

Teacher A's understanding of indigenous knowledge was that:

'It  is  the  deep  knowledge  and  skills  unique  to  a  particular  indigenous  culture. This knowledge is passed on from one generation to another. It includes medical practices, production of food, etc.' (Teacher A, female, date unknown)

This view  demonstrates  that  the  teacher  had  some  understanding  of indigenous  knowledge.  When  Teacher  A  was  asked  if  practitioners  of indigenous  knowledge  do  engage  in  experiments  and  tests  to  verify  or validate  indigenous  knowledge  (IK),  her  response  showed  an  informed understanding of indigenous knowledge. Her response was:

'Yes, indigenous knowledge is based on human experiences. The practitioners of indigenous  knowledge  tried  different  methods  which  were  replaced  with  other methods if they were unsuccessful. This was continued till success. If a method was not working, they tried a different method.' (Teacher A, female, date unknown)

She  also  knew  that  the  Khoisan  used Hoodia  gordonii as  an  appetite suppressant. The only aspect in which Teacher A showed a uniformed view in the VNOIK Questionnaire was that she believed that IK stays the same, not recognising  that  it  is  a  dynamic  knowledge  base  that  evolves.  The  data obtained from the pre-intervention VNOIK Questionnaire suggest that Teacher A had a partially informed understanding of the tenets of IK. During classroom observations, there was no evidence of the integration of aspects of IK into lessons.  Even  though  the  teacher  had  a  partially  informed  view  of  IK,  she struggled to include IK in the natural sciences curriculum. One of the many reasons for this is that Teacher A in her undergraduate qualification was not taught and assisted with the integration of IK into the science curriculum (as inferred  from  the  interview  data).  Our  interpretation  is  that  Teacher  A understood the role of IK in science but struggled with the epistemological border crossing between the two knowledge systems in practice.

## Teacher A's views on assessment/assessment practices

The pre-intervention data showed that Teacher A 'teaches to the test' and that she did not engage in innovative assessment practices. Furthermore, her assessment only covered lower levels in Bloom's taxonomy, such as 'knowledge' (based  on  data  obtained  from  interviews  and  observations).  During  the classroom observations, of lessons on ecology, her assessment, for example, provided learners with one multiple choice question on what the purpose of the food chain is. This was followed with a question on matching column A with  B  (matching  descriptions  of  omnivores,  insectivores,  consumers  and producers).  In  question  3,  the  learners  were  provided  with  a  case  study involving  a  zebra,  grass  and  lions,  and  they  were  required  to  write  the information as a food chain, and this was followed with a question that required

the learners to label the producer and consumers. In question 4, a follow-up question required the learners to answer what would happen when the zebra (in the context of question 3) died.

Lower-order cognitive questions are insufficient in providing learners with problem-solving and critical thinking skills, which are abilities required for the 21st century. According to CAPS, assessment must be structured to cover CK as well as science process skills (De Beer 2019). From classroom observation and analysis of assessment provided to the learners, science process skills were not included. The teacher asked questions and wrote the solutions on the board as the learners answered. Very little attention was given to assessing learner ability to solve real-life problems.

## Teacher A's self-directed learning

## Qualitative analysis of self-directed learning

In terms of the revised Rogan and Grayson (2003) profile of implementation, Teacher A was mapped at level 1 based on qualitative data (the mapping was done based on the rubric provided in Table 7.1; it was done independently by the  three  researchers,  after  which  consensus  was  reached).  From  the  preintervention data, Teacher A did not demonstrate the agency to improve her teaching  strategy  or  to  learn  more  about  fostering  inquiry-based  learning. From the observed lessons, the teacher did not inspire learners to be selfdirected in their learning, and this could be because the teacher, at this stage, had a naive understanding of SDL (Bailey 2016; Bosch 2017).

That Teacher  A  voluntarily became  a  member  of  the  professional development programme can be regarded as an indication of interest in her own professional development. The decision required the teacher to, as a selfdirected learner, be able to identify her own professional development need(s). There  was  minimal  evidence  of  SDL;  the  teacher  indicated  that  she  had professional  development  needs,  but  she  did  not  identify  any  concrete learning goals.

## Quantitative analysis of Teacher A's self-directed learning, utilising the self-directed learning instrument

Teacher A completed the SDLI Questionnaire (Cheng et al. 2010) to determine her views on her own SDL skills. Teacher A scored 77 out of 100 in terms of the SDL instrument.  Her  SDL  is  indicated  in  terms  of  the  four  sub-domains  in the SDLI (Table 7.2). Her score in the SDLI was relatively high, yet the qualitative data did not provide much evidence of SDL.

This  places  her  on  level  3  (in  contrast  to  the  qualitative  analysis,  which suggests a level 1). Mentz and De Beer (2019) show that such a discrepancy often  occurs  between  quantitative  and  qualitative  SDL  data.  Very  often,

TABLE 7.2: Self-directed learning of Teacher A, based on her responses in the self-directed learning instrument.

| Sub-domain in the profile of  implementation   | Questions   | Score of Teacher A   | Score of Teacher A reported  as a percentage (%)   |
|------------------------------------------------|-------------|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Learning motivation                            | Q 1-6       | 26/30                | 86.66                                              |
| Planning and implementing                      | Q 7-12      | 20/30                | 66.67                                              |

| Interpersonal communication                    | Q 17-20     | 17/20                | 85.00                                              |
| Total                                          |             | 77/100               |                                                    |

participants have naive understandings of SDL when they start to engage in the intervention - as reflected by the relatively high score of Teacher A in the SDLI.

As shown in Table 7.2, she scored 26/30 in terms of learning motivation, which is reported as 87%. She appeared, therefore, motivated to learn. Teacher A's  responses  to  the  questionnaire  showed  a  strong  desire  to  constantly improve and excel in her learning. Teacher A furthermore indicated that she knew which learning strategies were appropriate for her to reach her learning goals.  This  indicates  that  the  teacher  feels  strongly  about  being  a  lifelong learner. In addition, she believes her interaction with others helps her plan for further  learning.  Her  aspirations  were  further  evidenced  by  her  efforts  to attend almost all the interventions. She also applied for postgraduate studies, as mentioned earlier.

It should also be emphasised that, even though Teacher A was motivated to learn, she scored the lowest score in planning and implementation in terms of the four sub-domains in the SDLI, namely, 20/30 (66%).

## Teacher A's holistic well-being

Although this aspect does not correlate with the five dimensions or domains in the profile of implementation, our research also focused on the well-being of teachers.

## Well-being of Teacher A

Teacher A indicated that she had to cope with tight deadlines (curriculum pacesetters)  that  caused  stress,  and  she  needed  to  learn  techniques  for dealing with stress. When Teacher A was interviewed, she mentioned that her job is stressful and that she sometimes struggled to cope with all the demands facing her.

## Professional development needs of Teacher A

Teacher  A  indicated  that  she  needed  to  be  assisted  with  the  following curriculum topics: electricity, chemistry and strategies to teach overcrowded classrooms.

## Post-intervention data - Teacher A

Teacher A actively participated in most of the intervention activities. The only intervention she did not participate in was the short learning programme on IK  organised  by  the  North-West  University.  In  the  section  that  follows,  we analyse the post-intervention data, based on the five domains (dimensions) in the profile of implementation.

## Classroom interaction and the pedagogical orientation of Teacher A after the intervention

Teacher  A  had  a  definite  'active  direct'  teaching  pedagogical  orientation (Ramnarain &amp; Schuster 2014). The teacher's pedagogical orientation did not change after the intervention. She still used transmission mode as a dominant teaching strategy, with very little engagement with the tenets of science. The DNA barcoding work did not seem to have much of an impact in terms of centre-staging the scientific method in the classroom. Despite being exposed to cooperative learning methodologies, such as the Jigsaw method, during the  intervention  Teacher  A  continued  with  transmission-mode  approaches, for example, writing notes and solutions on the board, and expecting a 'choruslike' response from learners.

## esson observations using the reformed teaching observation L protocol instrument

Teacher A started the observed lesson by determining background knowledge on visible light and asked learners, 'Why do we see a rainbow?'. The lesson was  unfortunately  still  teacher-centred,  despite  her  participation  in  the intervention  on  optics.  Learners  remained  seated  in  lecture-style  seating arrangement,  making  it  difficult  for  cooperative  learning.  There  was  no evidence of either problem-based or project-based learning, despite the topic lending itself to such approaches.

What was observed with Teacher A was the 'wash-out' effect (Zeichner &amp; Tabachnick  1981),  whereby  teachers  return  to  their  predominant  (prior) strategies when they return to the 'coalface of the classroom'. Even though Teacher A  was  provided  with a 'cognitive apprenticeship during the intervention' (Ramsaroop &amp; Gravett 2018), she continued with the transmissionmode teaching. What is puzzling is why Teacher A defaulted to transmissionmode teaching after being provided with the teaching skills, techniques and equipment to teach this exact topic in a problem-based manner.

Lortie's  (1975)  theory  of  the  'apprenticeship  of  observation'  provides  a possible reason for why Teacher A did not use the optics kit, PhET simulations, tablets and shoestring approaches that were provided during the intervention,

to  engage  learners  in  inquiry-based  learning.  Lortie  is  of  the  opinion  that teachers teach as they were taught (Lortie 1975). None of the newly acquired skills and approaches obtained during the intervention were evident during the post-intervention classroom observation. Learners still answered questions in chorus style.

## Analysis of post-intervention lesson plan

No lesson plan was prepared for the lesson observed. Only the textbook was used during the observed post-intervention lesson to engage the learners on the rainbow colours and one activity consisting of lower-order questions. For instance, the learners were required to define the terms luminous, wavelength and frequency. Questions such as where does the light come from, how does light travel, how do you see the light, name all colours in the visible spectrum and name all the colours in order of increasing wavelength were posed. The teacher did not provide learners with a lesson that encouraged inquiry. As in the  pre-intervention  lesson  observed,  transmission-mode  teaching  took place,  with  very  little  learner  engagement.  The  lesson  lacked  structured objectives, and the teacher did not reflect on the lesson. From the lesson observation and exit interview, it became clear that no reflection in, for and on practice was done.

## Exit interview and discussion of recorded lesson using stimulated video recall

During  the  exit  interview,  the  teacher  mentioned  that  systemic  pressures coming from her seniors lead her to teach the way she does (using transmission mode). For instance, when the teacher was asked, do you feel that there is a lot of pressure from parents and principals, or school management, to 'teach to the test' to 'ensure good results?', her response was:

'Yes, they tell you that you to need to be done with this topic on this date then you start with this one at least the principal would be on my case if I do not produce results, they will be on my case, so you just need to teach to the test, and the kids give us the results that they need so there is no time to have fun in the classroom.' (Teacher A, female, 26 November 2019)

The response was disheartening on two levels: firstly, that the teacher's seniors accept  transmission-mode  teaching  as  the  preferred  way  to  capacitate learners. Secondly, that the teacher's actions did not prepare learners with the SDL skills needed in our complex society. The teacher's response indicates that she is aware that she uses transmission-mode teaching, not addressing the nature of science. For instance, she mentioned that she is forced to 'teach to the test'. Hence, her pedagogical orientation did not change. She also referred to the curriculum schedules ('pacesetters') (DoE) as a hindrance to addressing the skills and techniques taught in the intervention. Teacher A felt frustrated

by the work schedule's inflexibility and prescribed time frames. Her teaching was based only on the content provided in the work schedule. However, she also  indicated  that  the  intervention  inspired  her  and  that  she  feels  more empowered for the challenging profession.

When the teacher was asked if the school setup enables her to engage learners in PBL, inquiry learning or cooperative learning, which were the focus of the intervention, her response was as follows:

'This school makes it impossible. We have fifty kids in the classroom so we cannot do group work we cannot arrange the tables, it asks for space, then we get over and done, and then we move on even when we have to do practical investigations of  the  classroom  it  becomes  difficult  because  you  cannot  keep  the  learners at all  the apparatus, there's a shortage of apparatus ….' (Teacher A, female, 26 November 2019)

## Teacher A's content knowledge on optics post-intervention

After  the  intervention  (an  optics  workshop),  Teacher  A  saw  a  percentage increase of 48% in her post-test. In her pre-test, she scored 2/35 (5.7%), and in the post-test, she scored 19/35 (54.3%). This could be an indication that the intervention  was  able  to  develop  her  CK  on  visible  light.  This  was  also evidenced by the greater confidence she showed when teaching visible light during  the  classroom  observation.  Overall,  this  teacher  benefited  from  the intervention  in  terms  of  increased  subject  knowledge  and  confidence  in teaching  the  content.  It  is  disconcerting,  however,  that  the  activities  and strategies presented in the intervention (e.g. the PhET simulations) were not transferred to her classroom teaching.

## eacher A's views on practical (laboratory) work, inquiry T learning and the nature of science after the intervention

## nquiry learning in Teacher A's classroom - Evidence from I classroom observations

No evidence of practical work or inquiry learning was provided or observed. What is disappointing is that there was no evidence that any of the resources provided to her (e.g. the optics kit, sponsored by the Fuchs Foundation) were used. Despite not having a laboratory, she was trained during the intervention to  use  shoestring  approaches.  A  spectroscope  has  the  affordances  of facilitating  inquiry-based  activities  on  visible  light  and  the  dispersion  of colours into their different wavelengths providing the colours of the rainbow. Despite the teacher being capacitated with skills  to  build  and  use  spectroscopes during the intervention, no evidence of inquiry-based activity was observed. What is to be highlighted is that Teacher A, in the questionnaire, highlighted that  the  intervention  addressed  her  professional  development  in  terms  of using  science-on-a-shoestring  approaches  in  under-resourced  classrooms.

Based  on  the  teacher's  feedback  from  the  questionnaire,  the  researchers conclude that Teacher A did not use inquiry-based activities despite having been equipped with the knowledge and skills to do so.

Teacher  A's  responses  regarding  the  value  of  shoestring  approaches  in fostering inquiry learning in the questionnaire were not congruent with the evidence obtained during the classroom observation. Another concern is that Teacher A did not engage learners in doing problem-based activities. When the teacher was asked to provide an example of how PBL could be used to teach optics in the questionnaire, her response was as follows, 'Give learners problems to solve using PhET simulations', but this was not evident in the classroom  observation.  The  teacher  could  have  used  PhET  simulations  to engage learners in an inquiry activity. According to Ledward and Hirata (2011), PhET simulations could assist in promoting 21st-century skills in place-based, project-based or PBL contexts. Teacher A was also provided with optic kits for  her  classroom.  Regardless  of  resourcing  the  teacher  with  the  methodological skills and equipment to facilitate inquiry activities, there was no evidence of transfer to the classroom.

## Teacher A's responses in the UJ-DNA Barcoding Questionnaire (and subsequent focus group interview)

In the post-questionnaire, Teacher A reflected that she is now (4 out of 5) confident in handling laboratory equipment after the intervention. She also indicated the following sentiments during the interview:

'I was feeling happy, I was excited to work with all the apparatus, and for me it was an experience. Once you like something, you are more interested in it. If we take it to the NS classroom, learners would be interested more in the subject because now they go to the classroom, we talk theory, and they do not know how to apply it in real life.' (Teacher A, female, date unknown).

She  further  emphasised  the  following  in  the  post-questionnaire:  'after  the experience  of  using  laboratory  equipment  at  the  African  Centre  for  DNA Barcoding (ACDB) I think I have gained a lot of lab skills'.

In the focus group interview, Teacher A made the following remark 'it was fun, we learned new things. I cannot wait to go back to the classroom and share the information which I have learned'.

An important remark made by Teacher A during the interview was:

'I  see  that  there  is  much  more  to  be  done  in  classroom.  I've  been  robbing  my learners, now I realise why I was not getting those good marks because my kids were not motivated enough. With the knowledge I gained in two days, if I can take that knowledge and pass it all to my kids, pass on the skills, my learners will be much more interested in the subject.' (Teacher A, female, date unknown).

Despite  this  encouraging  data,  there  was  little  evidence  of  transformed teaching after the intervention.

The  data,  therefore,  point  to  the  'wash-out  effect'  of  newly  acquired knowledge and skills in the classroom after the intervention. Regardless of the well-planned intervention, the teacher resorted back to the same old ways of teaching, and no learner practical skills were enhanced.

## Teacher A's views on the nature of science

Teacher A did not attend the short learning programme (SLP) on 18-19 March 2019.  Amongst  many  activities  that  the  teacher  engaged  in,  a  strong emphasis was based on activities that demonstrate the nature of science (NOS).

However,  Teacher  A  did  attend  the  DNA  barcoding  intervention,  which aimed to achieve the same understanding of the processes of science. After the  intervention,  in  the  VNOS  Questionnaire,  Teacher  A  showed  a  more informed  view  on  the  NOS.  She  developed  a  better  understanding  of  the inferential and empirical NOS. However, her views were not in sync with the classroom observations, as during the lesson, not a single element of the NOS (tenets of science) was evident.

## eacher A's views on science and society after the T intervention

## Portraying the role of science in society during lessons: evidence from the lesson observations using reformed teaching observation protocol, lesson plan and interviews

In the exit interview, Teacher A mentioned how IK could be integrated into a lesson  and  how  this  knowledge  can  make  the  lesson  more  interesting  to learners. However, no attempt to infuse IK into the lesson, or an attempt to contextualise the lesson using some of the IK applicable to the topic of optics, was evident.  For  instance,  when  one  teaches  visible  light,  it  is  possible  to make a connection to rainbow colours. The rainbow is a very familiar natural phenomenon, and colours play a pivotal role in most IK systems. For instance, the  Ndebele  relate  colours  to  the  status  or  power  of  the  homeowner,  and paintings on the house could indicate a period of prayer or the announcement of  marriage  (Sebotsa  2020).  The  authors  are  of  the  view  that,  if  Teacher A  addressed  colour  from  an  IK  perspective,  it  would  have  centralised  the affective domain.

During the classroom observations, Teacher A did not attempt to show the relevance of science in society and continued to marginalise the affective domain.

The  data  show  that  Teacher  A  found  it  challenging  to  facilitate  the epistemological  border  crossing  between  science  and  IK  (and  society).

Despite  an  awareness  of  her  learners  experiencing  science  as  uninspiring, there were minimal attempts by her to address the promotion of affective outcomes.

## Teacher A's view on the nature of indigenous knowledge

Teacher A still  held  a  partially  informed  view  of  the  nature  of  IK  after  the intervention, probably because she could not participate in the SLP on IK and this knowledge was also not centre-staged during her BEd degree.

## eacher's views on assessment practices: Reformed T teaching observation protocol and lesson plan

From the last lesson observed, it was clear that the teacher still 'teaches to the  test', and  lower-order  questions  in  Bloom's  taxonomy  were  still favoured. Teacher A did not attend the SLP and did not submit a portfolio for that reason. From the lesson observations, we could conclude that the teacher  asks  lower-order  cognitive  questions  and  does  not  engage  in innovative assessment practices, for example, peer assessment. She utilised ineffective  assessment  techniques.  For  example,  after  a  teacher-centred lesson, the assessment involved learners using their textbooks to answer  lower-level  cognitive  questions.  The  teacher  then  called  upon individual  learners  to  write  the  answers  on  a  whiteboard  in  front  of  the class. The researchers realised that much time is spent on very ineffective assessment  procedures.  While  learners  were  writing  answers  on  the whiteboard, other learners were talking to each other or did homework for other subjects. A significant limitation observed was the lack of assessment of affective and psychomotor outcomes.

## Qualitative analysis of self-directed learning

To map Teacher A's development on the profile of implementation rubric, interviews and post-intervention data were used to determine if the teacher facilitated  self-directed  skills  among  her  learners.  Evidence  of  enhanced SDL  was  that,  motivated  by  the  intervention,  Teacher  A  successfully registered  for  BEd  (Honours)  studies  in  the  natural  sciences  for  2020. When prompted about this in the exit interview, she responded that this intervention  made  her  realise  she  needs  to  invest  in  her  professional development.

She identified several aspects that she needed training on and identified personal  learning  goals  such  as  becoming  more  competent  in  teaching electricity  topics.  Teacher  A  displayed  several  of  the  qualities  of  a  self-

directed learner, for example, her enthusiasm in terms of the intervention offerings. She  could  use  resources  during  the  intervention  and  use strategies to simulate inquiry-based activities. However, at the coal face of teaching  in  the  classroom,  no  transformative  teaching  was  observed, critical  reflection  was  not  evident  and  the  teacher  did  not  demonstrate agency to use science-on-a-shoestring in her under-resourced classroom. According to the profile of implementation rubric, Teacher A was mapped on level 2.

## Quantitative analysis of Teacher A's self-directed learning, utilising the self-directed learning instrument

To map Teacher A's development, the SDLI instrument was used. Teacher A's views in the pre- and post-intervention were compared (Table 7.3).

Even though Teacher A still valued learning motivation in the four subdomains of SDL, her scores dropped from 26/30 to 25/30. This remained a domain Teacher A felt strongly about. The same patterns can be seen in terms of planning and implementation (a drop from 20 in the pre-test to 18 in the post-test). Research indicates that when participants complete the pre-SDL instrument, most of the participants have naive understandings of SDL (Bailey 2016; Bosch 2017). After the intervention, the teachers were generally more sensitised in terms of what SDL entails. In the post-intervention data, Teacher A scored 71 out of 100 (6 points lower than in the pre-test). In terms of the revised Rogan and Grayson's heuristic, both the qualitative and quantitative data indicate that Teacher A was at level 2 in terms of her SDL professional development after the intervention.

The drop in the score in the SDLI (from 77 to 71) seems to indicate that Teacher  A  became  less  self-directed  as  the  intervention  unfolded.  In  all

SDL, self-directed learning.

likeliness, she now has a more realistic view of her own SDL and what SDL entails.  However,  qualitative  data  provide  a  different  picture.  We  concur with Mentz and De Beer (n.d.:25) that 'the utilisation of quantitative and qualitative methods could result in dichotomous data' and that CulturalHistorical Activity Theory (CHAT) holds many affordances for opening this 'black box'.

## Professional development needs

After the visit to the African Centre for DNA Barcoding, Teacher A identified a number of goals for her own professional development (e.g. learning more about PCR and laboratory protocols) (Sebotsa et al. 2019:355). She successfully applied for registration for an Honours degree, fuelled by the realisation that she needs to invest in her own professional development and to become a more self-directed learner.

## Synthesis: Using the revised Rogan and Grayson's heuristic to assess teacher professional growth and plotting learning/development during a longitudinal and systemic teacher development programme

Below we show how the revised Rogan and Grayson's profile of implementation, with the addition of SDL as fifth dimension, can be used to monitor Teacher A's learning. This heuristic assisted the authors to evaluate if Teacher A showed evidence  of  transformed  teaching  during  the  post-intervention.  Below  we provide  Teacher  A's  progress  during  the  longitudinal  teacher  development programme.

As  can  be  seen  in  Box  7.1,  a  slight  improvement  was  shown  after  the intervention in three of the domains: classroom interaction, assessment and SDL.

## Second stage data analysis: Using culturalhistorical activity theory to investigate the themes

Mentz and De Beer (2019) described CHAT as a meta-theoretical framework that can assist the researcher in analysing data from complex environments. Cultural-Historical Activity Theory is used to provide insight into the qualitative and quantitative data.

We conclude this chapter by shedding more light on the above data and findings, by using third-generation CHAT (Figure 7.1).

## Evidence of self-directed learning, yet no agency to transform teaching practices

Teacher A showed a slight improvement in terms of SDL, as shown in Box 7.1. In terms of the revised Rogan and Grayson heuristic, Teacher A moved from level  1  to  level  2  in  the  domain  of  SDL.  This  indicates  that  the  intervention capacitated the teacher in terms of the SDL domain. According to Knowles, this indicates that Teacher A could formulate her learning goals, but there is limited evidence that learning resources or learning strategies were identified. It was disconcerting in the post-intervention classroom to find little evidence of Teacher A showing agency in the other four domains, namely, classroom interaction, practical work, science and society, and assessment. What was observed  in  the  post-intervention  classroom  was  that  the  teacher  did  not change,  did  not  inspire  learners  to  be  self-directed  learners  and  mostly reverted to 'chalk-and-talk' approaches. There was very little evidence of SDL.

## Tensions in the activity system that prevent transformed teaching practices

Cultural-Historical  Activity  Theory  provides  a  unique  gaze  on  factors  that negatively impact transformed teaching and learning. In terms of the CHAT analysis (Figure 7.1), there exists a tension between the division of labour and the object. The teacher did not show the agency to transform her teaching in the post-intervention classroom, and there was also very little evidence of critical reflection.  The  tools  utilised  in  the  classroom  (predominantly  transmissionmode approaches, e.g., a dependency on lectures and the textbook) did not foster SDL. Very limited data exist that show that the intervention pedagogies were transferred to the classroom. The community (principal and parents) are not  always  supportive  in  terms  of  promoting  PBL  and  SDL.  Pressure  is experienced by the subject (teacher) to prepare learners for the examination. Evidence  exists  of  nascent  SDL  in  Teacher  A,  but  this  does  not  lead  to transformed teaching practices or the development of teacher agency.

## Conclusion

Based on this research, there are several design principles that should be kept in mind when planning and implementing TPDPs. The most important one is that SDL should underpin all teacher professional development interventions. Teachers should be involved in deciding upon the content of TPDPs, and they should take ownership of their own learning.

There is a big need to engage in-service teachers in authentic laboratory work to enhance their understanding of the tenets of science. An international example of this  is  the  Target  Inquiry  project  of  Miami  University  in  Ohio, 22

spearheaded by Yezierski and Herrington (2011). Teacher A was one of the participants who engaged in laboratory work at the African Centre for DNA Barcoding  at  the  University  of  Johannesburg.  However,  this  short-lived experience  was  not  enough,  and  longer  interventions  are  needed.  This intervention does not lead to transformed teaching and learning. Furthermore, teachers also need support in developing knowledge and skills in engaging pedagogies and in IK systems, to contextualise science curriculum themes for culturally diverse South African students.

As could be seen in Figure 7.1, there was a 'contradiction of control' (McNeil 2013) in terms of the 'object' in the activity systems. The intervention does not lead  to  transformed  teaching  and  learning.  Mentz  and  De  Beer  (2019) suggested that all stakeholders should be involved from the beginning when such professional development is planned. Mentz and De Beer (2019) and De Beer  (2019)  referred  to  the  value  of  'change  laboratories',  where  all  the stakeholders engage in negotiating a shared 'object'. Engeström (2011:612) portrayed a change laboratory as 'a microcosm in which potential new ways of working can be experienced and experimented with'. Stakeholders come together during such Change Laboratories, to discuss the intended object (in this  context,  the  intended  outcomes  of  professional  development)  and  to reach consensus on a shared object. An overarching theme in this chapter is that  teachers  often  fall  back  on  transmission-mode  approaches,  despite interventions that emphasise inquiry learning, because of expectations of, and pressure from, principals and parents. By involving teachers, principals, subject advisors,  the  Department  of  Education,  teacher  unions,  parents  and  the broader community in the conceptualisation of the PD intervention, one could avoid the 'contradiction of control' between the intended and realised objects.

Based on the above suggestion of engaging in 'change laboratories', the fourth-generation CHAT, as proposed by Engeström (2011) and Mentz and De Beer (2019), can provide an ideal lens. This is a nascent approach to research on  teacher  professional  development,  which  has  enormous  potential  for providing greater insights into this complex area of research.

The revised profile of implementation could aid as a heuristic for teacher educators to include SDL as a design principle in TPDPs. Self-directed learning is needed for a natural sciences teacher to develop in each of the other four dimensions or domains as suggested by Rogan and Grayson (2003), namely, classroom  interaction,  science  practical  work  or  inquiry  learning,  sciencein-society  perspectives  and  assessment  practices.  The  revised  heuristic (provided  in  Table  7.1)  provides  a  vehicle  to  map  teacher  professional development during TPDP. Mapping teachers' professional development in this way provides insights into the effectiveness of professional development interventions.

## Abstract

In  this  qualitative  study,  we  explored  collaboration  as  a  21st-century  skill to  enhance  SDL  while  teaching  Grade  10  Chemistry  through  PBL.  Social interdependence  theory  (SIT)  was  used  as  theoretical  framework.  The implementation of PBL to enhance collaboration skills for the benefit of learners could help promote SDL, which, in turn, could improve educational results and create better chances for learners to find work. This was a case study of one beginner  teacher  from  one  high  school  in  the  North  West  province,  South Africa.  Data  were  collected  by  means  of  an  open-ended  questionnaire,  a reflective portfolio and a semi-structured interview. The data were analysed manually using Saldaña's model and Golightly's assessment rubric. The results show that it is possible for teachers without any prior knowledge of PBL to implement it successfully. Furthermore, the results indicate that, during PBL implementation,  learners  rely  more  on  themselves  as  a  group  than  on  the teacher. However, the results also revealed that using such an unusual approach might  make  teachers  uncomfortable.  Therefore,  it  is  recommended  that intervention programmes be presented to enable teachers to improve their skills in implementing PBL in the Physical Sciences classroom.

## Introduction

The aim of this research was to explore a 21st-century skill (i.e. collaboration) to enhance SDL while teaching the topic Particulate Nature of Matter (PNM) through  PBL  after  a  teacher  professional  development  (TPD)  programme. According to Rovers et al. (2018:416), '[PBL] is a comprehensive educational approach that is based on cognitive theories of learning and has continued to be important in education curricula across the world'. According to Overton and Randles (2015:251), PBL is 'the learning that results from the process of working toward the understanding or resolution of a problem'. The implementation  of  PBL  as  educational  approach  could  help  promote  SDL among the learners and teachers in a classroom (Golightly 2019:143). Selfdirected learning is a process whereby learners analyse their own learning needs, express purpose and select accurate approaches (Zainuddin &amp; Perera 2018:282). According to Knowles (1975), SDL comprises three critical parts: the learner, the teacher and the learning resources (the learning resources in this regard being PBL and the content of the topic PNM).

According to Yasmin, Naseem and Masso (2019:35), SDL is associated with desirable  educational  results  and  better  chances  of  finding  employment. Twenty-first-century skills, such as collaboration, are core competencies for learning that can help learners in  today's  ever  changing,  globally  interconnected world (Howlett &amp; Waemusa 2019:74). Learners should be exposed to real-life problems, should be encouraged to communicate in and outside teaching-

learning situations, should collaborate with friends and should think critically (Wyness &amp; Dalton 2018:3).

## Problem statement

Afandi,  Akhyar  and  Suryani  (2019:90)  claimed  that  teachers  have  a  vital responsibility to support the development of their learners' 21st-century skills. According to Ceylan and Yiğital (2016:57), teachers fail to encourage, guide and  promote  21st-century  skills  in  their  learners.  The  current  teaching approaches implemented by teachers do not match the needs of the 21stcentury world (Häkkinen et al. 2017:35). Also, there is a growing global need for 21st-century science teaching, as was also observed by Bustamante, White and Greenfield (2018:34) in the United States.

## Research questions

The following research questions guided this research:

- · How does a beginner physical sciences teacher's implementation of PBL enhance the development of collaboration as a 21st-century skill in learners for SDL while teaching PNM?
- · What are the beginner physical sciences teacher's challenges, if any, when implementing PBL to enhance the development of collaboration as a 21stcentury skill in learners for SDL while teaching PNM?

## Theoretical framework and literature review Theoretical framework

Social interdependence theory was used as theoretical framework. Formally coined  by  Deutsch  (1949a,  1949b)  for  the  effect  of  cooperation  and competitiveness on small group functioning, SIT was defined by Johnson and Johnson (1999, 2005, 2009) as the shared influence between individuals in a small  group.  Social  interdependence  theory  is  primarily  associated  with collaboration, small group learning and cooperative learning. Previously, SIT was successfully implemented in education (Johnson &amp; Johnson 1974, 2009; Slavin 1988). Problem-based learning is one of the learning approaches with a theoretical foundation premised on SIT (Torre, Van der Vleuten &amp; Dolmans 2016:190). As the tenets of PBL are aligned to the broader philosophy of SIT (Torre et al. 2016), the researchers saw it fit to incorporate PBL as a conceptual construct of SIT.

In this research, a small group learning approach was used during a PBL TPD programme and the implementation of PBL in the classroom, taking a

leaf  from  Johnson  and  Johnson  (2009).  They  reported  the  success  of  SIT when implemented in the field of education. According to Johnson, Johnson and Smith (1995), when applying SIT:

[ T ]he teacher ought to see a teaching-learning situation in terms of six principles: (1) Knowledge is constructed and extended by learners; (2) The learners are actively involved  in  constructing  their  own  knowledge;  (3)  The  teacher's  effort  must  be aimed  at  developing  and  enhancing  learners'  skills;  (4)  Education  is  a  personal transaction among the learners, between the learners and the teacher and work given;  (5)  Creating  a  conducive  and  cooperative  atmosphere  facilitates  active mastery of concepts; (6) Considerable teacher training and continuous refinement of skills and procedures. (pp. 8-10)

An exploration of the schools of thought on the core model of SIT yielded a  two-dimensional  realisation:  on  the  one  hand,  positive  interdependence (cooperative) and, on the other hand, negative (competitive) interdependence (Deutsch 1949b, 1962; Johnson &amp; Johnson 2003; Jongman 2017).  Positive  interdependence  entails  when  one  member's  actions  foster another member's goals to reach common goals in a small group (Johnson &amp; Johnson 2019:45). Each group member assumes a key role so that the success of  the  group  work  is  based  on  whether  everyone  succeeds  in  their  role (Johnson &amp; Johnson 2019; Li 2017). Social interdependence theory gives a broad concept of SDL that results from collaboration. In contrast, negative interdependence  occurs  when  one  group  member's  actions  impede  the attainment  of  joint  goals  of  a  small  group.  Negative  interdependence recognises that learners working in a small group do not always approach a given task collaboratively and may view it as competition instead (Hartmann 2017:633). This research was significantly influenced by positive interdependence. Problem-based learning implementation requires that every group  member  contributes  towards  a  common  goal.  This  is  achieved  by requiring  that  each  learner  in  the  group  assumes  a  key  role  -  such  as  the leader, scriber and researcher - which ultimately contributes to group work.

## Problem-based learning and self-directed learning

Ansarian and Teoh (2018:1) argued that 'PBL was practised long before it was even  known  as  a  'scientific'  approach'.  The  McMaster  Faculty  of  Health Sciences (McMaster University, Canada) is widely known to have championed the  PBL educational approach in their curriculum in the late 1960s (Lee &amp; Kwan 1997; Savery 2019; Servant-Miklos, Norman &amp; Schmidt 2019; ServantMiklos,  Woods  &amp;  Dolmans  2019b).  Problem-based  learning  features  SDL (Ansarian &amp; Teoh 2018; Barrows 1996:7). Knowles (1975) described SDL as follows:

[ A ] process in which individuals take the initiative, with or without the help of others in, 1) diagnosing their learning needs; 2) formulating learning goals; 3) identifying

human  and  material  resources  for  learning;  4)  choosing  and  implementing appropriate learning strategies; and 5) evaluating learning outcomes. (p. 18)

According to Achilles and Hoover (1996:19) and Koh and Chapman (2019:75), PBL as an educational approach effectively promotes SDL in learners from the school level (kindergarten to Grade 12) to the tertiary level.

Problem-based learning entails the use of an ill-structured problem, such that  learning  starts  from  a  problem  and  moves  to  theory  where  there  are multiple  solutions  (Abdullah,  Mohd-Isa  &amp;  Samsudin  2019;  Akçay  2009; Golightly 2020; Hüttel &amp; Gnaur 2017; Seleke, Havenga &amp; De Beer 2019). Hung (2019:249)  stated  that  such  an  ill-structured  problem  must  'contextualise abstract  content  knowledge  to  practical  meaningful  working  knowledge'. During PBL, learners working in groups of four to six members are presented with an  ill-structured problem  of  which  the  'solutions  require certain information  and  skills  that  they  do  not  yet  possess'  (Poë  2015:280).  Once presented with an ill-structured problem, the learners in the PBL process: (1) identify facts, (2) formulate learning objectives, (3) identify and select learning material,  (4)  apply  new  knowledge,  and  (5)  evaluate  learning  objectives (Hmelo-Silver  2004:236).  This  PBL  process  happens  through  SDL  (HmeloSilver 2004; Hung, Moallem &amp; Dabbagh 2019). The SDL and PBL processes discussed here are more similar than contrary to each other.

Problem-based learning assessment focuses mainly on the learning process (Lee 2013) and entails learner-based assessment (self-assessment and peerassessment) and teacher-based assessment (facilitator assessment), promoting SDL in the learners (Ansari et al. 2015:263). This research, however, focused  on  teacher-based  assessment.  In  West  Nusa  Tenggara,  Indonesia, Nursa'ban,  Masykuri  and  Yamtinah  (2019)  implemented  PBL  in  a  Grade  11 Natural  Sciences  classroom.  They  found  that  the  implementation  of  PBL conducted consistently could enhance science learners' SDL. In a qualitative study  with  35  chemistry  learners  in  Malaysia,  Peen  and  Arshad  (2017) investigated collaboration and SDL in a PBL lesson. Their findings showed that both collaboration and SDL were enhanced in groups of learners during the  implementation  of  PBL.  Although  their  findings  showed  comparatively high occurrences of collaboration and lower SDL, the implementation of PBL in a chemistry classroom overall enhanced learners' collaboration and SDL.

Havenga (2018b:318) believed that learners working in PBL groups for the first time may experience challenges such as time constraints, problems with communication and staying focused. In the Philippines, Valdez and Bungihan (2019:282)  implemented  PBL  in  a  Grade  9  Chemistry  classroom  aimed  at enhancing their problem-solving skills. Their findings showed that implementing PBL might be challenging in a larger classroom and may have undesired outcomes.

## Collaboration as a 21st-century skill and self-directed learning

The  acquisition  of  21st-century  skills,  including  collaboration,  is  associated with SDL (Turiman, Wook &amp; Osman 2019:46-47), which is recognised 'as a crucial  aspect  of  learning  for  the  21st  century'  (Van  Zyl  &amp;  Mentz  2019:70). Collaboration is  defined  as  'working  together  in  small  groups  to  achieve  a common goal' (Chen &amp; Kuo 2019:95). By acquiring collaboration as a 21stcentury skill, learners might be ready to face complex real-life situations such as  work  experiences  and  day-to-day  survival  (Al  Kandari  &amp;  Al  Qattan 2020:554).  Moreover,  according  to Stehle and  Peters-Burton  (2019:4), 'collaboration is an important skill to enhance SDL'. Collaboration can focus on the quality of the group outcomes, and its process measures group success (Collazos et al. 2007:258). Havenga (2018a:255) emphasised that collaboration is a necessary skill in groups when solving real-world problems, as it is one of the ways to instil professional practice. Golightly and Raath (2015:64) argued that PBL enhances collaboration skills.

According to Sebotsa, De Beer and Kriek (2019), teachers are not familiar with  the  concept  of  SDL.  Individuals  with  SDL  skills  in  this  ever  changing world, where workplaces and professions often change because of economic instability, are most likely to adapt by learning more for their job security and personal  development  (Aoki  2020:42).  Cheng  et  al.  (2010:1157)  mentioned several  ways  in  which  learners  can  exhibit  SDL:  'knowing  what  to  learn; enjoying  to  find  answers  to  questions;  establishing  own  learning  goals; arranging  and  controlling  own  learning  time;  and  knowing  how  to  find resources for own learning'. In a study conducted by Thakur, Dutt and Chauhan (2018), PBL was implemented in a Grade 9 Biology class in New Delhi, India. These authors concluded that PBL is one of the best strategies to motivate, interest and encourage learners; it promotes scope for social interaction; and it promotes  discussion,  sharing  of  ideas  and  collaboration.  Furthermore, Sekarini, Wiyanto and Ellianawati (2020) suggested that PBL is an effective learning model that could be implemented to develop the 21st-century skill of collaboration.

## raits of beginner physical sciences teachers and T particulate nature of matter

Scholars have different definitions for the concept of beginner teachers . The term beginner teachers refers to teachers who have recently qualified from HE  institutions  and  entered  the  education  system  to  practise  teaching.  In addition,  a  beginner  teacher  may  have  spent  many  years  (more  than  five years) in the education system but have recently (less than five years) begun teaching a particular subject. According to Mahmoudi and Özkan (2015:58),

beginner teachers are those with little or no experience, who often have less than two years of teaching experience. In the case of this research, the term beginner  teachers refers  to  teachers  who  have  recently  started  teaching physical  sciences,  have  five  years  or  less  practical  experience,  and  hold relevant teaching qualifications, such as a Bachelor of Education (BEd), BEd Honours or the Postgraduate Certificate in Education. Beginner teachers are new to the teaching profession and classroom practice, and therefore, their teaching approaches, or rather their PCK, are at the 'novice' level (Van Heerden 2019:29). Beginner teachers often face complex and dynamic challenges, such as personnel, organisations and environments (Robson &amp; Mtika 2017:243).

Chaves (2018:98-100) outlined some traits of beginner teachers: struggling to make their subject fun, under-preparedness in terms of teaching techniques and  approaches,  and  struggling  with  some  CK.  Surprisingly,  more  than  a decade later, Chaves corroborated the suggestion of Davis, Petish and Smithey (2006:610)  that  science  content,  science  discipline,  learners'  approach, learning environment and professionalism are the five key aspects relating to the  challenges  that  most  beginner  science  teachers  encounter.  From  the above literature, it can be inferred that most beginner teachers, among other challenges, struggle with delivering content effectively.

In the South African curriculum, physical sciences is a combination of two fields: Physics and chemistry (Ogegbo, Gaigher &amp; Salagaram 2019; Samuel &amp; Dudu 2018). Particulate Nature of Matter is one of the fundamental concepts in  physical  sciences for one to understand subsequent topics in chemistry. This  is  a  chemistry  component  of  physical  sciences  in  the  South  African curriculum  that is abstract and  presents  multiple  teaching  challenges (Harrison &amp; Treagust 2002; Pitjeng 2015). Yakmaci-Guzel and Adadan (2013) supported this by saying that PNM is:

[ P ]art of basic concepts in school science curricula worldwide from Grades 6 to 12, where learners are exposed to the structure of matter and three physical states, classification of matter, and different representational levels. (p. 110)

According to Merritt and Krajcik (2013:16), learners learn about PNM through daily experiences and classroom instruction. Therefore, we suggest that PBL, which allows the integration of real-life and class-taught content, be used.

## Teacher professional development

Teacher professional development is a structured professional learning activity that  aims  to  bring  about  changes  or  improvements  in  teachers'  practices so  that  learners'  learning  can  improve  (Bates  &amp;  Morgan  2018;  DarlingHammond, Hyler &amp; Gardner 2017). Teacher professional development for inservice teachers is considered 'an important factor in improving South African education  and  teachers'  confidence'  (Christiansen  &amp;  Bertram  2019:79).

Darling-Hammond et al. (2017:7) further stated that TPD should be linked with teachers'  experiences  and  teaching  standards.  Dudu  (2014)  reported  that South African Physical Sciences teachers acknowledge that TPD improved their teaching approaches and CK, as it was directly linked with their daily experiences.  A  South  African  study  by  De  Villiers,  De  Beer  and  Golightly (2016) with 75 Life Sciences teachers from two provinces is an example of a study that administered TPD on PBL and SDL. These researchers reported that only a few of the teachers admitted to knowing about the PBL approach; however, they did not know how to use it because of a lack of confidence in their skills to manage it. The findings of the latter study further showed that, while other teachers were knowledgeable about PBL, most of the teachers admitted to being clueless in this regard. This is alarming, hence underscoring the need for a PBL TPD programme.

Lee and Blanchard (2019) reported that a TPD programme on PBL increases teachers' intention to implement PBL in their classrooms. Teacher professional development is an important factor in maintaining a strong workforce and keeping up with the 21st century (Wozniak 2020:195). People need some skills to either get or secure jobs and, as stated by Hunter and Molapo (2014:317), 'when  the  departments  of  education  or  educational  systems  adopt  a  new curriculum or teaching approach, teachers in the field will require training'.

## Methodology

## Purpose of the research

The aim of this research was (after presenting a TPD programme) to explore collaboration as a 21st-century skill to enhance SDL while a beginner physical sciences teacher taught Grade 10 Chemistry (PNM) through PBL.

## Research design

In order to determine the effectiveness of a PBL approach to promote the 21st-century skill of collaboration, a qualitative research method was applied. For this research, it was ideal to adopt an exploratory qualitative case study approach (Thanh &amp; Thanh 2015:26).

## Data collection instrument

Data were collected by means of a self-developed open-ended questionnaire, a participant portfolio (after implementing PBL following a TPD programme) and a semi-structured interview. The data collected by means of the openended questionnaire were used (November-December 2019) to organise an effective  TPD  programme  to  meet  the  participant's  needs.  After  the  TPD

programme,  the  portfolio  by  the  participant  was  used  to  document  the implementation of PBL (February 2020) in a Grade 10 Chemistry classroom. The  portfolio  contained  the  following  data:  the  PBL  lesson  plan,  the  PBL problem  used  during  implementation,  the  teacher's and  the learners' roles  during  the  PBL  implementation,  learners'  worksheets,  21st-century skills  observed,  teacher-based  and  learner-based  assessment  rubrics,  and details  on  what  happened  during  the  PBL  lesson.  Some  of  the  interview questions were adapted from the Cheng et al.'s (2010:1157) SDLI, while others were self-developed by researchers (post-PBL implementation, March 2020) to explore the participant's views, perceptions and experiences. Examples of items from the SDLI are 'can your learners connect new knowledge with their own personal experiences? Explain' and 'explain how your learners evaluate their own learning outcomes'.

## Teacher professional development programme

It is worth noting that this research is part of a larger project, but the focus of this research was a case of one teacher. A pseudonym ('Keobiditse') was used to protect the identity of the teacher participant (Mukungu 2017). A one-dayday PBL TPD programme was presented (January 2020) for those teachers who participated in the larger project. The purpose of this programme was to enhance the use of PBL by beginner physical sciences teachers to promote 21st-century skills while teaching PNM. The teacher participants were given a problem (Box 8.1) to work on which they had to use during the implementation of PBL to enhance collaboration as a 21st-century skill.

The physical  sciences  (chemistry)  content  for  this  problem  was  aligned with the CAPS. It was further properly planned and aligned with the Annual Teaching Plan (ATP) 2020 (DBE 2011): the content of the problem was for term 1 (January to March) when the PBL was implemented. Finally, for the PBL activity,  the  participant  was  shown  how  to  assess  learners'  work  using Golightly's (2013) assessment rubric.

BOX 8.1: A PBL problem.

## Problem: Chemistry of Matter and Materials (Particulate Nature of Matter)

The central heating in your home during the winter season is the cooking stove. You realised that you could warm your kitchen by turning on the stove and keeping the oven door open. During summer evenings, it is hot and you cannot open windows because of mosquitos flying into the house. Some of your classmates are of the opinion that you could cool your kitchen by leaving the refrigerator door open. However, your parents disagree with your classmates' views. You discussed this with your chemistry teacher, after which he or she decided that you had to solve this problem in your PBL groups. You had to do research and inform the rest of the class of your findings regarding the abovementioned problem.

## Site selection, sampling technique and sample

The research was conducted in one of the four districts of the North West province in South Africa, namely, the Ngaka Modiri Molema district, because of the geographical proximity and accessibility to the researchers. The Ngaka Modiri Molema district consists of various area offices. However, Keobiditse was purposively  selected  from  one  area  office  in  the  said  district.  Keobiditse (23)  had  been  teaching  physical  science  for  a  year  and  was  therefore considered  a  beginner  teacher.  Keobiditse  completed  a  BEd  degree  the previous year (2018), majoring in physical sciences and mathematics. At the time of the research, he was teaching in a township secondary school and had two  Grade  10  classes,  from  which  one  class  of  26  learners  was  randomly selected to implement PBL in the teaching of PNM. He divided the learners into four groups: six members in two groups, respectively, and seven members in  the  other  two  groups,  respectively.  Moreover,  he  focused  more  on  one group for close observation.

## Data analysis

Saldaña's  (2009)  model  was  adopted  as  tool  for  the  data  analysis.  The transcribed data from open-ended questionnaires, some of the contents of the  portfolio  and  interview  were  coded.  Additionally,  the  physical  sciences assessment rubric for the PBL activity (chemistry - PNM) was adapted from Golightly (2013) and was used to assess learners' PBL process as described by Hmelo-Silver  (2004)  (see  Appendix).  It  is  worth  mentioning  that  the  PBL rubric was aligned with the SDL process described by Knowles (1975:18) where learners are 'formulating learning goals, identifying their resources, choosing and  implementing  appropriate  learning  strategies,  and  evaluating  learning outcomes'. During adaptation, the sections, recent literature, resources, data and  references  were  removed,  as  learners'  primary  sources  are  prescribed textbooks  approved  by  the  provincial  departments  of  education.  For  this research,  Golightly's  (2013)  assessment  rubric  was  adapted  as  follows: demarcation of the problem (4), formulation of learning objectives (12), the scope  and  quality  of  the  provisional  research  (20),  identification  and recommendation of possible solutions to the problem (20) and writing skills (4) (with a total mark of 60). Therefore, the highest score (maximum = 60) and the lowest score (minimum = 5) indicated the overall performance of the learner during the PBL activity. The continuum on which the scores fell is as follows:  Inefficient  -  unsatisfactory  (5-18.75),  efficient  -  fairly  acceptable (18.75-32.5),  good  -  moderately  satisfactory  (32.5-46.25)  and  excellent  highly satisfactory (46.25-60.0). Golightly's teacher-based assessment rubric was part of the portfolio. While coding and categorising the beginner teacher's

responses, emerging themes - which are outlined and discussed in 'Results and discussion' - were identified.

The assessment rubric for the PBL activity criteria scores was defined by four  quality  levels,  namely,  excellent,  good,  efficient  and  inefficient.  For instance, the criteria 'Demarcation of the problem' and 'Writing skills' each had a total score of 4 on the continuum, where 4 was excellent, 3 was good, 2 was  efficient  and  1  was  inefficient.  The  criterion  'Formulation  of  learning objectives'  had  a  total  weighting  score  of  12,  which  was  spread  on  the continuum as follows: 10-12 was excellent, 6-9 was good, 3-5 was efficient and  1-2  was  inefficient.  The  criteria  'The  scope  and  quality  of  provisional research' and 'Identification and recommendation of possible solutions for the problem'  both  had  a  total  weighting  score  of  20.  The  two  criteria  had  an excellent score (12-20) and a good score (11-15). For the criterion 'Scope and quality of provisional research', 6-10 weighting was efficient, while 1-5 was inefficient. For the criterion 'Identification and recommendation of possible solutions for the problem', efficient was defined by the score of 5-10, whereas an inefficient score range was 1-4.

In this research, trustworthiness of the data was ensured through an audit trail, which is a strategy for confirmability and credibility (Korstjens &amp; Moser 2018; Lincoln &amp; Guba 1985). The audit trail entailed providing a complete set of  notes  on  decisions  made  during  the  research  process,  research  team meetings, reflective thoughts, sampling, research materials adopted, emergence of the findings and information concerning the data management. Credibility refers to research participants' involvement in the research findings to ensure the results of the research are true or credible (Yilmaz 2013:320). In this research, the authors were involved in the field for a prolonged period, checked their interpretations with their participants and showed a process of learning. Confirmability means that the findings and the interpretations made from findings do not derive from the imagination or emotions of the researchers but  are  clearly  linked  to  the  generated  data  (Liamputtong  2013).  In  this research,  this  was  achieved  by  applying  SIT  -  themes  were  created  from theory  which  guided  the  analysis  and  discussion,  thereby  validating  the interpretations made from the findings. Also, verbatim quotations were used to support the data.

## Results and discussion

This section presents the results of the research and provides a discussion that  addresses  the  research  questions.  Firstly,  the  pre-TPD  results  and interpretations are provided. Secondly, the results are presented in the order in which the research questions were posed.

Exploring collaboration as a 21st-century skill to enhance self-directed learning

BOX 8.2: Beginner teacher's knowledge of the four concepts prior to the teacher professional development programme.

## Teaching approaches in teaching PNM

## Used approaches

Keobiditse responded as follows: 'LearnerCentred approach; Inductive approach; Participatory approach; Constructivist Learning approach.'

## Knowledge of PBL

Understanding of PBL

Keobiditse's own understanding of PBL was: 'Problem-Based Learning is a learner-centred approach in which learners attempt to learn a particular content through experience of solving a particular open-ended problem.'

Researchers' interpretation: Keobiditse's own definition of PBL was correct according the researchers' accepted definition of PBL based on PBL literature.

## Knowledge of 21st-century skills

21st-century skill(s) mentioned by the beginner teacher

Communication, critical thinking, creativity, technology literacy and problem-solving.

Other approaches, but not used

Keobiditse's response was: 'Teacher-centred approach; deductive approach.'

## Prior use of PBL

With regard to prior knowledge of using PBL, Keobiditse's response was: 'The knowledge I have is to request learners to state all material they consider to be matter and thereafter classify it in either liquid, solid or gas.'

This response showed that Keobiditse had no prior use of PBL.

21st-century skill(s) not mentioned by the beginner teacher

Collaboration

## Knowledge of SDL

Ways in which Keobiditse's learners exhibited SDL

Keobiditse's view: 'Positive thinking, commitment and punctuality, eagerness to learn and [solving] scientific problem(s) they were presented or confronted with'.

PNM, particulate nature of matter; TPD, teacher professional development; SDL, self-directed learning.

## Pre-teacher professional development results and interpretations

The  aim  of  the  open-ended  questionnaire  was  to  collect  data  that  would answer the research questions. The open-ended questionnaire results - based on four concepts, that is, teaching of PNM, knowledge of PBL, promotion of collaboration as a 21st-century skill and Keobiditse's enhancement of SDL were analysed before the TPD programme was presented. The researchers anticipated  that,  although  Keobiditse  might  have  had  an  understanding  of science CK, including PNM, his knowledge of teaching approach(es), including PBL, might have been limited. Consequently, data generation was based on the teaching of PNM.

Table 8.1 presents the four concepts that emerged from the open-ended questionnaire regarding the teaching approach(es) used and others known but not used by the beginner teacher to teach PNM in his Grade 10 Chemistry classroom. The beginner teacher's responses are presented verbatim.

TABLE 8.1: The themes associated with collaboration as a 21st-century skill.

| 21st-century skill   | Themes                                                               |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Collaboration        | •  Quality of the group process and outcome as a measure of success. |
|                      | •  Enhances SDL: Responsibility and evidence of interdependence.     |

SDL, self-directed learning.

Keobiditse's responses regarding this concept are, however, reported as no responses in this research, because they were not related to the information solicited. His responses were relatively broad. Regarding the concept of PBL in the open-ended  questionnaire,  Table  8.1 presents Keobiditse's own (verbatim) definition and indicates that he had no prior knowledge of using PBL  in  teaching  PNM.  Concerning  Keobiditse's  knowledge  of  21st-century skills, he mentioned five 21st-century skills (see Table 8.1) which were not the focus of this research. As shown in Table 8.1, he did not mention collaboration as a skill. Finally, as regards the last concept of SDL, Keobiditse mentioned ways in which his learners exhibited SDL (see Table 8.1).

Keobiditse mentioned what could not be identified as teaching approaches.  He  mentioned  broad  teaching  philosophy,  frameworks  and concepts  such  as  the constructivist  learning  approach and  the inductive approach . When asked to name other known teaching approaches that were introduced to them during their teacher training but were not utilised, none were mentioned, including PBL. It is difficult to explain this result. However, it was anticipated that the TPD programme would enhance and/or increase Keobiditse's knowledge  of  teaching  approaches,  especially PBL. The researchers anticipated that, although Keobiditse might have had relatively high science CK, including knowledge of PNM, he might have had limited knowledge  of  teaching  approach(es),  including  PBL.  The  open-ended questionnaire  was  rendered  to  establish  how  much  he  knew  about  PBL, informing the aspects that should be focused on by the facilitator during the intervention programme.

In the literature, no studies could be found on beginner physical sciences teachers'  knowledge  of  PBL.  As  shown  in  Table  8.1,  Keobiditse's  own understanding  of  PBL  was  correct  according  to  the  definition  of  PBL accepted in this research. Furthermore, Keobiditse's understanding of PBL as an open-ended, real-life problem that learners must solve using their own method  and  knowledge  (see  Table  8.1)  was  consistent  with  the  views  of many  scholars,  such  as  Abdullah  et  al.  (2019)  (Malaysia),  Akçay  (2009) (Turkey), Golightly (2020) (South Africa), Hüttel and Gnaur (2017) (Denmark) and Seleke et al. (2019) (South Africa). The definition adopted in this research is that PBL is a process whereby a group starts with a real-life or contentbased  ill-structured  problem  to  achieve  learning  objectives.  Furthermore, for the group to achieve the learning outcomes, group members must work

cooperatively (Johnson et al. 1995). The authors contend that, to solve a real-life problem cooperatively, learners should achieve the learning objectives  rather  than  simply  solving  the  problem.  This  PBL  definition comprises three components (i.e. problem-solving, cooperative learning and real-life problem), as was mentioned by Keobiditse (see Table 8.1).

As was anticipated, Keobiditse did not mention PBL under the teaching approaches and had never used PBL to teach. His lack of prior utilisation of PBL corroborates results  from  other  studies,  for  example,  De  Villiers  et  al. (2016) found that most of the 75 Life Sciences teachers who participated in their study had no prior knowledge of PBL and also did not use PBL in the past.  Therefore,  this  analysis  urged  that  emphasis  be  put  on  the  PBL implementation during the TPD programme, as Keobiditse was to implement PBL  in his physical sciences classroom. Keobiditse did not mention collaboration as a 21st-century skill. It is difficult to explain this result, but it might  be  related  to  the  fact  that,  as  there  are  many  21st-century  skills, Keobiditse only mentioned the first few that came to mind. Nonetheless, this finding  showed  a  need  to  emphasise  collaboration  as  a  21st-century  skill during the TPD programme.

As was mentioned in the literature review, the importance of collaboration as a skill (Al Kandari &amp; Al Qattan 2020; Collazos et al. 2007; Havenga 2018a; Stehle &amp; Peters-Burton 2019) was emphasised during the TPD programme. One of the questionnaire sections aimed to capture data on how Keobiditse promoted  SDL  and  how  his  learners  consequently  exhibited  SDL.  In  this regard,  the  results  of  this  research  showed  that  Keobiditse's  learners exhibited  SDL  through  'positive  thinking,  commitment  and  punctuality, eagerness to learn and solve scientific problem(s) they were presented or confronted with' (Table 8.1). This finding is not in line with that of Knowles (1975); however, Keobiditse's learners' eagerness to learn and solve scientific problem(s) is supported by Cheng et al. (2010). Nevertheless, this finding corroborates Sebotsa et al.'s (2019) argument that teachers are not familiar with the concept of SDL. It was therefore necessary to introduce the concept of  SDL  during  the  TPD  programme  and  to  show  corroboration  between Knowles' SDL process and teacher-based assessment rubric adapted from Golightly (2013).

During  the  TPD  intervention,  the  importance  of  collaboration  as  a  21stcentury skill for SDL (Turiman et al. 2019) was discussed. As was mentioned earlier, there are various ways for learners to exhibit SDL. The focus of the intervention workshop was on the utilisation of PBL. However, 21st-century skills, SDL and PNM content were emphasised. The PBL TPD programme was aligned with the needs of the teacher as per the open-ended questionnaire responses  of  the  participant  and  the  South  African  Physical  Sciences curriculum.

## How does a beginner physical sciences teacher's problem-based learning implementation enhance the development of collaboration as a 21st-century skill in learners for self-directed learning while teaching Particulate Nature of Matter?

The  participant's  portfolio  and  interview  responses  were  analysed  and grouped into a few themes relating to collaboration as a 21st-century skill. The researchers drew aspects from the SIT theoretical framework that underpinned this research and rephrased them as themes. During the interview, Keobiditse was asked to state PBL benefits for his learners. He said the following:

'PBL developed my learners' critical thinking and teamwork skills. Teamwork is an important skill to develop because, as science learners, they must know that … they will not work as individuals; many science careers require teamwork. Therefore, it is important for my learners to develop these skills while in school. Learners were able to show critical thinking, which is a good skill, which boosted their performance. These  are  skills  that  will  be  beneficial  for  the  real  world.'  (Keobiditse,  beginner physical sciences teacher, 11 March 2020)

During  the  interview,  Keobiditse  was  asked,  'How  could  you  tell  that  21stcentury skills were enhanced in your learners while utilising PBL?' He replied:

'Because  they  could  communicate  ideas,  thinking  critically  to  come  up  with solutions. And they were creative coming up with solutions. They also managed to work together cooperatively and complete the work successfully.' (Keobiditse, beginner physical sciences teacher, 11 March 2020)

Table 8.1 outlines two themes for collaboration as a 21st-century skill. The data are presented under these two themes.

One of the themes that emerged regarding collaboration as a 21st-century skill - enhancement brought about by SDL - was an indication of responsibility and evidence of interdependence among the learners to complete the task. Keobiditse's  responses  during  the  interview  reflected  that  learners  were responsible for their own learning and to work cooperatively as a group. The present findings seem to be consistent with those of Peen and Arshad (2017), who reported a relatively high occurrence of collaboration among learners, as they managed to complete their task. The results further showed that learners knew  and  encouraged  each  other's  strengths  to  do  quality  work.  In  this research,  the  findings  revealed  that  interdependent  collaboration  in  PBL enhanced self-directedness so that learners were responsible for their own learning and relied on one another as a PBL group rather than on the teacher. This finding echoes the argument by Stehle and Peters-Burton (2019), who stated  that  collaboration  enhances  SDL.  It  further  validates  the  finding  of Nursa'ban et al. (2019) that the implementation of PBL promotes SDL. The theme 'quality of the group process and outcome as a measure of success' is based on Keobiditse's response when asked to describe how he knew that

collaboration had been enhanced. This theme was further corroborated by the learners' achievement.

As was mentioned earlier, the teacher-based assessment rubric for the PBL activity (Golightly 2013) was used to assess learners during the implementation of  PBL.  Keobiditse  used  Golightly's  rubric  to  assess  his  learners'  work  on various aspects of PBL. To ensure reliability of the data, both authors also marked learners'  work  independently,  and  consensus  was  sought  for  each mark on each criterion. The average marks of the teacher-based assessment rubric are presented in Table 8.2.

Table 8.2 shows that Keobiditse's learners were awarded a mark of 3 for 'Demarcation of the problem' and 'Writing skills', suggesting that they were good.  His  learners  were  considered  to  be  efficient  with  a  mark  of  5  for 'Formulation  of  learning  objectives'.  Formulation  of  learning  objectives  is also mentioned in the SDL process (Knowles 1975). This result shows that collaboration  during  the  implementation  of  PBL  enhanced  SDL.  With reference  to  the  criterion  'The  scope  and  quality  of  provisional  research', Table 8.2 indicates that Keobiditse's learners scored an average mark of 18 (excellent). This criterion is also found in the SDL process. Concerning the criterion  'Identification  and  recommendation  of  possible  solutions  for  the problem',  Keobiditse's  learners  were  deemed  excellent,  with  an  average mark of 14. This criterion is also found in the SDL process described by both Knowles (1975) and Cheng et al. (2010). Finally, as was mentioned earlier, the total weighting of the PBL activity equates to 60 marks. As shown in Table 8.2, Keobiditse's learners were good at completing the task and presenting their  solutions  in  a  professionally  written  manner.  The  learners  could successfully complete the task, provide solutions and make recommendations for the problem. The learners' overall performance was good, with an average overall score of 43.

The  results  of  this  research  show  that,  during  PBL  implementation,  the following are logical inferences and conclusions: learners can work together

to find answers before they can be guided; PBL promotes learner interdependency; learners rely more on themselves as a group than on the teacher;  and  learners  acquire  interdependency,  which  is  how  most  science careers function in the real world. These inferences and conclusions are based on the teacher participant's perceptions about learners during the implementation of PBL.

The findings of this research corroborate the findings of previous work in this  field  advocating  for  the  implementation  of  PBL  in  sciences  education (Nursa'ban et al. 2019; Thakur et al.  2018;  Valdez  &amp;  Bungihan  2019).  Furthermore, in line with Sekarini et al. (2020) and Thakur et al. (2018), this research suggests that  the  implementation  of  PBL  provides  an  effective  learning  model  that could be used in developing collaboration as a 21st-century skill.

## What are the beginner physical sciences teacher's challenges, if any, when implementing problem-based learning to enhance the development of collaboration as a 21st-century skill in learners for self-directed learning while teaching Particulate Nature of Matter?

Some  of  the  challenges  mentioned  by  Keobiditse  in  his  portfolio  were discomfort using an unusual approach and correcting a learner in a group in such a way that the learner is not embarrassed:

'When learners were working in groups and I wanted to correct or motivate one learner, I had to do it in a manner that does not embarrass him/her. Sometimes one learner has a misconception, it is difficult to clear it in a way that is 'civil' and encouraging such that, that learner understands that he/she is wrong but also know that it is okay to be wrong; this was a challenge.' (Keobiditse, beginner physical sciences teacher, 11 March 2020)

Keobiditse was uncomfortable implementing PBL in his chemistry classroom. It is difficult to explain this finding. However, this might have been because of Keobiditse being new to teaching (see Van Heerden 2019) and having to face some  challenges  such  as  personnel,  organisations  and  environments  (see Robson &amp; Mtika 2017).

One interesting finding that emerged from this research was that Keobiditse struggled to find positive ways to correct and clear a learner's misconceptions without embarrassing them in front of other group members. This might be related  to  the  kind  of  person  the  teacher  was  or  the  kind  of  learners  the teacher  had,  because  he  knew  them  better.  It  is  also  possible  that  a  PBL approach can be affected by the size of the class - larger class sizes might experience challenges in implementing a PBL approach and achieving desired outcomes (Valdez &amp; Bungihan 2019). The challenges identified in this research are not new to the field but are well known to both beginner and experienced teachers across disciplines in education.

## Conclusion

Before the TPD programme, Keobiditse had limited knowledge of teaching using  PBL.  Furthermore,  he  demonstrated  an  acceptable  understanding  of PBL.  As  regards  Keobiditse's  knowledge  of  21st-century  skills,  he  did  not mention collaboration. In line with Dudu (2014) and Lee and Blanchard (2019), it was found that TPD may enhance teachers' knowledge and implementation of PBL to promote collaboration as a 21st-century skill for SDL. After a TPD programme,  while  teaching PNM,  Keobiditse's implementation  of PBL enhanced the development of collaboration as a 21st-century skill for SDL in learners.  However,  he  did  experience  some  challenges  in  this  regard.  It  is recommended that intervention programmes be presented to enable teachers to improve their skills in implementing PBL in the Physical Sciences classroom.

## Abstract

The development of SDL skills relies heavily on the ability of individuals to assess  and  prioritise  their  learning  needs.  Self-directed  learning  skills  are important for the development of competent mathematics teachers who can adapt  to  various  situations.  In  this  chapter,  I  explore  the  effects  of  using geometry multiple-solution tasks (MSTs) on pre-service mathematics teachers' SDL  and  their  competency  in  solving  geometry  problems  using  multiple-

solutions task questions (MSTQs). Data were collected by means of Williamson's Self-rating Scale for Self-directed Learning (SRSSDL) Questionnaire, a MSTQs instrument and semi-structured interviews. Results from the SRSSDL Questionnaire showed that the intervention was successful in increasing the SDL of students with an initially moderate SDL score compared to those with an initially  high  SDL  score.  Furthermore,  the  results  revealed  that  students with an initially high SDL score were more competent in solving geometry problems compared to students with an initially moderate SDL score. From these results, it can be inferred that there is a close connection between SDL and one's problem-solving capabilities. Overall, the intervention had educational importance, especially on students with an initially moderate SDL score. Some of the implications of the findings on both mathematics teacher education and the scholarship of SDL are discussed.

## Introduction

The assessment of teacher knowledge is of paramount importance in both teacher training institutions and professional development courses because it helps  to  evaluate  their  CK  competency,  which  has  implications  for  their classroom practice (Shulman 1986). Teacher knowledge also influences their attitudes towards mathematics and its pedagogy (Ernest 1989). Studies have shown that teachers' mathematical knowledge is positively associated with learner achievement (Hill &amp; Chin 2018; Hill, Rowan &amp; Ball 2005), even though the  nature  and  extent  of  the  exact  teacher  knowledge  influencing  learner achievement  are  largely  unknown  (Ball,  Thames  &amp;  Phelps  2008).  Solving mathematical problems in different ways can be in contention in this regard. Mathematics teacher knowledge is also important in noticing and supporting learners' mathematical thinking (Hill &amp; Chin 2018), which enhances the learning process (Schoenfeld 2017). Similarly, facilitators' 23  knowledge of their students' (prospective teachers) CK can help them to support students' development of  CK  and  problem-solving  (Chick  &amp;  Beswick  2018).  Therefore,  assessing pre-service  student  teachers'  (PSTs)  knowledge  of  problem-solving  as  a component of mathematics teaching and learning is justified.

Multiple-solution  tasks  are  promising  teaching  and  learning  tools  given that they reveal and enhance PSTs' mathematical problem-solving competency (Guberman &amp; Leikin 2013). Multiple-solution tasks, amongst others, can be used to reveal one's connectedness of mathematical knowledge (Polya 1973; Schoenfeld 1994), differentiate between PSTs who belong to high and regularlevel teaching (Levav-Waynberg &amp; Leikin 2012), enhance their proficiency in problem-solving  (Leikin  &amp;  Elgrably  2020),  expertise  in  teaching  (Leikin  &amp;

Levav-Waynberg 2007) and reveal how teachers facilitate learning in their classrooms (Leikin 2011). Furthermore, the requirement of multiple solutions to  mathematical problems allows problem-solvers to express their creative solutions and exercise independent thinking (Leikin et al. 2013). The originality in  the  solutions  presented  by  problem  solvers  during  the  production  of multiple solutions is evidence that they have identified strategies, knowledge connections and resources required to solve the problem. Furthermore, the requirement of multiple solutions as a mathematical challenge to PSTs allows them to be less reliant on facilitators (Ingram et al. 2020). Schukajlow and Krug (2013, 2014) have also shown that the requirement of multiple solutions can enhance students' metacognition and self-regulation. The requirement of multiple solutions to mathematical problems is not a requirement in South African basic and HE. Hence, the production of multiple solutions to geometry problems is an activity that can encourage students to be more self-directed in  their  learning.  Despite  several  benefits  of  incorporating  MSTs  in  teacher education,  no  empirical  study  was  found  in  the  South  African  context investigating this practice. Furthermore, the effects of incorporating MSTs in PSTs' courses on their SDL have never been investigated globally. This provided a rationale for conducting this study with PSTs enrolled in a geometry module at one South African university.

## Problem statement

During their practice, teachers continually engage with learners of different capabilities and learning needs. Some learners produce creative solutions that deviate from the usual solutions produced by other learners in the classroom (Mhlolo  2017).  There  is  evidence  that  mathematics  PSTs  usually  compute different solutions to the same problem in their classroom - some use different methods to obtain the same answers, and some misrepresent mathematical information which could lead to incorrect answers (Mhlolo 2017). Hence, there is  a  need  for  facilitators  who  cannot  only  present  mathematics  in  multiple ways to cater for PSTs' different needs but also equip PSTs with multiple ways of solving mathematical problems. Furthermore, Schoenfeld (2016:22) stressed that 'teachers must perceive implications of the students' different approaches, whether they may be fruitful, if not, what might make them so'. The main challenge, as observed in research by Leikin et al. (2013) and Mhlolo (2017), is that when PSTs produce these creative solutions, most facilitators fear entering the unknown domain and dismiss these solutions without giving them any consideration. In such a case, facilitators need to be cognisant of multiple  solutions  and  able  to  differentiate  between  correct  and  incorrect solutions. Furthermore, facilitators need to be able to perform error analyses to  either  support  or  build  from  it  when  facilitating  PSTs'  mathematical development (Ball, Hill &amp; Bass 2005). This means that facilitators themselves need to be able to produce multiple solutions to mathematical problems. This

need is exacerbated by the recognition that work-related problems usually involve  multiple  pathways  to  finding  a  solution,  which  means  that  workers must also be competent in exploring different avenues to find solutions to problems (Jang 2016). Studies have indicated that facilitators do not value multiple  solutions  in  mathematics  classrooms,  and  they  have  difficulty  in grading learners' different solutions (Bingolbali 2011; Mhlolo 2017). Notwithstanding  such  findings,  some  facilitators  value  the  production  of multiple  solutions  in  mathematics  and  vow  that  such  solutions  should  be included in the school curriculum and the training of mathematics teachers (Stupel &amp; Ben-Chaim 2017). In a recent study, challenging tasks 24  were used to facilitate  mathematics  learning  in  New  Zealand,  and  findings  suggest  that challenging tasks developed learners' autonomy, as they were seen to be less reliant on the teacher when solving problems after the intervention (Ingram et al. 2020), hinting at the development of some self-direction in the learners. Hence, producing multiple solutions to mathematical problems can be thought of as an activity that can emancipate students from depending on teachers for  solutions.  The  requirement  of  multiple  solutions  to  geometry  problems provides  an  extra  load  for  PSTs  to  search  for  more  information  than  they normally would if they were asked for just one solution, which transforms the task from being routine to a challenging task.

As an imperative for the 21st century, SDL is one factor that is important when producing multiple solutions to mathematical problems because this activity requires resilience and autonomy from problem solvers (Guglielmino 2013; Ingram et al. 2020). Furthermore, the activity of looking for multiple solutions means that PSTs have to continually reflect on the problem and use their  past  experiences,  knowledge  and  problem-solving  strategies  to  find different approaches to the solution of the problem (Schoenfeld 1994). Hence, PSTs need to continually reassess their learning needs, set new goals and find learning strategies and materials that could help them to achieve the set goals. In this chapter, I present empirical evidence of PSTs' experiences during the activity of finding multiple solutions to geometry tasks and how it affected their SDL. The study also aimed to assess PSTs' competency in finding multiple solutions for five specific geometry problems. I aim to answer the following research questions in this chapter:

- · How does solving MSTs display PSTs' proficiency in geometry problemsolving?
- · What are the SDL benefits of computing multiple solutions to geometry problems in a remote learning environment for pre-service mathematics teachers?

24. Challenging tasks require 'students to connect different aspects of mathematics together, to devise solution strategies for themselves and to explore more than one pathway to solutions' (Sullivan et al. 2013).

## Theoretical and conceptual framework What are multiple-solution tasks in mathematics?

In mathematics, MSTs are mathematical problems that afford opportunities to problem solvers to solve using different methods. They can be characterised as  similar  to  Leikin  and  Levav-Waynberg's  (2008)  connecting  tasks  that contain a directive to produce multiple solutions. Multiple-solution tasks are different  from  tasks  that  have  multiple  answers.  They  can  be  solved  using different strategies  including  different  representations  on  mathematical concepts, different properties, theorems or definitions, and different branches of mathematics to obtain the same answer (Leikin &amp; Levav-Waynberg 2008), whereas tasks with different answers once solved produce different answers that are all mathematically correct.

## Solution spaces in multiple-solution tasks

In  finding multiple solutions to mathematical problems, Leikin and LevavWaynberg (2008) proposed the notion of solution spaces, which refers to a group  of  all  solutions  to  problems  that  can  be  computed  by  individuals, groups or experts in a particular domain. They refer to these solution spaces as  individual,  collective  and  expert  solution  spaces.  Of  the  three  solution spaces, the most complete one is an expert solution space , which represents all  solutions  to  a  particular  problem  known  by  a  particular  professional mathematician (Leikin &amp; Levav-Waynberg 2008; Levav-Waynberg &amp; Leikin 2012). The second most complete solution space is the collective solution space ,  which  represents  the  set  of  all  solutions  produced  by  a  group  of people working together (Leikin &amp; Levav-Waynberg 2008; Levav-Waynberg &amp; Leikin 2012). This solution space supports individuals in producing their own solutions to mathematical problems (Leikin &amp; Levav-Waynberg 2008); hence, it expands individual solution spaces. Lastly, the individual solution space presents all the solutions produced by an individual without the aid of another person and the solutions that individuals produce with the help of others through the process of what Wood, Bruner and Ross (1976) coined as scaffolding through the zone of proximal development (Vygotsky 1978). The solution  produced  by  an  individual  independently  is  referred  to  as  an available  solution ,  while  one  produced  by  an  individual  with  the  help  of others is a potential solution (Levav-Waynberg &amp; Leikin 2012). Individual and collective  solution  spaces  are  a  subset  of  expert  solution  spaces  and  are affected by each individual's problem-solving experiences and tasks requirements (Leikin &amp; Levav-Waynberg 2008). In this study, I only focused on PSTs' individual solution spaces.

## Why produce multiple solutions to mathematical problems?

A consortium of mathematics teachers approves that mathematics teaching, amongst other things, should ensure that learners develop connections that would allow them to recognise that different approaches to the same problem can  yield  similar  solutions  (National  Council  of  Teachers  of  Mathematics [NCTM] 2000). One of the key abilities indicating conceptual understanding of  mathematics  is  to  represent  mathematical  concepts  in  different  forms, which is interconnected with the ability to employ different approaches to solving mathematical problems (Even 1998). There is emphasis that learners' development of mathematical thinking and problem-solving rests upon the teacher's ability to integrate multiple representations of mathematical concepts into the classroom (Tall 1988, 1991; Tall &amp; Vinner 1981). Polya (1973) asserted  that  proficient  and  experienced  mathematics  teachers  can  solve mathematical problems in multiple ways. Polya (1973:61) further stressed that asking  questions  such  as  'can  you  derive  the  result  differently'  can  drive students to reach more elegant and simpler solutions. Moreover, producing multiple  solutions  to  mathematical  problems  contributes  to  facilitators' mathematical thinking and creativity in the subject (Leikin &amp; Levav-Waynberg 2008; Silver 1997; Stupel &amp; Ben-Chaim 2017). Hence, teachers are continually encouraged to teach their learners to use multiple representations in their mathematics  learning  (NCTM  2000).  Engaging  in  MSTs  affords  learners opportunities to make  connections between  different problem-solving strategies, thus developing their mathematical thinking (Stein &amp; Smith 1998; Tekkumru-Kisa, Stein &amp; Doyle 2020).

Multiple representations of mathematical knowledge have been shown to enhance problem-solving repertoire through supporting different idea processes, promoting deeper learning, constraining interpretations (Ainsworth et  al.  1997;  Rau  &amp;  Matthews  2017),  promoting  CK  and  expanding  teachers' solution spaces (Guberman &amp; Leikin 2013; Leikin &amp; Levav-Waynberg 2008). Furthermore,  engaging  in  the  activity  of  producing  multiple  solutions  to mathematical  problems  facilitates  the  development  of  complex  problemsolving, a most desired skill in the 21st century (Jang 2016). Finding multiple solutions further shows the interconnectedness of the different sub-domains of  mathematics, like  how  a  geometry  problem can be solved using trigonometry or even complex numbers (Schoenfeld 1994; Silver et al. 2005), and enhances learners' interest, autonomy and competence in the number of solutions they produce  (Schukajlow  &amp;  Krug  2014). Furthermore, MSTs  are useful in strengthening  procedural  fluency  and  conceptual  understanding  (Große  &amp; Renkl  2006),  which  are  two  significant  strands  of  indicting  a  leap  in mathematical proficiency (eds. Kilpatrick, Swafford &amp; Findell 2001). Employing MSTs in the classroom promotes classroom engagement where productive discourse becomes a prominent part of the teaching and learning process

(Stupel  &amp;  Ben-Chaim  2017).  Producing  multiple  solutions  also  enhances students' self-regulation in their learning and performance in mathematical problem-solving  (Schukajlow,  Krug  &amp;  Rakoczy  2015),  which  points  to  the possibility that producing multiple-solution may enhance SDL. Exploring PSTs' abilities to produce multiple solutions to mathematical problems is useful, as it  allows  for  the  identification  of  their  specific  CK  needs  (Dreher, Kuntze &amp; Lerman 2016), hence affording teacher trainers an opportunity to support this knowledge before they graduate to teach mathematics.

## Some dangers of employing multiple-solution tasks in mathematics teaching and learning

Just like any other task that provides problem solvers with a higher cognitive demand, MSTs might pose several dangers to learning in the classroom if not handled  with  care.  Different  solutions  to  mathematical  problems  place different cognitive demands on problem solvers (Stein &amp; Smith 1998). Even though students who engage in high cognitive demand tasks perform better than their counterparts involved in lower cognitive demands tasks (Silver &amp; Stein 1996), the process of facilitating these tasks is crucial. Facilitators are warned not to pose mathematical problems that discourage learners from learning but to pose problems that are challenging but accessible for learners to solve. Mathematical problems should be posed at the appropriate Grade level  of  learners  and  should  be  posed  in  such  a  way  that  they  stimulate learners'  curiosity.  Hence,  facilitating  teaching  and  learning  through  high cognitive demand tasks requires the kind of scaffolding that allows learners to participate in classroom discourse and gives them the autonomy to express their  curiosity  (Sullivan  et  al.  2014).  Several  studies  provide  reasons  why utilising multiple representations of understanding the content in education is advantageous, while also warning that these representations need to be handled with care as they can inhibit learning if misused (Ainsworth 2008; Bamberger 2014; Chang, Cromley &amp; Tran 2016). These studies particularly warn  against  using  representation  that  might  not  have  relevance  in  the mathematical domain (Duval 2006). The activity of finding multiple solutions can derail the learning process and can drive learners to focus on a certain part of mathematical knowledge instead of the whole domain of mathematics; Große and Renkl (2006) warned that this activity can add extra cognitive load on learners, which can inhibit learning. Furthermore, Schukajlow et al. (2015) suggested that employing only MSTs in the classroom is not as useful as employing MSTs together with teacher scaffolds in cooperative learning groups  and  compared  these  within  the  whole  class.  During  this  activity, facilitators  should  notice  and  discourage  passive  behaviour  from  learners who  only  observe  other  learners  or  the  facilitator  producing  solutions, because they would not improve their mathematical knowledge and problemsolving (Schukajlow et al. 2015).

## Why focus on geometry?

International tests have conclusively presented evidence that South African learners  perform  very  poorly  in  mathematics  when  compared  to  their counterparts from other countries (Reddy et al. 2016). Euclidean geometry is a mathematics sub-domain of the South African curriculum that has been identified as challenging not only for learners but for teachers as well (Luneta 2014; Naidoo &amp; Kapofu 2020; Van Putten, Stols &amp; Howie 2010). After analysing the readiness of Grade 10 learners for Euclidean geometry, Alex and Mammen (2014) concluded that a majority of the Grade 10 learners in their sample were at Van Hiele Level 0, implying that they were not ready to deal with Euclidean geometry-related content. Luneta (2015) analysed 1000 Grade 12 learners' examinations scripts and found that learners made basic conceptual mistakes when answering geometry questions, and a majority of them were operating at Van Hiele Level 2 instead of Level 3. In a recent study, most Grade 11 female learners deemed Euclidean geometry difficult and confusing, and they said that they tended to memorise geometry theorems without making any links  to  geometry  problem-solving  (Naidoo  &amp;  Kapofu  2020). Despite numerous suggestions for improvement given by the Department of Basic Education (DoBE), this poor performance continues to soar, and there is no sign of improvement yet (DoBE 2019). This is a cause for concern for the mathematics education fraternity given that the applications of Euclidean geometry are vast. Even though there is a plethora of factors that may affect learners' struggle in geometry, in this chapter, I focus on teacher knowledge, as  teachers  are  in  the  front  line  of  ensuring  learners'  development  in geometry.

In addition to focusing on teacher knowledge, I have also uncovered that most teachers struggle with mathematical content that relates to geometry. Van  der  Sandt  and  Nieuwoudt  (2003)  reported  that  most  South  African mathematics teachers are not properly trained to teach Euclidean geometry proficiently.  Later,  they  provided  evidence  that  PSTs'  geometry  knowledge deteriorated throughout  their training, indicating that teacher training programmes do not maintain nor improve PSTs' geometry knowledge (Van der Sandt &amp; Nieuwoudt 2005). After using Usiskin's Cognitive Development and Achievement in Secondary School Geometry and follow-up interviews, Van Putten et al. (2010) also concluded that many mathematics teachers were not  well  equipped  to  teach  Euclidean  geometry  during  their  training. Observations  made  by  Atebe  and  Schäfer  (2011)  indicate  that  teaching methods used in South African classrooms afford learners limited opportunities to learn Euclidean geometry effectively. A study conducted by Luneta (2014) has also shown that first-year students who enrolled for a Foundation Phase teaching degree operated at Van Hiele Level 1 of geometrical thinking while they were expected to complete their Grade 12 operating at Van Hiele Level 3.

These PSTs take their poor geometry knowledge to their classroom practice, which leads to them delivering poor geometry lessons to learners and directly contributing  to  the  rising  poor  performance  in  geometry-related  problems observed  in  previous  diagnostic  reports  of  Grade  12  examinations  (DoBE 2019). This poor performance in geometry and lack of conceptual understanding observed in learners and teachers mean that they need to be offered different learning opportunities in their mathematics classrooms. This situation presupposes the need to train PSTs intensively in Euclidean geometryrelated  content  and  scaffolding  their  facilitation  of  effective  mathematics classrooms. I also focused on Euclidean geometry in this chapter because it is a field populated by the possibility of developing MSTs that can be used by teachers  to  deepen  learners'  mathematical  problem-solving  and  understanding. As  Stupel  and  Ben-Chaim  (2017)  asserted,  Euclidean  geometry  provides teachers with a goldmine of MSTs where various approaches and methods ranging  from  geometrical,  algebraic  or  trigonometric,  vector  and  complex numbers - can be used to find the solution.

## Teacher knowledge

I see problem-solving as the centre of developing mathematical knowledge, amongst others. Hence, I hold that students should be afforded opportunities to solve problems in more than one way to develop proficiency in problemsolving (Silver et al. 2005). In conceptualising teacher knowledge, Shulman (1986) identified three categories, namely, CK, pedagogical content knowledge  (PCK)  and  knowledge  of  curriculum  (Hill  &amp;  Lubienski  2007; Shulman 1986). However, this chapter primarily focuses on PSTs' problemsolving of MSTs, which mainly relates to their CK. Content knowledge focuses on the knowledge in teachers' minds which encapsulates not only factual mathematical knowledge but also conceptual knowledge and knowledge of multiple representations of mathematical knowledge (NCTM 2000; Shulman 1986). Content knowledge is important for mathematics teachers to facilitate deeper learning from multiple perspectives and nurture learners with multiple mathematical problem-solving strategies. I consider the ability to produce multiple  solutions  to  mathematical  problems  an  integral  part  of  teacher knowledge. Focusing on facilitators' CK is important because it is the most integral part of teaching mathematics, and the provision of multiple solutions is reliant on the interconnectedness of facilitators' CK. Facilitators' CK comes in handy when facilitating lessons to develop learners' abilities to produce unanticipated  solutions  and  is  the  centre  of  judging  whether  learners' solutions are correct or contain misconceptions or errors (Silver et al. 2005). The ability to produce multiple solutions to mathematical problems can be seen  as  an  attribute  of  proficiency  in  mathematical  problem-solving  (eds. Kilpatrick et al. 2001).

## Conclusion: Conceptualising multiple-solution tasks in self-directed learning

In Chapter 1, Knowles' definition of SDL is presented and operationalised. Selfdirected learning holds benefits for learning and is relevant to 21st-century education. Notable from the conceptualisation of SDL by Knowles (1975) are the  main  characteristics  that  reveal  students'  SDL,  like  taking  initiative  for their  own  learning.  Self-directed  learners  also  exhibit  signs  of  'curiosity, initiative, persistence, independence, discipline, and self-motivation' in their learning  (Van  der  Walt  2016:3-4)  and  are  likely  to  attempt  challenging problems that require a high level of problem-solving during their learning (Banerjee 2011; Guglielmino, Guglielmino &amp; Long 1987). Motivation to learn is also one characteristic that can foster SDL in students (Mentz &amp; Van Zyl 2018). What is  critical  to  consider  in  the  conceptualisation  of  SDL  is  the  level  of autonomy given to problem solvers to follow their individualised approach to finding a solution to a certain problem.

Furthermore, I have highlighted and operationalised the definition of MSTs in mathematics education and problem-solving. It is clear from research on MSTs  that  problem  solvers  can  be  taught  different  strategies  of  solving  a problem in multiple ways, but one cannot teach all problem-solving strategies to  problem  solvers,  because  there  is  a  plethora  of  mathematical  problems that  can  be  solved  in  multiple  ways.  Hence,  for  problem  solvers  to  solve mathematical problems in multiple ways, they need to be able to assess their knowledge (or strategy) limitations to solving a particular problem and devise their own learning methods to overcome these limitations and allow them to solve the problem. A PBL environment is a good example of such a practice, except that the mathematical problem posed as an MST can be an abstract mathematical  problem  instead  of  a  real-life  problem.  Also,  the  method  of learning  does  not  always  have  to  be  facilitated  by  a  more  knowledgeable other. Problem-based learning has been shown to improve problem solvers' SDL (Barrows 1986; Hmelo-Silver 2004) and the activities of searching for multiple  solutions  to  mathematics  problems  can  be  considered  as  an  SDL enterprise undertaken by problem solvers.

South African learners are not required to produce multiple solutions to mathematical problems, even in their high school years, but there is evidence that the mathematical problems they encounter in their learning can be solved in  multiple  ways.  Hence,  the  requirement  of  multiple  solutions  from  them means that they have to go beyond their usual problem-solving activities and find other different strategies to solve the problem and get the same answer. This going beyond means that they need to identify what they must learn, devise methods of learning what they must learn from different resources and apply  what  they  have  learnt  to  find  multiple  solutions  to  given  problems (Ingram et al. 2020). This is close to the characteristics of SDL operationalised

by Knowles (1975), which means that the requirement of multiple solutions to mathematical  problems  can  be  regarded  as  an  SDL  activity  for  problem solvers  because  they  need  to  manoeuvre  ways  in  which  they  can  find  the solution to the problem. Problem solvers must be intrinsically motivated to want to solve the problem instead of relying on external incentives, because even though multiple solutions are required, once a problem solver finds one solution, they can decide to give up. Garrison's (1997) idea of 'collaborative constructivism' is important, as problem solvers might decide to seek help from more knowledgeable others in their remote environments, positioning knowledge not only as personally constructed but also as socially constructed. This activity of locating and seeking help from others is characterised as an SDL competency and is therefore  important  to  consider  as  a  predictor  of problem solvers' SDL (Knowles 1975).

## Empirical investigation

The aim of this chapter is to explore PSTs' experiences of finding multiple solutions  to  Euclidean  geometry  problems  and  how  this  exercise  affected their SDL.

## Research design

This  interpretive  study  followed  a  mixed-methods  design.  Both  qualitative and  quantitative  data  were  collected  on  PSTs'  experiences  of  computing multiple solutions to geometry problems and how this affected their SDL. For the quantitative part of the study, the design of the study was structured to contain a pre-test, an intervention and a post-test. Students had to complete a  questionnaire  for  the  pre-  and  post-tests.  The  intervention  required  that students  produce  multiple  solutions  to  the  given  geometry  problems  and submit to the lecturer on a weekly basis. It was compulsory that students produced the multiple solutions to geometry problems (intervention) as these were part of the module outcomes, but completing the pre- and post-test questionnaires was voluntary. Thereafter, for the qualitative part of the study, a  sample  of  the  participants  completed  an  MST  and  participated  in  semistructured interviews.

## The module

The participants in this study were third-year PSTs from a selected university in  South  Africa  who  were  enrolled  for  a  module  focusing  on  Euclidean geometry.  In  this  module,  PSTs  were  trained  on  both  the  CK  of  Euclidean geometry and its didactics thereof. One of the module's sub-aims is to promote PSTs' production of multiple solutions to geometry problems, and hence, the students engaging in this module were suited for this study. During a period

of 12 weeks, PSTs were required to come up with different solutions to different geometry  problems  as  part  of  the  module  outcomes.  The  module  was presented  in  a  remote  learning  environment,  where  teaching  and  learning occurred on Sakai, the university data management system called eFundi. In order to assess PSTs' individual multiple-solutions spaces, they were given tasks in which they were required to produce multiple solutions and submit them to the researcher. The efforts to produce multiple solutions were from individual students consulting any source that could help them find different solutions  to  the  problem.  The  module  encapsulates  geometry  content indicative of Grade 12 content from CAPS and beyond.

## Participants

Prior  to  the  commencement  of  the  intervention,  an  independent  person recruited PSTs to participate in the study. Pre-service student teachers had to complete  a  consent  form.  Thirty-two  PSTs  completed  and  submitted  the consent  form,  indicating  their  willingness  to  voluntarily  participate  in  this study.  Upon  finalisation  of  the  module  marks,  a  sample  of  three  PSTs  was purposefully  selected  from  the  32  participants  and  was  approached  to complete  the  MSTQs  and  participate  in  semi-structured  interviews.  These three participants were selected based on their dominant participation in and contribution to the production of multiple solutions during the intervention.

## The intervention

The  intervention  was  designed  as  part  of  the  module  outcomes  for  the Euclidean  geometry  module  which  entailed  the  production  of  multiple solutions to geometry problems. As part of this outcome, PSTs were required to produce multiple solutions to different geometry problems, handpicked by the lecturer, based on their affordances and opportunities to produce multiple solutions. This was done as an individual activity which contained different problems where PSTs were required to individually compute multiple solutions on  a  weekly  basis.  The  arrangement  was  that  on  the  first  Friday  of  the beginning of the semester, PSTs would be given their first task, which would be due the following Friday, and the same cycle continued for a period of 12 weeks.

## Methods of data collection

In this study, PSTs were required to complete Williamson's (2007) SRSSDL Questionnaire before and after the intervention in order to measure the impact of the intervention on their SDL. This questionnaire was chosen because its reliability has been verified from different contexts and in both students and workers (Cadorin et al. 2011; Golightly &amp; Brockett 2010; Mentz &amp; Van Zyl 2016). Both  descriptive  analysis  and  inferential  statistical  analysis  were  used  to

analyse the data from the SRSSDL Questionnaire. After the intervention, three participants completed a task with five geometry problems where they were required to produce multiple solutions. Thereafter, they participated in a semistructured interview where they had to share their experiences of computing multiple solutions to geometry problems. This was done in order to elaborate on the results obtained from the SRSSDL Questionnaire. The questions from the  semi-structured  interview  schedule  focused  on  two  major  themes addressed in this chapter: the production of multiple solutions and PSTs' SDL. The transcripts  of  the  semi-structured  interviews  with  PSTs  were  analysed using open data-driven coding 25  (DeCuir-Gunby, Marshall &amp; McCulloch 2011) to  identify  codes  that  related  to  PSTs'  experiences  of  computing  multiple solutions and their SDL. Both the task sheet submitted by the participants and the interview transcripts formed part of the data sources for this study.

## Instruments

The study involved three research instruments - Williamsons' SRSSDL, task sheets  for  participants  to  produce  multiple  solutions  and  semi-structured interviews.

## Quantitative data: The self-rating scale for self-directed learning

The  SRSSDL  Questionnaire  was  designed  for  individuals  to  rate  different elements  related  to  their  self-direction  in  their  learning.  The  questionnaire comprises 60 items that are categorised under five broad areas of SDL, namely: awareness, learning strategies, learning activities, evaluation and interpersonal skills (Williamson 2007). Pre-service student teachers responded to each of the 60 questions in the questionnaire through a five-point Likert scale. This scale showed PSTs' frequency of performing a certain task indicated by the statements of the 60 questions in the SRSSDL. In this five-point Likert scale, the numbers 1 to 5 indicated the following frequencies: 1 = never, 2 = seldom, 3 = sometimes, 4 = often and 5 = often. In SRSSDL, a lowest score of 60 and a highest score of 300 can be obtained, and a score ranging from 60 to 140 is regarded  as  an  indication  of  a  low  level  of  SDL,  141-220  as  moderate  and 221-300 as high (Williamson 2007). Most importantly, the finding that all five broad areas of SDL in SRSSDL upon validation studies by Williamson (2007) recorded a Cronbach's coefficient above 0.70 indicated that this questionnaire is reliable. Another Italian validation study that evaluated the SDL of 334 nurses using the SRSSDL and obtained a Pearson coefficient of 0.73, which indicated good reliability and Cronbach's alpha coefficient of 0.94, indicated that the

SRSSDL had internal consistency (Cadorin et al. 2011). In South Africa, Mentz and Van Zyl (2016) measured the SDL of 57 CAT first-year teachers' SDL and found that  the  SRSSDL  is  also  reliable  in  the  South  African  context  with  a Cronbach's alpha coefficient  of  0.83.  The  validity  and  reliability  Cronbach's score for this study is reported on in the findings of this study.

## Qualitative data: The multiple-solution task questions

Data were also collected through an MSTQ task sheet containing five geometry problems.  Three  participants  had  to  compute  multiple  solutions  to  the problems. A total of 13 solutions to these five problems were possible. These geometry  problems  were  chosen  because  they  bore  the  characteristic  of many  geometry  problems  -  the  ability  to  afford  problem  solvers  the opportunity to compute multiple solutions.

## Qualitative data: Semi-structured interviews

Interviews  are  the  dominant  tool  for  collecting  qualitative  data  in  social sciences  research.  They  allowed  the  interviewer  to  probe  participants' experiences that could not be revealed by psychometric tests or a problemsolving task. In this study, the semi-structured interviews allowed for a further probing of PSTs' experiences of computing multiple solutions to geometry problems in the module and the MST. Furthermore, the interviews also allowed me to capture participants' SDL experiences that might have been the result of  engaging  in  the  intervention.  The  interview  data  provided  an  extensive elaboration of the data collected by means of the SRSSDL and the MST.

## Ethical issues

Permission  to  conduct  the  study  was  granted  by  the  university  where  the study  was  conducted.  Students  signed  a  consent  form,  indicating  their voluntary participation in completing the SRSSDL Questionnaire and also the semi-structured  interviews.  The  consent  form  assured  students  that  their identities would be protected through the use of pseudonyms, that they could discontinue  their  participation  whenever  they  wished  to  do  so  and  that withdrawal from the study would not affect them in any way. To ensure that participation in the study did not affect students' marks in the module, data (MSTQs  and  interviews)  were  collected  after  the  module  marks  had  been finalised.

## Methods of data analysis

The  data  from  the  SRSSDL  Questionnaire  were  analysed  by  obtaining  the mean and standard deviation for each of the five SDL broad areas in the preand post-tests. Cohen's (1998) effect sizes were calculated to determine any

practical significances of PSTs' responses between the pre-test and the posttest, with the cut-off points of 0.2 for low effect, 0.5 for medium effect and 0.8 for large effect. Even though the p -values of the SRSSDL Questionnaire were tabulated,  I  did  not  report  any  statistical  significance  of  the  intervention because a random sample was not selected. The p -values were included for the  completeness  of  the  findings.  I  transcribed,  coded  and  analysed  the interview  data.  The  transcripts  were  analysed  by  looking  for  codes  that represented  characteristics  of  SDL,  and  these  codes  were  grouped  under different themes used to support the data from the SRSSDL Questionnaire. The qualitative instruments were triangulated to ensure the trustworthiness of the findings in this study. Furthermore, member checking and verbatim quotes from the participants were employed to support credibility and trustworthiness. I  did  not  aim  to  generalise  the  findings,  as  the  findings  only  reflect  the experiences of the participants in the specific context in which the study was conducted.

## Results

Here, I present findings from both the quantitative and qualitative data used to illuminate answers to the above-mentioned questions. These findings do not only reveal PSTs' experiences of computing multiple solutions to geometry problems but also reveal their SDL-related experiences before and after the intervention. I begin by analysing the quantitative data from the SRSSDL and then broaden the picture by including the qualitative data from the MSTQs and the semi-structured interviews.

## Quantitative results from the self-rating scale for self-directed learning

A dependent t-test was conducted with the student data from the pre- and post-tests. Of the 32 students enrolled for the module, only 31 completed the pre-test, and 24 completed the post-test. As I conducted a dependent t-test, the pre-test data of the students who did not complete the post-test were excluded, reducing the sample size to 24 participants. Just as confirmed in previous  findings  that  Williamson's  SRSSDL  Questionnaire  has  validity  in different contexts, the questionnaire also showed that it was valid and reliable in  the  context  of  the  current  study  with  a  Cronbach's  alpha  coefficient  of 0.834.  Statistical  findings  from  the dependent  t-test are  represented  in Table 9.1 to understand the effects of the intervention on students' SDL.

Table 9.1 reveals that the effect sizes of each SDL area range from no effect to small effects, with the overall score revealing no effect, meaning that the intervention did not have any practical significance for PSTs' SDL. However, if one compares the individual SDL areas, it is clear that the intervention did

have  a  small  practical  significance  for  PSTs' awareness and evaluation .  No practical significance can be attached to learning strategies, learning activities and interpersonal  skills after  the  intervention.  Thereafter,  PSTs'  responses were also divided according to the SRSSDL scoring categories of low (60-140), moderate (141-220) and high (221-300) to measure their level of SDL after the intervention.  Table  9.2  represents  the  distribution  of  PSTs'  scoring  in  the SRSSDL between the categories in the pre- and post-tests. The overall effect size between the categories shows that there was a movement of students between the categories.

In the low category, there was one student in the pre-test and none in the post-test;  hence,  no  statistical  analysis  was  performed  in  this  category. Moreover, because of the small number of participants in each category in the pre-  and  post-tests,  I  could  not  perform  the dependent  t-test .  Hence  to determine the effect sizes of this sample size, I used the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. table 9.3 reveals that the mean scores for students with initially moderate SDL scores increased in four SDL areas except for awareness which remained with the same mean score. Furthermore, the effect sizes of these students reveal that the intervention had practical significances that range from small to large (table 9.3).

Table 9.3 reveals that there was a large improvement in PSTs' interpersonal skills, with medium practical significances for learning strategies and learning activities , indicating a high and  medium  practical  significance  of the intervention in these SDL areas. However, in this group of PSTs, there was a

small practical significant change for awareness and evaluation. Nonetheless, the overall impression from table 9.3 is that there was an increase in SDL for PSTs  with  initially  moderate  SDL  scores  after  the  intervention.  Concerning PSTs who initially had high SDL scores, their mean scores (table 9.4) revealed a  slight  decrease  in  their  SDL  for  all  SDL  areas.  Despite  this  decrease,  the intervention still showed some practical significance in the overall score of students with an initially high SDL score.

The mean scores (table 9.4) show that PSTs' post-test scores are lower than those of the pre-test. Pre-service student teachers with initially high SDL scores achieved lower scores in the post-test, which might be an indication that these PSTs may have over-rated themselves initially, or the intervention did not foster SDL. Similar results were obtained by Mentz and Van Zyl (2018), who found that cooperative learning does not improve the SDL of students with an initially high SDL score.

## Qualitative analysis: Pre-service student teachers' self-directed learning-related experiences

The  interviews  focused  on  asking  participants  questions  that  could  reveal problem-solving skills relating to SDL. All three students who completed the MSTQs and engaged in the interviews were at initially moderate (P1 and P2) and initially high (P3) SDL levels. Upon analysing the interview transcripts, it was clear that students did possess some SDL-related skills in their problemsolving and learning. Here, I report on participants' general perceptions of engaging with MSTs, which links to the improvement of their SDL. All of the

participants' responses indicated that, even though they pursued learning in order  to  pass,  they  took the  initiative  to  learn .  This  was  characterised  by utterances  such  as  'I  always  aspire  to  learn  something  new,  …  learning something new means I would have to go beyond my limits' (P3, student teacher,  21  Oct.  2020),  and  they  indicated  that  engagement  with  MSTs motivated them to take the initiative to look for more information :

'I always aspire to learn something new and also retain the knowledge that I learnt in the past. So I have got time to make for quick revision of the thing I have done in the past and then read something after that, either read something new or practice something new.' (P3, student teacher, 21 Oct. 2020)

'It's an initiative that I have to take, I have to choose and say I need to learn then I learn, … especially if you look at the conditions that we are in today, it is now selfdirected learning, you just have to do most of the things by yourself.' (P2, student teacher, 19 Oct. 2020)

'I enjoy learning new things. So, alternatively, learning something new means I would have to go beyond my limits, I'll have to then learn new information and go looking for information.' (P3, student teacher, 21 Oct. 2020)

The above findings directly relate to SDL, as they reveal that engaging in MSTs problem-solving motivated students to take initiative for their own learning. P3 with an initially high SDL score displayed more elements of taking initiative for learning as compared to P1 and P2, with an initially moderate SDL score. Furthermore,  participants  revealed  that  engaging  MSTs  problem-solving allowed them to take the initiative to look for more information whenever they got stuck in finding solutions. They indicated that they consulted both human and material learning resources:

'I used the keywords when I searched in the searching engine. Secondly, I sometimes Google the main topic, … I try my ways maybe the textbook and find other problems that are related to the problem that I have, … I go to research now, I need to do my research may be on the Internet, find a problem that is related to that problem, … It  will  force  me to consult now, on my peers, or anybody because now I cannot do it myself, but I want to have the solutions of the problem.' (P2, student teacher, 19 Oct. 2020)

'I look for keywords that I can look up, either on YouTube or over the Internet so I could actually grasp elements that could connect me to the solving of the problem, … In that case I will actually consult either my peers, if I don't find help, then I will consult somebody who is superior, meaning somebody that is a teacher to me.' (P3, student teacher, 21 Oct. 2020)

- 'I  checked the textbook … I attempted to give it to another colleague of mine….' (P1, student teacher, 14 Oct. 2020)

Another important finding from the participants pertaining to their SDL is that the lack of material resources, such as a stable Internet connection and access to computers, may hinder their learning, according to P2:

'I  think the only thing that I can change is the financial constraints, Internet connection, gadgets, and all that needs to be improved like a stable Internet connection. You find

that you are reading a certain article and then they reference another person, you need the Internet and a laptop to search for it and try to understand it.' (P2, student teacher, 19 Oct. 2020)

Hence, even though the engagement with MSTs can motivate students to take the initiative look for more information, the lack of such resources may be a hindrance to their learning. What was also evident from their utterances was that  they  looked  for  information  for  different  reasons:  P1  mentioned  that he looks for more information in order to boast to his fellow students that he had learnt something that they did not know; P2, on the other hand, seemed to be looking for more information because he was stuck; and P3 looked for more information because he enjoyed learning:

'Indeed. It motivated me because I feel so superior on my other colleagues and friends … I feel like I have learned something, which they didn't know. So I can say I was boasting and bragging that I have learned something.' (P1, student teacher, 14 Oct. 2020)

'If I am working with a problem and … I get stuck I am forced to go out and research, if I try to research and I do not find anything, then I need to consult from my peers, maybe my lecturers or my peers have seen that problem…' (P2, student teacher, 19 Oct. 2020)

'I enjoy learning new things. So alternatively learning something new means I would have to go beyond my limits, I will have to then learn new information go looking for information, so yes, doing multiple solutions problems gave me a hustle, pushed me to go and learn a bit more.' (P3, student teacher, 21 Oct. 2020)

Even though these participants were motivated by different reasons to study further, the most noticeable SDL-related observation is that they were indeed motivated to  learn  more  instead  of  giving  up  when  they  faced  unfamiliar problems. In addition to motivation, P3 indicated resilience in his learning as he stated that:

'I hate comfort, simple put, and giving up is a sign of being comfortable with what you know and you don't want to learn something else. So I won't be the type to give up, I rather push until I reach a breaking point and I know that by the time I reach the breaking point it means I am very close to finding whatever that I need.' (P3, student teacher, 21 Oct. 2020)

Furthermore, P3 indicated that his learning was not centred on examination but to prepare himself for the unforeseeable future, while the other participants (P1 and P2) were clear that they learnt for the examination. This confirms the findings from the SRSSDL Questionnaire that P3 had a much higher perceived SDL compared to P1 and P2:

'I  will  partially listen to it but if it is not for examination purposes, no … well, we are  learning  for  examination,  we  are  learning  for  grading.'  (P1,  student  teacher, 14 Oct. 2020)

'I would rather focus on the topic that would be examinable.' (P2, student teacher, 19 Oct. 2020)

'I will make sure that I concentrate as much as I can in order to learn what I have to learn because I believe that even though it is not examinable now, chances are during my teaching years I might need to use that kind of a skill.' (P3, student teacher, 21 Oct. 2020)

However,  P3  further  indicated  a  struggle  with self-management of  his learning - he struggled to manage time for learning and other activities:

'Yes,  I  am  happy  with  the  pattern  that  I  am  using  to  study,  but  one  thing  that I need to work on is maximizing on the time, I tend to get a bit distracted and the distraction end up taking more time, so maximizing on the amount of time that I  have given myself so that I could be effective in the next session.' (P3, student teacher, 21 Oct. 2020)

I want to conclude this section by giving a synopsis of PSTs' experiences that were not related to SDL, most of which were visible in the utterances of P1 and P2, visibly with an initially moderate SDL score. These experiences represent utterances that show that in particular elements of their learning, P1 and P2 were not self-directed at all, while P3 exuded SDL all round. When asked how he approached unfamiliar problems, P1 said, 'if I don't have a hint about it, I will check the follow-up question' (P1, student teacher, 14 Oct. 2020), which were signs of 'giving up' whenever he encountered a difficult problem. In contrast, P2 seemed not to have recognised lack of knowledge as a learning opportunity; instead, whenever he solved unfamiliar problems, he preferred to start with what he knew about the problem. When asked why he did not start with what he did not know, P2 mentioned that, 'if I start with what I don't [know], I am stuck because what I don't know, I don't know' (P2, student teacher, 19 Oct. 2020). He  was  clear  that  his  theoretical  belief  about  learning  was  that  it started  with  prior  knowledge:  '…because  I  normally  have  this  belief  that learning start from what you know, from your previous experiences' (P2, student teacher, 19 Oct. 2020). There was also evidence the P2 was scared of challenges and wanted to stay in his comfort zone from his utterance: 'I will look at the concept, if it's so complex, I would avoid it, but if it is easy to complement then I  will  learn  it'  (P2,  student  teacher,  19  Oct.  2020).  Furthermore, statements such  as  'we  are  learning  for  examination,  we  are  learning  for  grading,  like marks' (P1, student teacher, 19 Oct. 2020), 'I would rather focus on the topic that would be examinable' (P2, student teacher, 19 Oct. 2020) and 'I want to get  the  final  answer,  I  want  to  solve  it,  that's  the  main  thing'  (P1,  student teacher, 14 Oct. 2020) show that P1 and P2 were still concerned about getting correct answers, examinations and their grades even after the intervention. This may mean that they might have thought that they were self-directed in their  learning,  but  when  they  encountered  problems,  they  still  reverted  to their  problem-solving  methods  that  showed  no  self-direction  in  learning. These experiences of P1 and P2 are in line with the current view that teaching and learning in schools and universities still follow the traditional approach of focusing on examinations and grades instead of learning (Aldridge, Fraser &amp; Sabela 2004; Ogbuehi &amp; Fraser 2007).

## Pre-service student teachers' experiences of computing multiple solutions to geometry problems

The selected three participants were given five MSTs to solve and were given 30 days to submit, which they all did. The solutions to these problems relied mainly  on  participants'  geometry  knowledge  and  their  problem-solving strategies. Participants either solved the problem correctly, incorrectly or did not make an attempt to solve the problem. Table 9.5 summarises the number of  solutions  obtained  from  participants'  responses  in  the  MSTQs  after  the intervention.  From  Table  9.5,  it  is  clear  that  P1  and  P2  were  not  able  to compute all the possible solutions to these MSTs, while P3 was able to find all the solutions. There was evidence of participants who were able to obtain one solution instead of two or three as the MSTQ required. This is an indication that, even though these participants (P1 and P2) were able to find solutions to these geometry problems, they were not competent enough to find alternative solutions.

P3,  with  an  initially  high  SDL,  was  able  to  find  all  the  solutions  to  the problems, while P1 and P2 with an initially moderate SDL were not able to find all the solutions (Table 9.5), which is evidence that PSTs' self-directedness in learning has an effect on their multiple solutions problem-solving. As is evident from the qualitative SDL-related experiences of the participants, P3 seemed more self-directed in his learning compared to P1 and P2, and his submission of the MSTQ solutions indicated that he was able to obtain all the multiple solutions to the MSTs. As observed from P1's responses, he attempted to solve problem 2, but admitted in his solution that there was 'no way forward' [P1, student teacher, 14 Oct. 2020] and that his solution was 'wrong' [P1, student teacher, 14 Oct. 2020] (Figure 9.1). When asked about this during the interview, P1 indicated that he could not relate the two circles even though he knew one theorem:

'I  knew how to use the information of the first circle. The circle which is having points on the circumference which is E C F D. … Then the second circle, the one that is having A E F and B, I couldn't use it to relate to the information given, that was the main problem.' (P1, student teacher, 14 Oct. 2020)

Further  questioning  revealed  that  P2  had  limited  knowledge  of  cyclic quadrilateral theorems, as his focus was on one theorem instead of the other theorems and corollaries.

The  use  of  visual  representations  also  seemed  dominant  in  P1  and  P2's responses  as  they,  in  most  cases,  attempted  to  represent  the  geometrical theorems separately or even use colour-coding to visualise the geometrical theorems individually (Figure 9.2 and Figure 9.3). This mnemonic of spatiographic thinking is one important factor of developing geometrical thinking and problem-solving (Watson, Jones &amp; Pratt 2013), but these students had not  developed  that  geometry  problem-solving  knowledge  because  even though  they  used  it,  they  could  not  find  the  multiple  solutions  to  all  the geometry problems.

What is interesting is that P1 was able to find at least one solution where he used a mnemonic, but he could not find the solutions to the problems where he did not use a mnemonic. This grounded P1's mathematical problem-solving on the usage of mnemonics and procedures; if he could not remember the mnemonic or the procedure, he could not solve the problem. This was also evident in his utterances, saying that 'I think if we can be given a method that if  you  are  having  this  type  of  question,  follow  this  method,  and  if  you  are having this type of question follow that method' (P1, student teacher, 14 Oct. 2020).

In  contrast,  P2  filled  information  on  the  diagram  and  used  colours  to differentiate between different shapes in the given diagram for visualisation as a problem-solving strategy. P2 mentioned that 'I fill the diagram with as much information as I can before I can even look at the question' (P2, student teacher,  19  Oct.  2020),  which  is  symptomatic  of  looking  for  a  certain procedure to solve the problem and an attempt to remain within his comfort zone. This shows that, even though P1 and P2 were able to find some solutions to  the  geometry  problems,  they  were  not  competent  enough  in  their problem-solving strategies to solve geometry problems. What differentiates P3 from P1 and P2 is that his approach to problem-solving, though systematic, was  supported  by  valid  reasons  of  why  certain  routes  were  taken.  He mentioned that:

'The method I normally use is to deconstruct the question, break it into smaller pieces and see if I can relate it to anything that I have learnt prior and the reason I do that is because I have noticed that breaking things down into smaller pieces helps to actually find solutions to the bigger picture because these smaller pictures have linkages on how to find the solution to the bigger picture.' (P3, student teacher, 21 Oct. 2020)

Willingness to produce multiple solutions to mathematical problems can also be related to SDL, as it depends on the goal for such action. When asked if they would produce multiple solutions to mathematical problems, the PSTs had different answers. P2 and P3 were clear that they would produce multiple solutions to mathematical problems if they were not restricted to time, like in an  examination.  P2  indicated  with  conviction that  '…  definitely.  It  shows understanding. Because, it really shows that you really understand what you are  talking  about,  you  are  representing  it  in  different  ways  and  with  valid reasons why it can be done in this way and that way' [P2, student teacher, 19  Oct.  2020]. He was,  however,  clear  that  he  would  not  produce  multiple solutions  in  the  examination  because  of  the  focus  on  marks  and  the  time limitation: 'no, you cannot do that in an examination… because the examination is about marks and time' (P2, student teacher, 19 Oct. 2020). P3 mentioned that 'in a context where I am not limited to time I would do that, to show that this problem has more than one solution' (P3, student teacher, 21 Oct. 2020). P3's non-production of multiple solutions in the examination was only hindered

by time, while P2 also drew attention to the concentration on grading. P2's focus on the marks was similar to that of P1, who was clear that he would not produce multiple solutions to mathematical problems if they were not to be marked:

'If they say extended and say we are going to mark them and select the one that you got more marks on, rather than saying we mark the first one, if you got two in the second one if you get one, we are going to select like the second one, because you've got more marks there, I will produce as many as I can.' (P1, student teacher, 14 Oct. 2020)

He lamented that his past educational experiences have discouraged him to search  for  multiple  solutions  because  his  teachers  always  marked  the  first attempt  and  ignored  the  other  attempts  instead  of  marking  the  correct attempt. He mentioned that: 'We are discouraged to do that. At a young age, I used to attempt questions differently, the teacher will say I will mark the first solution.' (P1, student teacher, 14 Oct. 2020)  On account of their experiences . of producing multiple solutions, PSTs felt that it was a good experience, even though P2 indicated that he felt like he was doing the same thing in different ways. Table 9.5 shows that P2 was able to find most solutions to the problems but  could  not  find  the  alternative  solutions  because  of  feeling  like  he  was doing the same thing differently:

'It was a good experience (to produce multiple solutions). But if you look at those other problems that have one solution, sometimes you can claim to say we have two solutions but rather you still have that same solution and you have written it in different ways. Because to have different solutions you might have rewritten it in a different way using the same theorems.' (P2, student teacher, 19 Oct. 2020)

This is an indication of various things: (1) P2 still lacked problem-solving strategies for geometry and the 'control' to choose useful actions that could help in finding the solutions, (2) P2 might still have lacked understanding of multiple solutions, and (3) he was not self-directed enough to take the initiative to learn more about what multiple solutions meant and only read what was provided during the module. P3 also mentioned that finding multiple solutions to geometry problems was a good experience, as it motivated him to learn more about geometry knowledge that was helpful for him finding the solutions to the given problems. He mentioned that:

'It was  a  thrilling  experience,  because  it  pushed  me  to  get  a  much  greater understanding of corollary theorems, I had to understand those because I was not that big on them, so it pushed me to learn more about them and how to use them, and also it became an eye opener on a lot of things that I had actually forgotten, so it pushed me to learn more or re-learn some of the things that I have actually done.' (P3, student teacher, 21 Oct. 2020)

Furthermore, P3 mentioned that, besides exploring the different ways in which the problem could be solved, he would show learners multiple solutions to provide them with different ways of solving mathematical problems:

'To basically explore different ways in which the problem can be solved and I would do it to show the learners that they should not be restricted to one way or one method of finding the solution.' (P3, student teacher, 21 Oct. 2020)

The production of multiple solutions to mathematical problems is also believed to open up opportunities to solve the problems in an easier way, as explained earlier by P2. P3 also reiterated:

'The more I do something, the more it opens up easier ways of doing it. For example, if I can get a trigonometry sum that required me to prove something and I didn't know compound angles I would go the longer route but if I knew compound angles I  would  just  employ  a  new  concept  of  compound  angles  to  that  to  help  me  to shorten the steps of the solution, and not only will I have two solutions because of that now, I would have the first one that would be the long route, I would have the second one that uses compound angles. So it gives me two things, which means that I have learnt something new and I have managed to find a new way of doing it.' (P3, student teacher, 21 Oct. 2020)

From the findings in the MSTQs task sheets and the interviews, it is clear that P3  found  more  solutions  compared  to  P1  and  P2,  which  implies  that  his geometry problem-solving competency was much more advanced compared to the other participants. Furthermore, this analysis shows that P3 was more self-directed  in  his  learning  compared  to  P1  and  P2,  which  concurs  with the earlier findings from the quantitative measurement of SDL. Hence, it can be concluded that the more self-directed PSTs are, the more competent they are in their problem-solving.

## Discussion

This section addresses the research questions posed earlier in this chapter. It provides  relative  answers  to  the  questions  based  on  findings  from  the participants. The questions addressed in the section are:

- · How does solving MSTs in a remote learning environment display teacher competency in geometry problem-solving?
- · What  are  the  self-directed  benefits  of  computing  multiple  solutions  to geometry  problems  in  a  remote  learning  environment  for  pre-service mathematics teachers?

These questions are addressed based on the findings from the quantitative and qualitative investigations conducted in this study.

## Self-directed learning-related experiences of engaging with multiple-solution tasks

The findings from Williamson's SRSSDL Questionnaire show that there was a large amount of student movement between different SDL ranges from initially moderate to high perceived SDL and vice versa (Table 9.2). Overall, the intervention did not improve students' SDL but did have a small practical

significance  in  their  awareness  and  evaluation  SDL  areas  (Table  9.1).  This means  that,  after  the  intervention,  students  became  more  aware  of  the factors that contributed to their SDL and were more aware of strategies to use in order to monitor their learning (Williamson 2007). Table 9.3 shows that  the  intervention  did  have  small  to  large  practical  significance  for students with an initially moderate SDL score, while Table 9.4 shows that the intervention  did  not  have  much  significance  for  students  with  an  initially high  SDL  score,  but  it  did  have  some  practical  significance  in  some  SDL areas,  which  still  resulted  in  lower  SDL  in  the  post-test.  This  is  not  only evident in the effect sizes of the SDL areas between the two group ranges but also in the increase in the mean scores of the initially moderate group (Table 9.3) and the decrease in the mean scores of the initially high group (Table  9.4).  Unlike  the  results  from  Rezaee  and  Mosalanejad  (2015),  the results obtained from this study are similar to those obtained by Havenga (2016) and Mentz and Van Zyl (2018) which show that interventions improved the SDL scores of students with an initially moderate SDL score and did not have an effect on the SDL of students with an initially high SDL score. This can be attributed to the fact that students who already have a high SDL score would take the initiative to ensure that they get all the solutions to mathematical problems and learn more, as seen in the case of P3, who in his interview  responses  was  evidently  more  self-directed  than  the  other  two participants.  Hence,  the  intervention  compelling  students  with  high  SDL (P3)  to  produce  multiple  solutions  does  not  influence  them  to  produce multiple  solutions,  because  they  are  always  ready  to  take  any  learning challenge that requires them to learn more about mathematical problemsolving. It can be concluded then that the introduction of MSTs does not affect the SDL of students with high SDL scores but does affect students with moderate SDL scores. In fact, problem-solving and SDL are indispensable and are continually supporting each other (Lin et al. 2019).

The SDL-related benefits of engaging in intervention, as evident from PSTs' participation in the interviews, can be summarised as follows:

- · Students took the initiative for their learning by looking for more information to help them find multiple solutions.
- · They became more motivated to learn more because they wanted to find multiple solutions.
- · They  took  the  initiative  to  locate  both  human  and  material  learning resources whenever they were stuck in a particular problem.
- · P3 indicated that, even though it was not a requirement in CAPS to produce multiple solutions, he did teach his learners (during WIL) multiple solutions to give them different options for solving mathematical problems.
- · The engagement in the intervention also revealed that the student measuring high on SDL showed resilience and grit in his learning by ensuring that he kept on trying until he found all the different solutions to geometry problems.

A recent study positioning SDL as a 21st-century skill claimed that teaching and learning  should  focus  on  developing  students'  SDL  so  they  can  move away from eyeing the product to valuing the learning process (Du Toit-Brits &amp; Blignaut 2019). This means that students like P1 who focused on finding the solution to a problem instead of learning should be guided to value individual learning like P3.

## Teacher competency in solving geometry problems

Schoenfeld (1994) argued that students should work on problems that would introduce  them  to  mathematical  thinking.  He  (Schoenfeld  1994)  described four properties of the problems that can serve this purpose, one of which is quoted below:

For  many  reasons,  I  tend  to  prefer  problems  that  can  be  solved,  or  at  least approached, in a number of ways. It's good for students to see multiple solutions, since they tend to think, on the basis of prior knowledge, that there is only one way to solve any given problem (which is usually the method the teacher has just demonstrated in class). I need for them to understand that the 'bottom line' is not just getting the answer but seeing the connections. Moreover, on the process level, the  possibility  of  multiple  approaches  lays  open  issues  of  executive  decisions  what directions or approaches should we pursue when solving problems, and why? (p. 69)

Here, Schoenfeld characterised MSTs as the foundation of developing students' mathematical thinking. Most of these characteristics were visible in the data from this study. With reference to Table 9.5, it can be concluded that P3 had a high geometry problem-solving competency after the intervention compared to P1 and P2. This is evident in the fact that P3 was able to find all the multiple solutions required in the MSTQs. It can be concluded then that the intervention does  affect  the  geometry  problem-solving  competency  of  some  students, especially those with an initially high perceived SDL. The findings from the MSTQs and the interviews further aligned with the findings from Sim and Oh (2012),  who  found  that  SDL-related  qualities  have  the  ability  to  improve mathematical  problem-solving.  Even  though  students  who  had  an  initially moderate  SDL  score  increased  their  SDL  more  than  the  students  with  an initially high SDL score, they still could not find all the multiple solutions to the problems in the MSTQs. Despite these findings, Guberman and Leikin (2013) revealed that the employment of MSTs could improve problem-solving ability in both low- and high-achieving students. The high SDL level and problemsolving competency of P3 influenced his teaching choices during WIL, as he indicated  that  he  was  able  to  integrate  multiple  solutions  when  teaching fractions  to  his  Grade  8  learners.  This  finding  implies  that  teachers'  high perceived SDL level in conjunction with high competency in problem-solving can  influence  teachers  to  guide  learners  in  finding  multiple  solutions  to mathematical problems.

Some level of low problem-solving competency in students with initially moderate SDL scores was evident in P1 admitting that he was 'stuck' and there was no way forward in his solution (figure 9.1). Visualisation skills have long  been  deemed critical  in  solving  mathematical  problems  (Bansilala  &amp; Naidoo 2012; Bishop 1989), and this significance was seen in this study when P1 admitted that he could not relate the two circles in problem 2. Furthermore, to signify the role of visualisation during problem-solving, P2 used colouring (figure 9.3) to visualise theorems during problem-solving. Tutak and Adams (2017) have shown that the lack of geometry CK in pre-service mathematics teachers can hinder their abilities to solve geometry problems, as seen on the part of P1. Furthermore, what was evident from P1 and P2 was the use of mnemonics to remember theorems (Figure 9.2 and Figure 9.3). Even though these participants were able to identify the theorems, either by using colourcoding, filling information in the diagram or drawing a visual that represented the theorems, they could still not find all the solutions required in the MSTQs. These  PSTs  still  approached  mathematical  problem-solving  through  the procedural approach. P1 even mentioned: 'I think, uh, it is the procedure that, eh, Euclidean geometry was introduced to us. That's the problem, eh, they only taught us to solve using procedure and less application' (P1, student teacher,  14  Oct.  2020).  This  shows  that,  even  after  the  intervention,  his procedural approach to mathematical problem-solving was still the preferable method for problem-solving, and whenever procedures failed, he was always stuck (figure 9.1). Participants knew the benefits of producing multiple solutions, for example, they stated that producing multiple solutions showed that one had a deep understanding of the content, problem-solving strategies and also gave learners options of methods to use when solving mathematical problems. In this regard, Silver (1997) asserted that, through the  use  of  MSTs,  teachers  can  enable  learners  to  discover  their  potential creativity and enhance learners' mathematical problem-solving. In conceptualising  a  theoretical  framework  for  assessing  problem-solving, Schoenfeld (1985) observed that the beliefs one holds about the nature of mathematics  can  affect  one's  problem-solving.  Relating  this  theoretical framework to the current study, it is clear that P2's inability to find multiple solutions to most of the problems was triggered by his beliefs about problemsolving and mathematical learning.

Hence, engaging in the intervention revealed students' geometry problemsolving competency through their abilities to provide multiple solutions to the posed problems. Participants who could solve the problems, for example, find at least one solution to the problem, show that they had a complete understanding of geometry and could solve geometry problems; however, their competency was low compared to students who could find multiple solutions to geometry problems. The mathematical challenge provided by the  requirement  of  multiple  solutions  in  the  teaching  and  learning  of

mathematics is critical for the learning process (Guberman &amp; Leikin 2013), and being able to solve mathematical tasks in different ways is a sign of achieving  competency  in  problem-solving  (Polya  1973).  Furthermore,  the production  of  multiple  solutions  to  mathematical  problems  represents  a competency in divergent thinking that allows students to communicate their original mathematical ideas and problem-solving strategies during problemsolving. Hence,  engaging  in  the  production  of  multiple solutions to mathematical problems does not only reveal competency in problem-solving but also reveal resilience in learning. Multiple-solution tasks have also been shown that they can be useful in improving the development of mathematics teachers'  knowledge  and  also  their  knowledge  for  teaching  and  learning (Leikin  &amp;  Levav-Waynberg  2008)  and  in  geometry  specifically  (Leikin  &amp; Levav-Waynberg 2012).

## Limitations and recommendations

One of the limitations of the current study is the duration of the intervention. It was very unfortunate that the intervention could not be extended beyond the 12-week period because of the limitations on the duration of the course in which the intervention was implemented. A longer engagement with MSTs might have influenced PSTs' problem-solving, as Schoenfeld (1994) described that problem-solving enriches the longer one engages in it. Furthermore, a larger  sample  from  a  variety  of  contexts  might  have  enriched  the  data obtained and provided a better understanding of PSTs' SDL. As I purposely sampled participants for the interviews, I could not capture all the problemsolving  experiences  of  the  PSTs.  The  findings  of  this  study  are  thus  not generalisable to the larger population. This means that further research in different contexts is required to ensure the generalisability and transferability of the findings.

There  is  a  need  for  further  research  to  understand  the  specific  SDL characteristics of students with high SDL that allowed them (P3) to obtain multiple solutions in all the problems in the MSTQs. Furthermore, the lack of empirical research on the usefulness of MSTs in the teaching and learning of mathematics in both basic education and HE in South Africa is of concern. The numerous  benefits  of  MSTs  highlighted  by  research  in  different  countries mean that this  practice  is  useful  in  mathematics  education  and  should  be engaged  with  in  South  African  education.  I  recommend  that  a  study  be conducted with a much larger population from different contexts where more students would be involved in the completion of MSTQs and participate in interviews to provide a broader understanding of the relationship between engaging  in  MSTs  and  mathematical  problem-solving.  It  is  clear  from  the findings  that  engaging  in  the  intervention  had  some  factors  that  affected students' SDL, but given the small scale of this study, it was difficult to pinpoint

these factors and reach a generalisable stance of the findings. Nonetheless, the increase in students' SDL could not be attributed to the intervention only, as  it  was  clear  in  the  case  of  P1,  P2  and  P3  that  some  personal  attributes contributed  to  their production  of  multiple  solutions  to mathematical problems.

## Conclusion

In this chapter, I explored the effects of engaging in the production of multiple solutions to Euclidean geometry problems on students' SDL. Furthermore, I  explored  how  engagement in  this  intervention  revealed  students'  competency in solving geometry problems. The findings show that the intervention did not have a practical significance for students' SDL but it was able to increase the SDL of students with an initially moderate SDL score. This increase in the SDL scores of the students with initially moderate SDL scores after engaging in  the  intervention  can  be  of  educational  importance  in  the  teaching  and learning  of  mathematics.  This  means  that,  after  the  intervention,  students with an initially moderate perceived SDL were a little aware of the factors contributing to their development of SDL qualities and they were in a position to  monitor  their  learning  activities  (Williamson  2007).  However,  students with an initially high perceived SDL score achieved lower scores in the posttest, which might be an indication that they over-rated themselves in the pretest, but after the intervention, it became clear that their initial scores were not reflecting their true level of SDL. This means one of two things: first, the students thought they were self-directed prior the intervention, but when confronted  with  the  intervention  that  required  more  self-direction,  they realised that they were not quite as self-directed as they thought they were before the intervention; second, the activity of producing multiple solutions to mathematical problems may have not appealed to these students' SDL as expected. Findings from the interviews indicated that some characteristics of SDL  were  influenced  by  the  intervention  and  also  individual  personal attributes. The findings from the MSTQs task sheets indicated that students with an initially high perceived SDL were more competent in finding multiple solutions  (P3)  to  geometry  problems  compared  to  those  with  an  initially moderate perceived SDL (P1 and P2). Furthermore, P3 was clear about his motivation to learn instead of obtaining good results (P1 and P2). He succinctly explained his problem of time management when he started to look for more information and resources as he dug deeper into his learning. It is clear that P3 had much love for learning, and his inquisitiveness was clear compared to P1 and P2, who were concerned only with their grades. In this study, P3 was a typical SDL learner because he took full responsibility for his learning, while P1 and P2 only followed the instructions from the facilitator to obtain good marks without seeing the real benefits of searching for multiple solutions.

Even though they engaged in the intervention, P1 and P2 still focused on assessment  and  marks.  The  overall  findings  indicate  that  MSTs  can  be  a strategy that can be used to advance the SDL of students with an initially moderate SDL and also reveal students' competency in geometry problems for those with an initially high perceived SDL.

## Abstract

complex phenomena not so far explored in the literature. In particular, studies of the effects of unschooling on cognitive development have resulted in the idea that school  concepts  and  everyday  concepts  developed  through unschooled self-directed  strategies  may  not  be  the  same.  With  respect  to street and school mathematics, research has identified important differences in  the  type  of  representation used; street mathematics is self-directed and oral and preserves much of the meaning of the situation at hand, whereas mathematical practice in school is written and drill-oriented and strives for generality. This chapter examines whether the acquisition of numeracy using self-directed approaches and engagement in specific numeracy practices in workplace settings differentially modifies the type of representation in groups of street vendors and illiterate adults living in non-symbolic cultural contexts. The ethnosemantic analysis of vending practices presented focuses on the structure of logical relationships and the underlying complex computations inherent  in  a  folk  system  of  arithmetic  that  have  been  developed  and appropriated by semi-illiterate street vendors in a self-directed manner.

## Introduction

Global concerns about student achievement in schools have been overwhelmingly daunting. With the devastating effect of COVID-19 pandemic on multiple sectors of the world's wealth early in 2020, urgent measures to respond  both  to  the  immediate  health  crisis  and  to  the  severe  economic, social and financial challenges had to be put in place to absorb and mitigate the massive human and economic devastation across the world. Education in particular succumbed to monumental struggles that demanded every resource and every effort to intensify its  interventions.  Part  of  several  multi-faceted responses  to  address  educational  shortcomings  because  of  the  COVID-19 pandemic has been to resort to remote teaching and learning, which in turn compounded  the  problem  as  students  as  well  as  teachers  struggled  to navigate  the  online  space.  Specifically,  in  mathematics,  unprecedented challenges in online delivery of instruction have emerged rendering success in acquiring  basic  competences  almost  impossible  (Aldon  et  al.  2021;  Carius 2020). As such, the focus of mathematics learning shifted towards capacitating learners with the necessary critical and reflective skills to be autonomous and assume ownership of their learning. This view of learning closely mimics the apprenticeship  model  of  instruction  that  is  embedded  in  engaged  and networked  communities  of  practice  most  commonly  prevalent  outside  of formal school settings.

A  good  deal  of  studies  investigated  the  multiplicity  of  ways  in  which mathematical concepts are acquired outside of school contexts by virtually appealing to research on the social construction of mathematical knowledge

and  problem-solving  activity (Aguirre, Mayfield-Ingram  &amp; Martin 2013; Brandt &amp; Chernoff 2014; Chahine &amp; De Beer 2020; Chahine &amp; Kinuthia 2019; Naresh &amp; Chahine 2013). More concisely, I refer to the works of two groups of researchers, those interested in 'cognition in practice' or 'every day cognition' and those involved in ethnomathematics in an attempt to provide evidence that mathematical knowledge is situated, embodied and highly contextualised (Chahine 2013). Such research describes mathematical ideas that emerge in out of school mathematics as self-directed and created through negotiation of  meaning  in  different  cultures  and  communities  to  address  everyday  life challenges.  At  the  heart  of  the  evidence  provided  by  this  research  is  the role  of  schooling  and  the  possibility  of  transfer  of  formal  mathematics  to out-of-school situations.

A renewed interest in research related to the significance of multicultural mathematics has been revitalised by considerable theoretical and methodological  advancements  in  SDL  approaches  characteristic  of  nonformal settings or what is also known as autodidaxy (Popovic 2012). Caffarella (1993)  recognised  SDL  as  a  self-initiated  process  where  the  learner  is autonomous in managing their own activity.  Such  a  perspective  places  an increased emphasis on a strong sense of responsibility, an intrinsic need for self-actualisation and immediate problem-solving skills, traits that are typical of workplace environments. For example, in studying the arithmetic of Liberian tailors,  Reed  and  Lave  (1981)  found  two  inherently  different  modalities  of doing  mathematics.  Tailors  with  no  schooling  experience  employed  a quantitative  approach  that  emphasises  a  contextualised  restructuring  of quantities, which is conducted orally. Contrastingly, the schooled tailors used symbol-based computations that are more abstract and devoid of any context. Such  different  modes  of  doing  arithmetic  may  be  employed  by  the  same individuals,  especially  if  they  use  mathematics  in  everyday  work  settings (Nunes et al. 1993). Arguably, investigating the informal arithmetic procedures acquired through self-directed problem-solving in out of school settings, that is, the computational strategies that people use in solving word problems that require  additive  and  multiplicative  principles  constitute  the  impetus  for exploring empirical evidence for the manifestation of everyday cognition in real-life settings. Matang and Owen (2014) argued that arithmetic is a very simple  aspect  of  mathematics.  Furthermore,  quantitative  reasoning,  while closely  linked  to  real-life  experiences,  it  is  also  part  of  mathematics  as  an abstract and formal body of knowledge (Schulz 2018). In contrast, Lave and Wenger (1990:6) contended that one of the several reasons for focusing on arithmetic was that 'arithmetic activity has formal properties, which makes it identifiable  in  the  flow  of  experience  in  many  different  situations'  and Lave  (1988:5)  explained  that  'it  (arithmetic)  has  a  highly  structured  and

incorrigible lexicon, easily recognizable in the course of ongoing activity' (cf. Brown, Collins &amp; Duguid 1989:35).

## Problem statement

The overarching aim of this chapter is to examine whether the acquisition of numeracy  using  self-directed  approaches  and  the  engagement  in  specific numeracy practices in workplace settings differentially modify each type of representation in groups of young street vendors and illiterate adults living in non-symbolic  cultural  contexts.  The  ethnosemantic  analysis  of  vending practices I present focuses on the structure of logical relationships and the underlying complex computations inherent in a folk system of arithmetic that have been developed and appropriated by semi-illiterate street vendors in a self-directed manner.

## Literature review

A  good  deal  of  studies  investigated  the  multiplicity  of  ways  in  which mathematical knowledge is acquired outside of school settings (cf. inter al. Ndlovu  &amp;  Nyoni  2010:110).  In  studying  the  numerical  computations  of Liberian  tailors,  Reed  and  Lave  (1981)  proposed  that  there  were  two qualitatively different modes of doing arithmetic. One approach focuses on a contextualised use of numbers as non-symbolic semantic representations emblematic of quantities, which we encounter in real-life settings while the other  perceives  of  numbers  as  symbolic  syntactic  modalities  that  are generalised across functionalities and settings, a perspective most commonly prevalent in schools (Zebian &amp; Ansari 2012). Nunes et al. (1991) argued that schooled practitioners who employ mathematical ideas in the workplace, especially in low-tech jobs, often resort to using a combination of symbolic and non-symbolic representations in computational arithmetic. If so, it may be useful then to describe and compare the uses of mathematics by  the  same  group  in  the  context-based  (informal)  and  school-based (formal) settings.

Empirical evidence comparing informal and formal procedures in arithmetic have indicated that there are often multiple systems of arithmetic in the same culture,  one  related  to  the  school  culture  and  one  that  flourishes  outside school. Saxe (1991), for example, identified two types of arithmetic practices among the Oksapmin in Papua New Guinea. One of these is based on the indigenous numeration system that uses body-part names as number labels. Both  unschooled  adults,  particularly  those  involved  in  trading,  and  school children were observed to use the body-part system in arithmetic problemsolving despite the fact that school children received formal instruction on how to solve arithmetic problems using Western algorithms from teachers

who did not know the Oksapmin language and numeration system. Similar observations  were  obtained  by  Ginsburg  (1988)  who  studied  arithmetic problem-solving among two groups in the Ivory Coast: one group, the Dioula, was  involved  in  commercial  activities;  the  other,  the  Baoule,  worked  in agriculture. Ginsburg expected these groups to have different needs and thus different levels of practice for arithmetic problem-solving. He observed that the  unschooled  children  in  the  merchant  group  displayed  more  efficient arithmetic procedures than their agriculturist counter parts. With schooling, both groups tended to adopt written arithmetic procedures.

Arguably, the distinction between informal and formal computations in the context of arithmetic operations is necessary for several reasons. D'Ambrosio (2002) contended that arithmetic is an inherently basic branch of mathematics. Also, quantitative reasoning underlies and governs everyday practices (Nunes et al. 1993). In contrast, Lave et al. (1984, cited in Millroy 1992:6) stated that one  of  the  several  reasons  for  focusing  on  arithmetic  was  that  'arithmetic activity  has  formal  properties,  which  make  it  identifiable  in  the  flow  of experience  in  many  different  situations',  and  Lave  (1988:5)  stated  that  'it (arithmetic) has a highly structured and incorrigible lexicon, easily recognizable in the course of ongoing activity'.

Further studies comparing informal and formal procedures in arithmetic have indicated that there are often multiple systems of arithmetic in the same culture,  one  related  to  the  school  culture  and  one  that  flourishes  outside school. Naresh and Chahine (2013) explored the computational strategies of bus conductors in Chennai, India, to develop a better understanding of the mathematics used in the workplace. In particular, the authors highlight the conductors'  perception  of  their  goals  as  they  engage  in  self-directed experiences during their daily practice and the mental strategies they develop in the process. They further argued that the workplace setting demanded that the conductors  perform  mental  mathematical  calculations  quickly  and efficiently.  In  the  absence  of  technological  devices,  the  bus  conductors resorted to mechanisms and heuristics to assist them in carefully avoiding errors in calculations. Naresh and Chahine asserted that the conductors, while immersed  in  their  work  activity,  have  established  and  achieved  goals  that involved  significant mental  mathematical  functionalities  not  necessarily taught in schools but were rather motivated by the situational aspects that invoke the need to develop this mental modus operandi.

The impact of context on the problem-solving behaviour in out-of-school settings  has  motivated  a  number  of  explanations  for  the  discrepancies between  informal  and  formal  learning,  particular  in  a  workplace  setting (Jurdak &amp; Shahin 2002). Two main positions can be invoked to explain the major differences between the two types of problem-solving behaviours that emerged as a result of situated reasoning. One theory focuses on the social

interaction element of the context (Whimster 2018) and the other explores the  social-cognitive  career  aspects  (Bullock-Yowell  et  al.  2020).  The  first position maintains that the situation in which mathematical calculations are performed determines the role participants have with respect to each other's and  thus  influences  people's  success.  They  also  propose  that  the  social relationship established between vendor and customer is such that vendors feel more confident of their ability and perform better.

A  social-cognitive  interpretation  would  go  along  lines  suggested  by Vygotsky (1962), which emphasise the impact of the symbolic systems used in  the  two  different  situations  rather  than  at  the  interaction  between  the people. Because the types of symbolic systems used in both situations are different, one being oral and the other written, children structure their activities in different ways. In order to sort out these possibilities, Nunes et al. (1993) conducted a replication of the study by Carraher et al. (1985) in which the relationship between the experimenter and the child remained constant, but problem-solving,  which  is  supported  by  oral  versus  written  practices  of arithmetic, was observed. The vendors were 16 3rd-graders ranging in age from 8 to 13 years, randomly selected from two state-supported schools in Recife, Brazil. Children were interviewed individually and were asked to solve arithmetic problems in three conditions: (1) in a simulated store condition, the child being the store-keeper and the experimenter the customer, (2) embedded in word problems, and (3) as computation exercises. Results of the analysis showed that, in general, the vendors were far more successful in using oral arithmetic  practices,  which  were  elicited  in  a  simulated  shop,  than  written mathematics used for computational classroom-type exercises. Oral computation procedures involved the use of two reliably identifiable routines, decomposition  and  repeated  grouping,  that  revealed  the  children's  solid understanding of the decimal system.

The comparison of oral and written arithmetic practices indicates a need to search for ways of analysing cognitive performance not so far explored in the literature. Piaget's theory has provided a framework for looking at important 'conceptual invariants', like conservation, seriation, proportionality and so on, but it does not consider differences in performance in the cognitive tasks that are supported by the same invariants (Nunes et al. 1993). However, in the last two  decades,  researchers  began  to  look  into  ways  in  which  concepts  are formed.  In  particular,  studies  of  the  effects  of  schooling  on  cognitive development have resulted in the idea that school concepts and everyday concepts may not be the same (Wellings 2003). With respect to street and school  mathematics,  Carraher  and  Schleimann  (2002)  identified  important differences in the type of representation used. Street mathematics being oral, self-directed  in  the  sense  that  it  emerges  from  practitioners'  self-chosen representations and tools that preserve much of the meaning of the situations at hand, whereas mathematical practice in school is written and avoids the

specificity  of  situation  in  striving  for  generality.  Gray  (2017)  confirmed  the self-directedness  of  indigenous  hunter-gathering  cultures,  who  thrive  in secluded regions and under harsh weather conditions use their self-regulated subsistence skills they acquired independently while in the field. He argued that  hunter-gatherers  develop  their  social  learning  behaviour  through  selfdirected exploration and play. In a similar vein, Hewlett et al. (2011) explained:

Foragers value autonomy and egalitarianism, so parents, older children, or other adults are not likely to think and feel that they know what is best or better for the child  and  are  generally  unlikely  to  initiate,  direct,  or  intervene  in  a  child's  social learning.  This  is  consistent  with  our  finding  that  forager  social  learning  is  selfmotivated and directed, but it also suggests that teaching and explicit instruction should be rare or absent. (p. 1173)

## Solving arithmetic problems embedded in situations

Several  studies  have  made  it  clear  that  children  use  a  variety  of  different conceptual structures that result in different solution procedures for the same arithmetic problem (Scheibling-Sève, Pasquinelli &amp; Sander 2020). This finding emphasised the need to consider how children think about certain problems. As a matter of fact, children's understanding of whole number addition and subtraction has been the focus of a great deal of research in the past 15 years and researchers have come a long way in understanding the variety of ways children think about single-digit addition and subtraction problems (Kullberg, Björklund &amp; Brkovic 2020). The most important problems are those developing in the real world. Fuson (1992:244) argued that there are four basic addition and subtraction situations: 'compare', 'combine', 'change add to' and 'change take  from'.  She  holds  that  the compare and combine situations  are  binary operations,  whereas  the  change Add To and  change Take  From are  unary operations where there is only one quantity to add to or take from. She also emphasised  the  fact  that  each  addition  and  subtraction  situation  involves three quantities anyone of which can be unknown and the fact that addition is an operation that makes a sum out of two known addends, while subtraction is an operation that makes an addend out of known sum and another known addend. Hence, two out of the four major situations are addition situations (change add to, and combine), while the other two (compare/equalise and change Take from) are subtraction situations.

However, the most important idea in the aforementioned situations is the distinction between the problem situation and the solution procedure (Yeo 2007). Despite of the fact that addition and subtraction situations of whole numbers  aim  primarily  at  enhancing  a  better  understanding  of  real-world situations, most of research use word problems that are 'restricted versions of real  world  problems  in  order  to  make  it  more  concrete  and  less  abstract'

(Fuson 1992:247). Researchers and teachers assume that because contexts are  used,  the  content  learned  could  transfer  to  real  world  (Ferlazzo  2017). Only  lately,  research  began  dealing  with  the  difficulties  of  out-of-school situations  where  many  variables  are  involved  and  are  acting  in  a  way  that complicates the problem solution.

## Approaches to self-directed problem-solving

Different  approaches  to  self-directed  problem-solving  have  provided different perspectives on the culturally creative ethnosemantic structure of street vending arithmetic. In many societies, mastering arithmetic skills is an  important  objective  in  the  early  years  of  schooling.  The  processes underlying acquisition of these skills have been described in a manner of information processing theories (Lawless 2019). In Lawless' (2019) description of the steps involved in solving a simple addition problem, a child or adult begins by encoding the problem and then attempts to retrieve an answer directly from a knowledge base consisting of stored facts. These facts  are  represented  mentally  in  terms  of  associations,  that  vary  in strength, between the problem stated (e.g. 2 + 5 =?) and possible answers (6, 7, etc.). If the strength between the retrieved answer and the problem (Act [An]) exceeds a certain confidence criterion (c), then the answer is stated.  Otherwise,  another  retrieval  is  attempted.  This  cycle  is  repeated until an answer is retrieved with strength exceeding the confidence (c) or if  the  number  of  retrievals  exceeds  a  certain  limit  (max.).  At  this  point, retrieval stops and an answer is generated using a backup procedure, for example, counting mentally.

Kail  (1994)  argued  that  the  general  process  does  not  change  with  age. However, a problem becomes more tied to the right answer through repeated exposure. Hence, in the case of street vendors, the environment as well as the frequency with which they experienced certain types of problems might have influenced the development of their self-directed arithmetic skills. Seemingly, street vending provided a supportive learning environment for self-directed problem-solving that allowed young vendors to acquire on-the-job arithmetic skills. Ginsburg (1988) asserted that by around age 5 or 6 years, almost every child can enrich his or her knowledge and techniques by learning the type of arithmetic taught in school. However, unlike their own, the arithmetic learned through  formal  schooling  is  written  and  codified  with  explicit  rules  and procedures, which are universal and seemingly far superior than their own informal arithmetic.

From a psychological perspective, Vergnaud (1989) examined the set of situations that involve addition or subtraction of two numbers or what he calls 'additive  structures'.  In  his  work,  Vergnaud  challenged  the  traditional  view adopted by most teachers, which considers addition as a binary operation of

two parts and subtraction as finding a missing part knowing a whole and the other part. He (Vergnaud 1988) added:

[ B ]eside the binary combination of two parts into a whole, there is also the unary operation of a transformation of the initial state. There are essentially six different tasks  related  to  the  intermediate  state-transformation-final  state  relationship, among which two are solved by adding and four by subtracting. (p. 34)

Furthermore, Vergnaud (1988) specified several important concepts that are involved in addition situations, like cardinality, transformations, inversion and directed  numbers,  in  addition  to  intuitive  conceptions  that  are  implicit  in students' problem-solving strategies.

Despite all the effort expended  in teaching algorithms for solving computational problems, extensive research has indicated that some children do  not  use  them  but,  instead,  they  resort  to  using  methods  of  their  own invention,  a  form  of  mental  arithmetic  to  solve  problems  (Ross,  ValléeTourangeau &amp; Van Herwegen 2020). It has been also noted that children prefer to  use  these  invented  methods  because  they  are  more  comfortable  and meaningful than the algorithms they have learned in school (Ginsburg 1988). Extensive  research  on  children's  problem-solving  strategies  indicated  that children  invent  methods  in  an  attempt  to  solve  the  more  difficult,  verbal operation problems (Fischbein et al. 1985). Moreover, it has been found that children's choice of operations needed to solve a verbal problem depends, to a large extent, on the specific numerical data that are given in a problem (Daroczy et al. 2015). In one study, Hart (1981) established that pupils, from 12 to 15 years old, avoided to multiply by fractions and preferred rather more complicated, indirect strategies. For example, when faced with the problem 'A 15-cm eel has 9 cm of food; how much food should be given to a 25-cm eel?', none multiplied 9 by 5/3. Instead, they used the following strategy: '10 is two thirds of 15, two thirds of 9 is 6, and 25 is 15 + 10. Therefore, one has to add 9 + 6 = 15' (p. 91).

As a result of its frequent use, these invented methods become more and more implanted in children's repertoire of problem-solving strategies and with increased  experience,  these  may  develop  into  more  complex  techniques, which  incorporate  interesting  mathematical  principles.  In  fact,  this  view  is implicative of Piaget's theory, which confirms that every mental operation is 'developmentally' rooted in practical situations. Using this argument, ample research  has  stressed  the  finding  that  each  arithmetic  operation  becomes attached to an implicit, intuitive model with its own constraints and which sometimes dictates the choice of this operation (Fischbein et al. 1985; Ginsburg 1988; Nunes et al. 1993).

Several  research  studies  have  hypothesised  that  such  implicit  models facilitate, to a certain extent, the problem-solving behaviour of children but at other times it tends to slow down the solution process (Zander, Öllinger &amp; Volz 2016). Such studies have attributed the drawbacks of these models to

constraints that these models impose on the numbers used in a problem. More importantly, research findings have clearly established that, when attempting to explicitly represent what happens when using the intuitive model in solving arithmetic  operation  problems,  many  formally  incorrect  and  meaningless algebraic procedures emerge (Kieran 1981). This finding obviously supports the  belief  that  many  of  the  obstacles  children  experience  when  solving computational exercises and word problems are inherently associated with the conflict they face between the formal, written, algorithmic arithmetic and the  related  intuitive,  mental  models.  Admittedly,  the  major  cause  of  this dilemma  is basically the difficulty children encounter  when  originally introduced to written arithmetic symbolisation, which persists into elementary level and even higher. More and more studies confirmed the fact that given a choice, children seldom use written techniques to solve practical arithmetic problems (Van Lieshout &amp; Xenidou-Dervou 2020). The most evident reason is that  intuitive  arithmetic  develops  in  a  natural  way  in  the  child's  daily environment  and  that  is  why  it  is  employed  when  dealing  with  practical problems. In this  respect,  Ginsburg  (1988)  has  cited  two  basic  reasons  for children's  difficulty  in  using  written  arithmetic.  One  is  that  children  face difficulty in understanding the one-to-one correspondence between written symbols and the objects they represent. The second is that 'mathematical events' are by their very nature difficult to represent in writing. However, when asked  to  formally  represent  their  intuitive arithmetic, children  provide idiosyncratic  algorithms  that  are  basically  a  combination  of  their  intuitive understanding with rules already learned in school.

Thompson (2007) established that young children learn about numerals and letters some time before they start school, but they hardly encounter written numbers  as  cardinal  numerals  in  real-life  situations.  Such  an  insight  could explain,  to  a  certain  extent,  the  young  vendors'  difficulty  in  using  written symbols. Similar to Hughes' (1986) characterisation of children's self-created representations  of  numerals,  the  vendors'  written  representations  can  be classified into four categories: idiosyncratic, pictographic, iconic and symbolic. Therefore, I argue that the algorithms invented by young street vendors are often based on their understanding of the situation rather than on memorisation of procedures. Furthermore, I contend that perhaps if children were afforded opportunities to be self-directed learners in the mathematics classroom, they can develop their own written problem-solving methods, which are natural and which have many strengths. By the same token, I argue that learners at the secondary level do not necessarily use the algorithms they have learned and practiced in school in their everyday life but rather rely on their own idiosyncratic algorithms. As a mathematics educator for more than three decades, I have seen that one of the problems that children face when dealing with  the  formal  school  system  is  the  difficulty  of  translating  from  different representation systems. In order to engage in self-directed   problem-solving,

children  need  to  employ  multiple  modalities  in  representing  the  problem situation (Chahine  2013)  and  be  able  to  translate  within  and  between representations, that is, from the verbal to the written, from words to symbols, from the concrete to the abstract and from the informal to the formal.

## Proportionality problems in street vending

Young street vendors are faced with proportion problems as they have to calculate the cost of several identical items or find how many things they can buy  with  a  certain  amount  of  money.  Proportions  are  also  widely  used  in scientific contexts. Despite its importance, it has been considered as one of the most difficult mathematical concepts, and this has probably made it the focus of many research studies.

Relevant literature suggested three different situation models that underlie proportion problems, namely, the isomorphism of measures, the product of measures and the multiple proportions model (Jitendra et al. 2015; Vergnaud 1988). The isomorphism of measures model involves only two variables, where each value in one variable corresponds to one value in the other. This can be exemplified in a problem situation that young street vendors encounter and that  involves  the  relationship  between  the  number  of  kg  and  price.  In  the product of  measures  model  at  least  three  variables  are  involved,  the  third being the product of the other two as is illustrated for example in finding the area  of  a  rectangle.  This  situation  cannot  be  described  by  one-to-many correspondence, but rather can be represented by a Cartesian product table. The third model, multiple proportion model, is similar to the isomorphism of measures  model,  where  many  variables  are  involved.  The  isomorphism  of measures model is the simplest model and it is essentially the only model that best describes people's initial understanding of proportions (Baxter &amp; Junker 2001).  In  employing  the  isomorphism  of  measures  model,  I  argue  that  the street  vendors'  understanding  of  the  situation  is  kept  in  view  when  the mathematical relations are analysed. Each variable remains independent of the other in the vendors' conceptualisation, and parallel transformations are carried out on both variables, thus keeping their values proportional. Hence, the importance of this model is that it includes the situation meaning as well as the mathematical relations in the same representation.

Regardless of the strategies employed in calculating proportions, Tournaire and Pulos (1985) and Vergnaud (1988) spoke of two kinds of ratios that can be compared, namely, 'internal' or 'external' ratio. Comparing ratios of the same nature involves the usage of an internal ratio, whereas external ratio entails the  comparison  of  ratios  of  different  natures.  The  comparison  of  ratios, however, must be preceded by a choice of a certain strategy (Tournaire &amp; Pulos 1985). Vergnaud (1988) suggested that it is possible to identify children's strategies  in  solving  proportion  problems  by  examining  the  intermediary

calculations they carry out. He also classified solutions into three types: scalar, functional and rule of three. While scalar solutions consist of carrying parallel transformation  on  the  variables,  functional  solutions  consist  of  computing, across variables, by establishing one ratio and then using it to calculate the other ratio. It is interesting to note that the choice of a scalar or a functional solution  strategy  is  very  much  influenced  by  the  context  of  the  problem (Karplus et al. 1983) and by the numbers presented in the problem (Vergnaud 1988).

## Methodology

This  chapter  explores  the  ethnosemantic  structure  of  the  folk  arithmetic practices of young street vendors in their everyday work setting. The general methodological  approach  was  employed  in  the  open  market,  through naturalistic observation of the vendors in their work environment, and involved documenting the problem-solving behaviour on the arithmetic tasks encountered during their vending practice. Informal conversations were aimed at the collection of life stories of vendors, their cultural background and their mathematics experience in schools.

The street vending data examined in this case study were collected in the late 1990s in the Southern suburb of Beirut, the capital of Lebanon. During that period, Lebanon was a high-conflict zone recovering from the aftermath of  more  than  30  years  of  civil  war  and  military  conflicts  that  saddled  the nation's economy  and  damaged  its vital infrastructure and facilities. Furthermore, and because of political instability in the region, Lebanon was the  epicentre  of  refugees,  attracting  migrant  families  from  neighbouring countries  who  sought  refuge  in  Lebanon  escaping  political  unrest  and  a declining economy. The two markets under study were destroyed by the Israeli invasion of Beirut in 2006.

## Population and sample

Ten  vendors,  all  males,  were  systematically  sampled  from  a  population  of 25 young vendors from two market settings in the southern suburbs of Beirut: four vendors from market 1 and six vendors from market 2. The selected young vendors had at least 3 years of schooling and 1 to 8 years of vending experience. They were 10 to 16 years of age and worked 7 days per week with an average of 10 h per day. The two markets where the vendors worked attracted a large number of migrant workers who come from Syria and other neighbouring Arab countries in conflict areas and who fled because of political and economic instability.  Because  of  poverty  and  lack  of  essential  resources  for  survival, family members as well as children as young as 7 years of age work as street vendors to support their families.

Street vendors usually have their own three-wheel carriages on which to display their produce. At one side of each carriage, there is a small cupboard in which the vendors kept the scales, weights as well as plastic bags. Carriages and tables  are  arranged  in  such  a  way  to  make  paths  for  people  to  walk. Beside each vendor's spot, empty boxes and cages are piled. The boxes and cages  originally  contained  the  produce  they  bought  from  the  wholesale market. Each day, the empty cages and boxes are returned to the wholesale market to bring new packed ones.

## Methods

The study employed two methodological approaches. In the informal setting, the  'naturalistic  approach'  was  conducted  by  'direct  observations'  (Hintze, Volpe  &amp;  Shapiro  2002:993)  of  the  vendors  as  they  carry  out  their  work activities  in  order  to  document  their  behaviour  as  they  engage  in  solving arithmetic  tasks  executed  during  daily  transactions.  Four  data  collection techniques  were  used:  participant  observation,  interviews,  collection  of artefacts and testing.

Participant observation required the researcher to play a dual role, being simultaneously involved in the activity of vendors as an insider while detached enough to allow reflection as an outsider. In the informal setting, that is, in the marketplace,  I  posed  as  a  customer  asking  questions  regarding  possible transactions to purchase produce from the vendors. I also noted transactions carried  out  by  the  vendors  selling  other  customers.  As  a  customer,  I  also interviewed the vendors in their workplace setting, that is, the marketplace where I asked successive questions about the prices of fruits and vegetables in an attempt to make a purchase or a possible purchase. For example, I asked questions like 'how much have you sold today?', 'how was the market today, was it good or bad?' or 'have you changed your prices today?' I also asked questions to initiate a transaction such as 'I want x kg, how much do these cost?' or 'you bought x kg from wholesale market and you sold y kg, then how many kg are left?' or even questions concerning profit and loss such as 'by how much you increase or decrease your prices so as to maximize profit and minimize loss?'

I  also presented the vendors with a written set of exercises, which were extracted from the transactions conducted by the vendors in the market as they attempt to make a sale or a possible sale. It is important to note here that a  transaction  involved  more  than  one  mathematical  operation.  This  was because of the fact that vendors used more than a step to obtain an answer and  each  step  employed  was  considered  a  written  computation  exercise. Problems were presented as either computation exercises or word problems. Written and oral communication with the vendors was conducted in Arabic, the mother tongue of the vendors.

Being, becoming and belonging: The ethnosemantic structure of folk arithmetic of street vendors

Artefacts  were  also  collected,  which  reflect  aspects  of  the  vendors' experience and knowledge. These included pieces of papers where vendors wrote their solutions and pictures of the scales and weights used in vending.

## Procedure

Prior  to  data  collection,  vendors  were  informed  about  the  study  and parents'  consent  was  sought  as  some  of  the  vendors  worked  with  their families. I had several informal conversations with the young vendors and their families in the market, collecting their life stories and exploring their school experience and their mathematics learning in school contexts. After these informal conversations and before conducting the semi-structured interviews, I  observed the vendors each working at his own spot. These observations provided some information about their interactions with the customers and the types of computations they used when carrying out their transactions.

## Data analysis

The unit of analysis selected was the problem-solving behaviour elicited when vendors  encountered  transactions  in  the  market.  Analytic  induction  was employed  as  the  main  analysis  approach,  which  entailed  an  in-depth examination  of  the  computational  heuristics  the  vendors  used  as  they performed their sales. The main purpose of this procedure was to generate a universal descriptive model that encompassed and explained all instances of the vendors' problem-solving behaviours transpiring in the informal setting. Two  preliminary  patterns  of  categories  were  extracted  after  coding  the interview transcriptions and field notes and clustering initial and axial codes into concepts with the same underlying meaning. The first pattern pertained to  the  problem-solving  behaviour  of  vendors  on  word  problems  and  the second described their problem-solving behaviour on computation exercises. The coding system for word problems was identical to that describing the solution strategies in the workplace setting. The other system was completely different; it was rather based on error patterns that represented major coding categories.  Data  were  assigned  to  these  categories  in  order  to  test  their workability.  After  several  iterations  and  reformulations,  different  levels  of categories and subcategories were developed.

## Results

As a result of analysis, it was evident that the vendors' self-directed problemsolving  behaviour  comprised  three  major  heuristics,  three  computational strategies  and  11  computational  sub-strategies.  These  heuristics,  strategies and sub-strategies involved a combination of standard school-taught

algorithms and nonstandard procedures invented by vendors in their work setting. It was possible to classify the heuristics used by vendors into three main categories: (1) building-up, (2) multiplicative, and (3) unit-driven. Also, combinations of these three heuristics were noted. It is worth mentioning here that the problem type influenced greatly the heuristic vendors used.

Building-up was the most frequently used heuristic by the vendors, and it did lead to successful solutions in problems involving one arithmetic operation. Of the heuristics used by vendors, 66% were building-up with a significantly high percentage of correct answers, namely, 92%. In fact, the ease with which problems  were  solved  when  using  building-up  heuristic  suggests  that  this heuristic had been related more to the situational meaning of the problems rather than to the simple manipulation of symbols.

## Type of heuristics employed

## Multiplicative heuristics

In this heuristic, the terms within a ratio were related multiplicatively, and then, this  relation  was  extended  to  the  second  ratio.  Most  of  the  time,  the  relationships were  established  between  the  numerators  and  denominators  across  or between  ratios.  Seemingly,  solving  problems  using  this  heuristic  entailed finding a relation between the first pair of numbers and then transferring this relation  to  the  second  pair.  The  relation  was  often  a  ratio  simplified  to  X:1 where X is the retail price of 1 kg. Once the ratio was identified, it could be transferred to the second pair through multiplication. Multiplicative heuristic could be exemplified in the dialogue when I (I) approached Masri (M) selling 15 kg of eggplants for a restaurant, charging 1000 L.L./kg:

I: 'How much did 15 kg cost?' M: '15000' I: 'How did you know?' M: '1 kg for 1000 then 100 kg for 100000' I: 'Did you use addition, multiplication, or division?' M: 'I didn't multiply nor subtract, I said 1 kg for 1 then 2 kg for 2, there is no need to be mixed-up.'

In another interview, and as mentioned elsewhere (Jurdak &amp; Shahin 1999), I approached Ahmad (A) selling cucumbers:

- I: 'You are selling 1 kg of cucumbers for 1250 L.L, I will take 4 kg. How much do I owe you?'

A (quickly): '5000 L.L.'

- I: 'How did you know?'
- A: '4 of 250 L.L gives 1000 L.L and 4000 L.L, hence I want 5000 L.L.'

Here, the comparison had been set between ratios of quantities of different attributes, namely, price and weight, and hence, ratios are said to be 'external' or 'functional'. Functional in the sense that what we really had was a quotient

relating to two different variables or a function ratio. Thus, it was evident that, in using a multiplicative heuristic, the vendor had reached a functional solution.

It is interesting to note that the multiplicative heuristic was less employed than the building-up heuristic for it only represented 20% of the heuristics used. Of the problems solved by vendors using this heuristic, 79% were correct. The infrequent use of this heuristic may be because of the fact that vendors tended to avoid working with multiplication, as one vendor indicated: 'we use addition because it is faster and easier, because sometimes we have many customers  buying  and  we  have  to  serve  them  all  and  multiplication  takes time'.

## Unit-driven heuristic

This heuristic was prevalent when given the cost of N kg, the vendor had to find the cost of X kg; a multi-unit problem where the unit weight was not 1 kg. In fact, the vendors' decision on the possibility and feasibility of the solution is  driven by the unit weight given. Perceiving the unit as 1 kg did not help always in finding an appropriate and reasonable solution to the problem. In contrast, thinking of N kg as a unit allowed the vendors not only to solve the problem  but  also  to  generate  many  results  by  building-up  from  the  initial solution. This could be clarified by the following interview with Ali who was selling oranges, 1 ½ kg for 1000 L.L.:

I: 'I want 3 kg; how much do I have to pay?' Ali (quickly): '2000 L.L.'

Ali successfully solved the problem by considering 1 ½ kg as a unit rather than 1 kg, then by successively adding the cost of 1 ½ kg twice, he built up his solution strategy to calculate the cost of 3 kg.'

I: 'What if I wanted 10 kg?'

Ali: 'It does not work, you can take 9 kg for 6000 L.L., either 9 or 10 ½ I: 'Why?'

kg.'

Ali: 'Because then we would have to work with small unit currency.'

It is almost as if the solution process is revealed in finding an appropriate unit to the problem.

It is important to mention that the structure of the problem did not always lead to the vendors' choice of this heuristic. For those who did use it, prices were mostly predetermined and when asked to explain their solution, they simply claimed that they have worked through taking multiples (doubling) and sub-multiples (halving) of the unit weight and accordingly computed the price. The others simply gave a reasonable estimate of the required retail price by finding the cost of 1 kg, thus considering cost (1 kg) as a unit price and building-up their solution. For example, Sami was selling 3 kg of oranges for 1000 L.L., I asked him to find the cost of 4 kg, he explained: 'since 3 kg cost

1000 L.L. then 1 kg will cost 350 L.L.' When asked how he found out the answer, he replied: 'for 3 ½ and 3 ½ and 3 ½ makes approximately 1000'.

## Combination of heuristics

It  is  worth  noting  that  some  vendors  used  a  combination  of  different heuristics  within  the  same  problem,  but  the  occurrence  or  usage  of  such combinations was minimal. Seven out of the 142 problems solved by the vendors  involved  successful  combinations  of  scalar-functional  solutions. Also,  18  problems  were  solved  through  a  combination  of  unit-driven  and scalar solution, 17 of which were correct. No combination of unit-driven and functional solutions was noted.

A combination of functional-scalar  solution  was  exemplified  by  Mohammed's attempt  to  calculate  the  retail  price  of  7 ½ kg  of  apples,  1000  L.L./kg,  he explained: '1 kg for 1000 then 7 kg for 7000 and half a kg for 500, then 7 ½ kg cost 7500 L.L.'. Thus, he partitioned his solution into functional, obtaining the cost of 7 kg through multiplication, and scalar, finding the price of ½ a kg that was 500 and then successively adding it to 7000 L.L. in order to calculate the cost of 7 kg.

In contrast, vendors also employed a combination of unit-driven scalar solutions.  For  instance,  to  calculate  the  cost  of  15  kg  of  oranges,  1 ½ kg /1000 L.L., Wael simply built up his solution by working his way through taking 1 ½ kg as a unit of weight and successively adding the corresponding retail price. He proceeded as follows: '1 ½ kg for 1000 L.L. then 4 ½ kg will cost 3000 L.L., 10 ½ for 7000, 7 and 3 makes 10 ... then 15 kg cost 10000 L.L., I just added'.

An important result was the fact that the same vendor used two different solutions for solving two proportion problems involving the same numbers. This was clear, for example, when Masri was computing the cost of 2 ½ kg of tomatoes, 1000 L.L. / kg, he said: '1 kg for 1000 L.L. then 2 ½ kg will cost 2500 L.L.', thus using a functional solution. In another occasion, when asked about the cost of 2 ½ kg of cucumbers, 1000 L.L. /kg, he explained: '1 kg for 1000 L.L. and 1 kg for 1000 L.L. then 2 kg cost 2000 L.L. and ½ kg in 500 L.L. hence 2500 L.L.', thus using a scalar solution. Hence, there was no single specific heuristic that any of the vendors adopted, but there was a clear preference for using building-up heuristic.

## Counting-up

Vendors  used  counting-up  by  hundreds,  tens  and  one's  as  a  self-directed problem-solving  technique  to  approach  an  originally  subtraction  problem. They started with the smaller addend and counted up to the larger one, a

Being, becoming and belonging: The ethnosemantic structure of folk arithmetic of street vendors general, powerful and rapid means of finding answers to take-away problems. This could be seen in an interview with Wael (W):

- I: 'How many cages have you bought from the wholesale market?'
- W: '14 cages'
- I: 'How many cages have you sold till now?'
- W: 'I don't know'
- I: 'How many cages are left?'
- W (pause): 'Nine cages.'
- I: 'Okay, there remains 9 cages and you have bought 14 cages, then how many have you sold?'
- W: 'Nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, ... then I sold 5.'

Of the 32 subtraction problems solved orally by the vendors, it was possible to  identify  15  clear  examples  of  counting-up.  There  were  13  responses  for which the vendors did not provide an explanation of how they achieved the result, most probably utilising number facts and four other problem solutions that were obtained through subtractive distribution. Of the responses to the change problems obtained through counting-up, 93% were correct.

Such  counting  skills,  though  considered  elementary,  have  helped  the vendors  acquire  some  sound,  intuitive  understandings  about  addition  and subtraction. In fact, vendors' use of this strategy represented their attempt to make use of what they have already known to solve novel problems. In doing so,  they  have  established  strong  links  between  addition  and  subtraction operations, which in turn facilitated the learning of subtraction facts in relation to addition facts. A problem such as 10 000 L.L. - 3000 L.L., for instance, was thought of by Mohammed as '3000 L.L. and how many more L.L. to make 10  000  L.L.?'.  Hence,  addition  and  subtraction  are  thought  of  as  related operations.

## Repeated grouping

Rather  than  approaching  multiplication  problems  algorithmically,  vendors used their knowledge about numbers and operations to choose a method appropriate to the problem at hand. Two computational sub-strategies were identified to address these types of questions, namely, 'convenient chunking' and distribution.

## Convenient chunking

When finding the retail  price  of  5  kg  of  potatoes  knowing  that  1  kg  costs 750 L.L., instead of multiplying 5 by 750, Wael added the retail price of 4 kg to the retail price of 1 kg, he explained: '2 kg cost 1500 then 4 kg cost 3000 L.L.  hence 5 kg will cost 3750 L.L.' As such, the values added represented convenient chunks that were easier to operate on than the multiplicands 5 and 750. Through constant monitoring, Wael kept track of intermediary products

towards a solution. Calculation was completed when the proper number of 'times' has been added. The specific chunks chosen seemed to depend on both  the  numbers  involved  and  the  vendors'  knowledge  of  number  facts. Grouping 50's into 100's and 100's to 1000's brought an obvious advantage to their computations. But the process was even richer as vendors took some shortcuts to the solutions and it was not clear how to predict the number of chunks used. For instance, in finding the retail price of 10 kg of oranges, Wael worked out the subtotals of 5 chunks, each representing the cost of 2 kg. On another occasion, when finding the retail price of 10 kg of oranges also, where 1 kg cost 750 L.L., he successively added price (4 kg) plus price (4 kg) plus price (2 kg), hence chunking 10 into 4, 4 and 2.

Grouping numbers into convenient chunks clearly showed that the vendors had  kept  the  meaning  of  the  problem  in  mind  while  attempting  to  find  a solution.  They  repeatedly  referred  to  the  parameters  in  the  problem  while mentally  calculating.  This  was  noticeable  in  multiplication  problems  where convenient  chunking  represented  79%  of  the  computational  sub-strategies used under repeated grouping.

## Distribution

The  distribution  computational  sub-strategy  was  detected  when  vendors transformed one of the multiplicands into a series of either sums or differences. Calculations were then proceeded by applying either additive, subtractive or 'fractional'  distribution.  Additive  distribution  was  based  on  the  principle  of distributive  law  of  multiplication  over  addition.  Fractional  distribution  was usually applied to those tasks in which at least one factor contained 5 as a unit digit. Finally, the subtractive distribution sub-strategy was implemented using the distribution principle of multiplication over subtraction. Unintentionally, vendors sometimes expressed a factor as a difference of two numbers thus simplifying calculations.

## Problem-solving behaviour when solving computation exercises

When solving  written  mathematical  operation  problems,  vendors  failed  to deal with decontextualised numbers. Some were unable to read or write the numbers accurately, many lacked the basic understanding of the operations themselves,  others  became  careless  and  confused,  still  others  had  special problems  with  language  or  in  relating  representations,  symbols  and  even writing a numeral correctly. For example, Masri could count by ones and tens, knew  which  numbers  were  greater  in  magnitude  than  others,  could  add mentally and multiply using repeated addition, yet Masri could not write any mathematical symbol or numeral correctly. Detailed examination of vendors'

Being, becoming and belonging: The ethnosemantic structure of folk arithmetic of street vendors written solutions of computation exercises afforded the detection of certain routines related to reading and writing numbers. It was possible to classify these routines into three categories: random handling of numerals, difficulty in specifying multiples of 10 and idiosyncratic interpretation of symbols.

## Random handling of numerals

When writing or reading numbers, seven out of the 10 vendors did, occasionally, reverse digits of numbers. For example, when adding 12 + 12, mentally, Wael got 24 as an answer but wrote 42. Also, Ali subtracted 1000 from 7000 and obtained  6000  as  an  answer,  which  he  wrote  as  0006.  In  addition,  some vendors  tended  to  write  the  numbers  differently  than  they  say  them.  For instance, when Masri was adding 6000 and 6000 his answer was 12 000 but he wrote 16. Furthermore, vendors tended, at certain times, to write a number the same way as they say it. For example, adding 2250 and 1500 mentally, Masri got 3750 as an answer so he wrote 3 000 750, which was exactly the way he operated on the numbers when adding from left to right. It is important to  note  here  that  the  difficulties  most  students  faced  in  writing  a  numeral could be because of the discrepancy in the Arabic writing between digits and letters.  In  Arabic,  the  direction  of  text  writing  proceeds  from  right  to  left whereas in writing the digits of a number starting from the most significant digit to the ones digit, that is, from left to right.

## Difficulty in specifying multiples of 10

This habit was the most prevalent for, eight out of the 10 vendors made errors in  reading  or  writing  numbers ending with a zero. For instance, Wael read 1000 as '10' and 10 000 as '100', while 2250 was read as '250'. Wael also wrote 1500 but read it as 'one and a half million'.

## Idiosyncratic interpretation of operation symbols

Vendors had their own interpretation of the operation symbols +, -, ×. For example, Hasan was trying to add horizontally 1000 + 500 and then to write his response. Instead of writing the operation symbol '+' for addition, he simply drew a line. Also, this habit was noted in Masri's use of the symbols '=' and ' ≠ ' as alternatives to '+'.

It appeared from the practice that vendors' used to read and write their solutions to computation  exercises  that  they  have  not  retained  basic knowledge of the mathematical symbol system used in schools. The difficulties that vendors encountered can be attributed to their lack of expertise in solving problems  using  symbols,  a  skill  that  is  necessary  to  abstractly  solve  pure arithmetic operation exercises.

## Discussion

Investigations of computations in everyday settings have provided important suggestions  for  interpreting  the  empirical  findings  of  this  study.  These empirical results further confirm that it is one thing to learn mathematics in schools  and  quite  another  thing  to  solve  problems  in  real  life  situations. Upon examining the self-directed problem-solving behaviour of street vendors in their workplace setting, it was clear that the computational strategies they created in the course of work transcended the formal strategies learned in school in terms of efficiency and accuracy. Admittedly, the vendors' use of informal computational strategies at work involved an in-depth understanding of the problem situation in a way, which rendered it meaningful. As a result, they kept the meaning of the problem in mind during problem-solving at work and  quite often seemed  to  forget  about  this  meaning  when  solving decontextualised exercises. It appeared that when solving pure computation exercises, the formal symbolism of arithmetic had moved the vendors away from their natural and intuitive problem-solving skills that were secured in the real-world experiences and towards rules of meaningless symbol manipulation. As  a  result,  the  vendors'  mathematical  understanding  seems  to  be  split between the concrete and the written, as if their problem-solving behaviour inhabited two different worlds, each with its own rules and strategies but with different connection between the two. This marked within-vendors' difference in performance when using formal and informal computational strategies can be attributed to the impact of two activity systems that the vendors engage in: one related to work and the other related to schooling. The computational fluency  that  the  vendors  acquired  through  their  vending  experiences  had some unique characteristics that showed the imprint of the market on the mathematical  ideas  that  were  developed  there,  which  were  different  from what  prevail  in  typical  mathematics  textbooks.  Seemingly,  street  vending afforded  the  vendors  with  a  number  of  challenges  and  opportunities  to develop  conceptual  understanding  that  consequently  resulted  in  a  more effective self-directed problem-solving on computational transactions. As a result, vendors consolidated a database of meaningful computational strategies and self-invented arithmetic algorithms. Such a finding supports the  claim  that,  when  children  understand  a  problem,  they  are  capable  of creating, on their own, a method to solve that problem.

In contrast, the role of schooling  in the development  of  vendors' mathematical  knowledge  was  not  a  clear  and  simple  one.  While  the performance of the vendors that were still in school was significantly higher on  school-type  algorithms  than  that  of  the  vendors  that  dropped  out  of school, error rates associated with the use of written computational strategies seemed to increase considerably. It could be argued that students who did not experience a mathematical concept in multiple situations may take several

years to be comfortable with school-type arithmetic concepts, like place value notation and column algorithms in which one operates on symbols rather than on quantities. Findings of this study show that vendors with relatively high levels of schooling begin to distance themselves from the characteristics of the sale situations in which they work and engage in analysing their sales in terms of more abstract notions. This perhaps was the main endowment that school has provided vendors who are still attending school, which was a deficit for their peers who were out of school and whose computational strategies were  strictly  tied  to  specific  vending  situations.  Thus,  while  schools  may promote the generation of general solutions, which are removed from specific situations; however, it seems that the cost of leaving the specific situation and generalising can be high. It is reasonable, then, to argue that school and work could be connected to self-directed problem-solving behaviour, which had influenced  the  vendors'  performance  in  the  formal  and  informal  settings. Vendors who were still attending school fared better than those who dropped school, only on pure computation exercises. This could imply that schooling had  improved  the  vendors'  performance  only  in  relation  to  the  means  of representation  used  in  school.  Schooling  had  a  minimal  effect  on  the performance of vendors who dropped out of school. In contrast, street vending afforded young vendors a context where they developed expertise as selfdirected  learners,  engaged  in  the  workplace  environment  as  independent thinkers addressing ensuing problems and making connections between the abstract and the applied knowledge.

As a matter of fact, and drawing from Engeström's (1999) first-, secondand third-generation activity systems analysis, it might be argued that the mathematical  goals  in  school  are  distinct  from  those  undertaken  in  the vendors' practice at work. The principle motive of vendors is to make money, and  therefore,  the  self-directed  solutions  adopted  at  work  may  not  be, principally, mathematical. Furthermore, the vendors' motivation to engage in any  computational  transaction  is  derived  from  their  performance  as  selfdirected  learners  driven  by  curiosity,  challenge  and  control.  Being  fully  in charge of their  own  thought  processes,  it  is  easy  to  discern  then  that  the young practitioners were able to enrich their problem-solving behaviour and to  employ  mathematical  ideas  malleably  to  their  advantage  in  the  ever changing and challenging workplace context.

In contrast, in school, mathematics is the object of study, and therefore, rather than being motivated by economic concerns, students in school may strive to do well on a test and to abide by rules of accuracy and precision. This difference in motives between work and school could imply that mathematical errors  take  on  different  meanings  across  the  two  contexts.  When  solving problems in  the  vending  practice,  vendors  were  often  not  concerned  with achieving  mathematically  exact  solutions  to  problems,  whereas  in  the classroom,  error  is  evaluated  with  reference  to  mathematical  standards.

Moreover, social interactions contribute to the differential impact of vending and schooling. In vending, interactions are often between equals, either with other vendors or with customers, these are interactions for the purpose of doing their business. Furthermore, the vendors have the ultimate say on what determines the appropriate way to sell, it is the vendor himself who bears the loss or profit of his selling efforts, this loss or gain is linked to his mathematical proficiency. However, in school, interactions are set between the student and the teacher for only one purpose, namely to provide opportunities for learning for  its  own  sake.  Brockett  and  Hiemstra  (1991:32)  reminded  us  that  SDL activities  'cannot  be  divorced from the social context in which they occur' because 'the social context provides the arena in which the activity of selfdirection is played out'.

## Conclusion

The ethnosemantic structure of the arithmetic of street vending could highlight questions related to which mathematical knowledge and competencies are valued, which groups are deemed doers of mathematics and what purposes does  mathematics  teaching  and  learning  serve  within  and  across  cultural contexts. Many of the questions are at the heart of the debate on the role of mathematics in preparing the 21st-century workforce that is capable of selfdirected,  lifelong  learning  and  that  is  fully  equipped  with  a  new  set  of foundational  knowledge  and  skills  to  solve  challenging  problems.  In  this context, success in mathematics ensues not just from what one knows, but what one can do with that knowledge in and outside of formal school settings. In  being,  becoming  and  belonging,  and  as  Brookfield  (1985)  made  it  clear from the outset:

[ T/thinspace ]he  external  technical  and  the  internal  reflective  dimensions  are  fused  when adults come to appreciate the culturally constructed nature of knowledge. In such a praxis of thought and action is manifested a fully adult form of autonomous, selfdirected learning. (p. 31)

This book on self-directed learning (SDL) is devoted to original academic scholarship within the field of education. In this book, the authors explored how self-directed learning can be considered  an  imperative  for  education  in  a  complex  modern  society.  Although  each chapter represents independent research in the field of SDL, the chapters form a coherent contribution concerning the scholarship of SDL and specifically the effect of environmental and praxis contexts on the enhancement of SDL in a complex society. Scholars working in a wide range of fields are drawn together in this scholarly work to present a comprehensive dialogue regarding SDL and how this concept functions in a complex and dynamic higher education context. This book presents a combination of theory and practice, which reflects selected  conceptual  dimensions  of  SDL  in  society  as  well  as  research-based  findings pertaining to current topical issues relating to implementing SDL in the modern world. The varied methodologies provide the reader with different and balanced perspectives, as well as varied innovative ideas on how to conduct research in the field of SDL.

Self-Directed Learning: An imperative for education in a complex society does a splendid job of providing strong evidence for SDL as a way to prepare students with 21st-century skills, enabling them to be ready for the workforce where creativity, critical thinking, and problemsolving are paramount to success in creating innovations that will change the landscape of all societies. This book is an important one, as it provides diverse perspectives on SDL in multiple contexts. From street vendors' arithmetic skills to problem-based learning in chemistry, the book sets up for a healthy dialogue to ensure the regard of SDL and how it can occur in multiple ways, places, and contexts. The book offers multiple chapters examining SDL. The most  powerful  chapter  showcases  the  street  knowledge  of  vendors  and  their  ability  to execute mathematical functions compared to those within formal schooling. The qualitative methods used for this chapter afforded the reader a vivid portrait of how mathematics can be an  integral  part  of  a  person's  life  when  placed  within  the  context  of  everyday  life.  The examples of the street knowledge provided throughout this chapter are powerful and full of wisdom, and align with the mathematics standards released years ago, proposing teachers afford  students  the  chance  for  multiple  ways  of  problem  solving  instead  of  using  one formulaic  method.  This  chapter,  in  particular,  will  empower  the  re-examining  of  teaching practices away from the abstract and into the actual way students 'think' about doing math. Researching student thinking is a powerful way to examine all subject matter and needs to be emphasised more in educational literature. This book will be an invaluable addition to the literature  on  self-directed  learning  and  the  research  practices  that  best  showcase  how  to analyse and interpret this complex phenomenon.
