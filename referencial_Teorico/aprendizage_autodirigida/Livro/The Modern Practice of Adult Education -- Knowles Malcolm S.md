## Preparing Yourself

## to Inquire

## Setting a Climate tor Inquiry

This book, if ít practices what it preaches, should be a adult-learning experience for you; the reader. Since I believe that the single most effective teaching device available to teachers is the example of their own behavior, I shall do my best to make this book a example of an adult-learning experience. good good

So if this book ís to serve as a learning experience for you; we must at the outset establish a climate of mutual inquiry, And as we shall see later, I believe that this is the first step in developing any experience. learning

But this won't be easy to attain, because at its best; an adult-learning experience should be a process of self-directed inquiry, with the resources of the teacher, fellow students, and materials available to the learners but not imposed on them\_ The learners should be active participants; discovering for themselves those are ready to discover at a particular phase of their personal development. But people typically don't read books in this spirit:. read books as listen to lectures-~to get answers to questions the author thinks are important rather than to explore quesbeen trained to read books rather than to with them. goal being they They they dialogue

Now what, exactly, is involved in establishing a climate of mutual inquiry in book? Im not sure I know. Plato did it by actually in the form of dialogues between teachers and students. But this technique seems more appropriate to sophical inquiry than to the more technological inquiry covered in this book. writing philo - for this kind of book the most important aspects of the climate are the attitudes of the author and reader. Speaking for myself, my attitude is that of a helper to you; not as your teacher in the traditional sense. I perceive you as to this book for help in discovering better ways to perform whalever adult-educationa] func tions you are responsible for at this time and perhaps in the future: For some readers these functions will be different from those of others; and I shall try to resist the temptation to put you all in the same mold. I also perceive you as bringing a variety of experiences; previous training and of view about society and education to the reading of this book. I bring my experience; training; and of view to the of it:. I shall present my ideas with conviction and enthusiasm, not with the attitude that are the truth or the best ideas but in the that will provide a framework with which you can compare and test your own ideas. My attitude is that I am my experience; training; and point of view with you rather than imposing them on you: This set of attitudes on my sets up some requirements regarding your attiPerhaps coming points point writing hope they sharing Part

By this I mean that I am expecting you to look to this book to help you formulate questions about your practices as an adult educator to which you will then seek answers from many sources; including this book; other books, training programs; colleagues; and above all, your own experimentation: An attitude of gentle skepticism would probably also be helpful. I shall feel less inhibited about expressing my ideas, assumptions; and convictions clearly and forcefully if I can rely on you to test them your experience, to those that make sense to you; and to build on them creatively. against adopt

Another aspect of the climnate of this mutual inquiry that I think is important for education of adults is as old as civilization; and adult education as an identifable field of study and practice has celebrated its silver anniversary, the notion that there is distinct and diferent technology for adult learning is in its very beginning stages of development:. Consequently, what we know about how to help adults lear is largely the product of artistic experience; and ou are categories we use to organize them (such as the typology of techniques in Chapter 1l) are crude and constantly changing We must await a deal more research before we can start about the scientific foundation of our technology of adult educa tion. But for adventurous souls with high tolerance for ambiguity, this is the most exciting phase in the evolution of a new discipline. So our climate must be character ized by a willingness to take risk, to experiment to leam from our mistakes; and to construct theories that we know will have to be modifed.

## How the Inqulry Is Organlzed

This inquiry is organized into three parts. Part I attempts to out into the open certain assumnptions about the emerging role and technology of adult education 'modern practice." Chapter 3 presents assumptions about who adult educators really are (including the assumption that there are many more of us than any statistics show), what their mission is as social practitioners, and what their role is becoming and must become in our changing society  Chapter 4 is a highly personal statement of a beginning about adult learning for which I have borrowed the label "andragogy" from my European colleagues; I am not sure, of course; that all the assumptions in Part I are rght. But are there to be challenged; tested, and modified through the process of have made difference in my own practice; have given me the security of knowing what I am doing and why I am doing it and have brought a sense of consistency to my actions. bring theory they your

Part II constitutes a kind of how-to-do-it manual for applying the principles of andragogy to the organization and administration of comprehensive programs of adult There is one chapter for each phase of the andragogical process: establishing climate and structure; assessing needs and interests; defining purposes and objectives, constructing 9 design; operating the program; and evaluating the results. This section is Liberally illustrated with examples of materials developed by a variety of institutions; not all of which are equally congruent with andragogical principles\_a fact that prelearning;

sents the reader with the opportunity to take a clinical rather than an imitative stance toward the illustrations.

Several appendices have been added to provide illustrative material that might interfere with the fow of the text if included in the chapters. Because andragogy is a new word to American readers and has such a central place in this book, and because etymologists tend to take a critical stance toward the formation of new linguistic forms; Ihave included in Appendix A a reproduction of my correspondence with the publish ers of Merriam-Webster dictionaries regarding "andragogy?

Part III traces the application of the same basic process of adult education to the helping adults learn; in contrast to the pedagogical spirit of teaching adults. 1l carries the full weight of this part of the inquiry . Chapter

The Emerging Role and Technology of Adult Education

## What Is Modern Practice?

## In a World of Accelerating Change

As I reflect back on nearly five decades as a worker in the vineyards of adult education; it ís clear to me that each decade witnessed more changes in the theoretical materials of our feld than the preceding decade. Adult educators who the prac tices in the seventies that had learned in the sixties were inefective and archaic. "Modern is thus a very temporary state. My own assessment is that the half-life of current practices is about a decadethat half of the practices become outdated over the course of ten years. So about half of this book had to be rewritten when 1 revised the 1970 edition: used they

What are the main ideas that are infuencing~or will influenceadult-education practices in the eighties and nineties? I can observe several in my feld of vision.

One of the reassuring features of this process of change; however, is that the basic concepts and assumptions about adult learners and adult learning that have been through our stream of thought for half a century have remained intact; it is remarkable that the propositions made by Eduard C. Lindeman in 1926 in his The Meaning of Adult Education have been largely supported ~and enriched\_by experience and research ever since.

## New Conceptlon ot the Purpose of Educatlon

Ferhaps most fundamental of all the current thrusts on our thinking is the reexamination of our notions about the very purpose of education: The dominant conception about the mission of education until recently has been to produce what in the literature is most often called 'the educated man In our era of Women's Lib we would prefer the terminology 'the knowledgeable person.~ The faith has been that if we simply pour enough knowledge into people: 1) wil] turn out to be people, and 2) will know how to make use of their knowledge. This faith may knowledge and technology changed very gradually and in an era in which education was considered a right and privilege for essentially an elite leisured class. good they \_ they

But in an era of knowledge explosion; technological revolution; and a social policy of equality of educational opportunity; this definition of the purpose of education and this faith in the power of transmitted knowledge are no longer appropriate. We now know that in the world of the future we must defne the mission of education as to produce competent people who are able to their knowledge under changing conditions; and we know that the foundational competence all people must have is the competence to engage in self-directed now know, also, that the way to produce competent people is to have them acquire their knowledge (and skills; understandings, attitudes; values, and interests) in the context of its application. people apply Lifelong\_ learning We

Hence the accelerating in the seventies and eighties of competency-based education. (I tend to agree with Cyril Houle that a more descriptive label would be 'performance-based education" 'competency-based education that has caught on.) Not only are competency models beginning to content-transmission objectives as the basis for organizing curricula but self-paced individualized learning modules (or learning packages) and learning contracts are replacing course outlines as the modes for structuring learning experiences. This new way of thinking about education has drastic implications for the education of children and youth, but it seems to be especially relevant to a field of practice that has responsibility to help adults live productively in a world of accelerating change. spread replace

## From a Focus on Teaching to a Focus on Learning

A second thrust in our thinking is a shift in our research and practice away from a focus on teaching to psychologists (with the exception of Piaget and Bruner) gave their attention almost exclusively to studying the reactions of children to teaching; and schools of education gave their attention primarily to training teachers how to control students' reactions to ability to conceptualize and Tough's finding that adults go through a natural sequence of steps when undertake to lear something on their own; we to be interested in finding out more about the natural processes of -focusing oD what happens inside the leamer rather than on what the teacher does: Out of this of thinking came a new emphasis on education as process of facilitating directed and a redefinition of the role of teacher as a facilitator of self-directed learning and a resource to self-directed learners. began they learning \_ self c learning

## Lilelong Learning

A third thrust is the injection into our thinking of the concept of lifelong learning as the organizing principle for all of education. The basic premise underlying this of thought is that in a world of accelerating change must be a process:. Therefore; schooling must be concerned primarily with developing the skills of inquiry , and adult education must be primarily concerned with providing the resources and support for self-directed inquirers. Jine learning lifelong

## New Delivery Systems

Infuenced strongly by all of these forces is a fourth thrust-~a concern for developing new ways to deliver educational services to individuals so that leamning throughout their lives at their convenience in terms of time and place: Among the labels being given to these new delivery systems are 'nontraditional study;' 'exterthey

These labels represent more than just a random series of innovative experiments; to a new direction in OW thinking about how and where is no longer   seen as the monopoly of educational institutions and their teachers. We now perceive that resources for learning are everywhere in our environment and that people can get help in their learning a variety of other The modern task of education; therefore, becomes one of fnding new ways to link learners with learning resources. they point from people

From the of view of determining what individuals should be treated as adults educationally; it seems to me the two critical questions that should be asked are: I) who behaves as an adult -who performs adult roles?

## What Is Adult Education?

People have little difficulty getting a clear picture of what elementary education is (it is what goes on in the red brick building with little children) or what secondary education is (it is what goes on with adolescents in those near the football stadium) or what higher education is (it is what goes on in those enormous and university complexes; with youth) . But adult education is much harder to picture. It takes place in all sorts of buildings and even in no buildings at all, involves all sorts of has no set curriculum; and often isn't even labeled 'adult educabut such as 'staf development;" 'develop'inservice education, 'continuing education, education, and many others. bigger buildings college things

One problem contributing to the confusion is that the term 'adult education is used with at least three different meanings. In its broadest sense, the\_term descrbes a process experiences of mature men and women by which acquire new knowledge, understanding; skills; attitudes; interests; or values. It is a process that is used by adults for their self-development; both alone and with others; and it is used by institutions of all kinds for the growth and development of their employees; members, and clients. It is educational an process that is often used in combination with production processes; political processes; or service processes. they

## Who Is an Adult Educator?

more people are adult educators than know are. If "adult educator is defined as one who has some responsibility for helping adults to learn look at how many people in this country are entitled to bear this hallmark: Many they

- tens of thousands of executives, training officers; supervisors; and foremen in business and industry, government; and social agencies;
- hundreds of thousands of program chairmen; education chairmen; and discussion leaders in such voluntary associations as women's clubs; men's clubs, service organizations, religious 'laymen's organizations; PTA's, professiona] socithe like;
- institutions as schools; colleges and universities; libraries , and commercial schools; public
- ~a few score full-time; professional adult educators who have been trained specifically for this vocation and who are making their permanent career in it.
- ~hundreds of program directors; writers; and editors in the educational aspects of such mass media as newspapers, magazines, radio, and television;

But relatively few of this vast corps are conscious that are performing the increasingly precisely defined role of adult educator. Few of them are aware that there is a growing body of knowledge and techniques that can learn to help them perform this role better. The reasons for this condilion are not hard to surmise. In the case of the of volunteer leaders, the assignment is to do a specific job in a finite period of time: 'to serve as the program chairman of the XYZ club for one yearIn the case of the executives and supervisors the assignment tends to be in terms of particular processes in particular companies: In the case of teachers the assignment tends to be in terms of subject matter: 'instructor of mathematics. The fact is, though, that to the extent that all of these assignments involve helping other adults to become more competent; have a common element-what we míght call an adult-education component. And to this extent all the people carrying these kinds of assignments are partly adult educators: they they myriad they

## What Does an Adult Educator Do?

What are the functions an adult educator performs? To answer this question it is probably  necessary to distinguish among several levels of the adult-education role;

At the firing-line level are the teachers, group leaders; and supervisors who work directly with adult learners on a face-to-face basis. Among their functions are: 1) helping the learners diagnose their needs for particular learnings within the scope of the given situation (the diagnostic function); 2) planning with the learners &amp; sequence of experiences that will produce the desired learnings (the planning function); 3) cre conditions that will cause the learners to want to learn (the motivational function); 4) selecting the most effective methods and techniques for producing the desired learnings (the methodological function); 5) providing the human and material resources ating necessary to learners measure the outcomes of the experiences (the evaluative function) learning

At the professional-leadership level ære the small group of career adult educators who are responsible for such functions as developing new knowledge; preparing mateadult-education workers; and generally promoting the further development of the field of adult education. training

At the program-director level are the committee chainmen; training directors; evening-school principals; extension deans; and other administrators who are responsible for planning and operating broad programs consisting of a variety of adult-educasocietal needs for adult learning relevant to their organizational (the development and operation of an adult-education program (the organizationa]  function); 3) formulating objectives to meet the assessed needs and designing a prograrn of activities to achieve these objectives (the planning function); 4) instituting and super those procedures required for the effective operation of a program; including recruiting and leaders and teachers; managing facilities and administrative processes, recruiting students; financing; and interpreting (the administrative function); 5) assessing the efectiveness of the program (the evaluative function) vising training

## What Is Ihe Adult Educator's Mission?

At frst sight the mission of the adult educator seems simple; to operate successful educational activities for mature men and women; success being defined in terms of the numbers and enthusiasm of the participants. But of the of the a adult-education movement in this country indicates that the mission of adult educators can best be described\_in relation to the needs and goals of institutions; and 3) the needs and goals of society: reading history

## The Needs and Goals of Individuals

The and immediate míssion primnary of every adult educator is to help individuals satisfy their needs and achieve their Usually if an individual is asked what these are; he o she will respond in terms of the acquisition of some specific competence; such as 'being able t0 speak in public' Or 'knowing mathematics. Or the person might go one level of abstraction higher to such objectives as "being able to make more money able to get with people better . These, to be sure, are impor tant incentives to but in this book are treated as 'interests rather than 'needs, a distinction that will be discussed more fully in a later chapter. Interests are relevant to the adult educator's technology; but in relation to this mission we are talking about something different and mnore fundamental indeed; about sofnething of which individuals are less conscious than are of their interests. We are talking about the more ultimate needs and of human fulfllment. goals. 'being along learning they goals

Physiological or Survival Needs

Most basic needs have to do with survival physically and psychologically.

Self-actualization means actualizing one's potential; becoming everything one is capable of becoming:

## DIMENSIONS OF MATURATION

| From   | Toward 1                                                  |
|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
|        | Dependence Autonomy 2, Passivity Activity 3. Subjeclivity |

Ferhaps the meaning of this conception of dimnensions of maturing can be made clearer by brief elaborations on them.

1. From dependence toward autonomy. All humnan beings enter this world in a completely dependent condition; their every need must be fulfilled by someone else. One of the centra] quests of their lives is for increasing self-direction (although the opposite of dependence in our complicated world may not be independence s0 much as selfdirecting interdependence). The fact is that every experience we have in life tends to affect our movement dependence toward autonomy; and to the extent that given experience helps us to move away from dependence it can be said to be educa tional, while to the extent that it tends to dependent or make us mnore depenThink of the efects on this dimension of maturing of the traditional conceptions of the roles of teacher; parent, minister, boss; and leader, which tend to put the individual ín an essentially dependent role. from keep

- 3. From subjecticity toward objecticity. It is a universal characteristic of infancy that the world revolves around 'me, takes on its meaning from 'my" perception of it; and is subject to my' make in life is to move thenselves out of the center of the universe and to discover where really ft into it. The extent to which each experience in life helps themn to look at themselves realistically, and to maintain self-respect in the process; is certainly one of the tests of its educational quality-
- 2 From passivity toward activity. Throughout childhood individuals who are maturing become increasingly active in exploring the world about themn and tend to engage in an expanding nunber of its activities. In adulthood the is likely to shift from quantitative activity to qualitative activity; but whether on qualitative basis or a quantitative basis; maturing individuals tend to be participating individuals. And the way are taught to participate in school and in other educative experiences whether are in the role of passive recipients of knowledge or in that of active inquirers after knowledge~will greatly affect the direction and of their movement in this dimension of growth. emphasis they they7 put speed
- 4. From ignorance toward enlightenment:. It is in this area of maturing that schooling has traditionally placed its emphasis. But are we clear about what 'enlightenmnent" really is? Certainly it can't be knowing everything\_the volume of modern knowledge is too vast for any individual to encompass it. In his Some Worth Knowing Stuart Chase poses this as one of the most pressing problems our civilization must solve; and he suggests one possible line of attack: He proposes that every individual should be perceived as being both specialist and need to master deeply the knowledge and skills of their vocation. But as generalists need to master and up to date on a core of knowledge from all those specialities that bear on the practical problems of life thus suggesting a kind of "core curriculum for adult education, which would consist of a distillation of the essential elements from every discipline that all citizens should know. Only through such a process as this, Chase argues, can true enlightenment be achieved. Things they keep

5. From small abilities toward abilities: There is a tendency in human nature, once we have learned to do something well, to take in that ability and to rest on the laurels it wins us. Since each newly developed ability tends to be learned in its simplest for; this tendency can result in individuals becoming frozen into the lowest level of their potential performance. A skillful facilitator of learning helps each individual to glimpse higher possible levels of performance and to develop continually larger abilities. large pride

6. From few responsibilities toward many responsibilities. Another curious tendency in human nature; especially among parents, teachers; and supervisors; is to underestimate the amount of responsibility a child, student; and subordinate can carry. And s0 the maturation process is child is prepared to take over, the teacher decisions the students are ready to make; and the supervisor carrying functions the subordinates are ready to have deleto them. making gated

7. From narrow interests toward broad interests. The child's world starts with a field of interests that is bounded by the crib, and one significant sign of a person's continuing maturation is the extension of this field in ever-widening circles for the rest of life. Anything that causes an individuals field of interests to become fixated within a given circle or to recede to smaller circles is interfering with an únportant dimension of maturation. This dimension has special relevance to work with older people; in which the myth is held that it is natural for interests to diminish with age. Gerontologists who have made the opposite assumption-that older are able to new interests and are healthier if do\_have had spectacular results. widely people develop they

8. From selfishness toward altruism.  We come into the world in a state of total selfcenteredness,  and one of our central tasks for the rest of our lives is to become increasingly able to care about others: Conditions that induce a spirit of rivalry toward others rather than helpfulness toward others~such as the competition for promoted by traditional schooling\_interfere with maturation in this dimension. Incidentally, there are some psychiatrists single best criterion of mental health. grades (e-g

9. From self-reiection toward self-acceptance. While children's frst impression of them selves is probably that are kings OF queens of the mountain; soon learn that much of their natural behavior (making noise; getting into not eating correctly, etc.) is bad. And so their attitude quickly changes from one of self-adulation to one worth (which, incidentally; is prerequisite to being able to accept others as worth). And so the extent to which subsequent Iife experiences help the individual move from self-rejection toward self-acceptance will largely determine wbether an individual matures in this dimension or not. they they things; having

10. From amorphous self-identity toward integrated self-identity . Erik Erikson has provided the deepest insights concerning this dimension of maturation, mapping out its course through the "eight ages of man; as follows:

- a)   Oral-sensory, in which the basic issue is trust vs. mistrust
- Locomotion-genital in which the basic issue is initiative vs.
- b)   Muscular-anal in which the basic issue is autonomy vs. shame\_
- in which the basic issue is industry vs. inferiority.
- Pubery and adolescence; in which the basic issue is identity vs. role confusion
- g) Adulthood, in which the basic issue is generauvity vs. stagnalion
- h) Maturity; in which the basic issue is ego-integrity vs. despair ;

Although no stage is completely fulfilled at any in life--and we continue to actualize each stage further throughout life~if development in a given stage is mostly point

frustrated; an individual is likely to remnain fixated at that stage. Erikson's concepts of the process of identity formation are far too complex and provocative to be described in this book. But perhaps this taste is sufficient to indicate that the dinension of maturation from "I dont know who I am toward "I know clearly who I am" is a delicate and crucial one.

is unique and each event is unconnected with any other. The discovery of principles enabling a person to group objects and connect events is the essence of the process of inquiry: One of the tragic aspects of traditional pedagogy is that it has so often imposed principles on inquiring minds and has therefore denied them the opportunity to mature in the ability to discover principles.

12. From superficial concerns  toward concerns.  The young child's world is an existential world; all that matters is the enjoyment of pleasure and the avoidance of at the moment.  One dimension of maturing consists of gaining perspective on what mattered more deeply in and is likely to matter more deeply in our future-~and, accomplished this feat; gaining perspective on what matters in the and future of others. Too often this process is retarded by society's trying to impose its concerns on us before we discovered our own. deep Pain past having past deep have

13. From imitation toward originality. The child's first technique of learing and ing is that of imitation The adult world has tended to accept this method of learning = as not only natural but best; and has geared much of its educatíonal to produce conformity through imitation. The consequence has been the retardation of generations of human beings in their maturation toward the more self-fulfilling end of this dimension; originality , adaptlong system

14. From the need for certainty toward tolerance for ambiguity. The basic insecurity of the childs world imposes provide us with an increasing sense of security and self-confdence will we be able to move in the direction of a mature tolerance for annbiguity\_a prerequisite for survival in a world of ambiguity. deep haviors of children have been controlled through systems of reward and punishment with emphasis on the latter. Too often the consequence of this policy is reactions of quires self-understanding and self-control of one's impulses.

A few implications of this multidimensional of maturation can be suggested to illustrate this theory point:

maturing process that ought to be added or that ought to replace some of these dimensions, and certainly, until further research is done on this important aspect of human development we shall have to regard any such formulation as highly tentative. Meantime; the general notion that one of the missions of the adult educator is to assist individuals to continue process throughout life provides some useful guidelines for the development of sequential, continuous; and integrated program of lifelong learning;

1) educational activity provides an opportunity for growth by each individual in several  dimensions.   For example; although focusing on stimulating growth toward increased enlightenment, a course on world affairs can be planned so as to stimulate growth toward greater independence of thought; broader interests, greater objectivity; and tolerance for ambiguity. Every

2) The dimensions of maturation tend to be interdependent; so that changes ín one dimension have an effect on other dimensions. For example; considerable growth toward  enlightenment might be produced by methods (such as those used in the traditional lecture course) which cause the student to become increasingly dependent on the teacher. Although choice may sometimes have to be made between such values; a truly artistic teacher will try to induce positive growth in all dimensions;

3) All human beings mnove on scale from zero to infinity in each dimension throughout and tend to incorporate learning from a given experience in proportion to its relevance to their stage of development on the scale at that moment. For example, in a group of fifteen adult students; the individuals would be ready to take ffteen different degrees of responsibility for their own learning; and if the learning experience life,

No doubt other ultimate needs could be identifed, but these serve to illustrate the that the adult educator's mission in helping individuals is far more complex and signifcant than it might appear on the surface. Perhaps the classic summary 0f individual needs and that define the adult educators' mission and challenge their art is contained in these words of Eduard Lindeman: point goals have only one pragrnatic must reside in the things for which people strive; the which they set for themselves; their wants, needs; desires; and wishes. Even here our criterion is applicable only to those whose lives are already dedicated to aspirations and amnbitions which to the higher levels of human achievement. Viewed from &amp;e standpoint of adult education; such personalities scem to want among other intelligence, power, self expression; freedom; creativity, appreciation; enjoyment, fellowship. Or, stated in terms ol the Greek ideal, are searchers after the life want to count for something; want their experiences to be vivid and meaningful; want their talents to be utilized; want to know beauty and joy; and want all of these realizations of teir total personalities to be shared in communities of want to improve themnselves; this is their But want also to change Ihe socia] order so thal vilal properly expressed ' guide: meaning goals belong things; they good They they they they they they

## The Needs and Goals of Institutions

Much adult education takes place under the auspices of institutions; and adult educators are employed by institutions.  These institutions, too, have needs and that help to define the adult educator's mission: At least three sets of these needs and goals goals

1 The development of individuals in\_the\_institution's constituencu\_in\_the direction of the institution' s for them\_Most institutions with adults in their constituencies have some sort oFímage of the kind of people want to infuence their members to become. For example, labor unions want their members to understand and support the cause of unionism, appreciate its historical role; participate efectively in the activities of their union; understand their legal rights and obligations, exert infuence on policy, be wise consumers, and enjoy the cultural life of their communities. Religious institutions have various ways of describing their for their members, goals they public goals but they

tend to converge on a conception of 'committed"  members  who believe and live according to the creed propounded by the institution. public schools image for its adult constituents is likely to be flavored by such symbols as 'responsible citizen;" "efficient worker; OF parent' that of a university, by 'intellectual leader' OF 'professional leader that of a trade association; by 'industrial statesman` and so on. Institutional leaders expect adult-educational programs to help to produce these kinds of qualities in their constituents; and evaluate the programs at least partly on the basis of their efectíveness in good they doing

Not infrequently the needs and interests of individuals come into conflict with the needs and interests of their institutions; as when a member develops an independence of thought that contradicts the established doctrine of the institution. In such cases the adult educator may have to make choice as to which mission to serve: helping individuals to grow or helping the institution to survive. Increasingly, however, adult educators are resolving such conflicts between education and indoctrination by the institution as their client and helping its leaders to engage in a process of self-study, as a result of whích the institution's educational are often broadened to provide wider areas of freedom for individual growth. taking goals

Even in institutions whose constituents are primarily children and youth, adult education is perceived as an instrumnent for helping them improve the quality of education of the young: Public schools; for example, are devoting increasing energy to improving the educative quality of the home environments of their children through courses; study groups; and lecture series on child development and home and family for parents; parental counseling, and extracurricular activities for parents and children together. Many voluntary youth agencies; such as the Scouts, Girl Scouts, YMCA and YWCA, Sunday schools; and 4-H clubs, perceive the training of volunteer adult leaders as the critical element in their accomplishing their character-building with youth. living Boy goals

- A growing number of institutions especially in industry and government~have come to recognize that one of the most efficient means for increasing the efectiveness of their operation is the continuing education of their employees. This recognition has reached such in industry, in fact, as to move two serious students of the phenomenon to describe the educational activities of American industry as third great educational force on a par with our school and higher-education systems. point public

One of the missions of adult educators, then, is to help institutions become in-

What industry has discovered is equally applicable to every other institution namely, that adult-education processes are basic tools of organizational growth and development.  These processes are now used routinely for the orientation of new employees, for on-the-job training in technical skills; for the preparation of personnel for advancement; for executive development; for supervisory training for the improvement of interpersonal relations within the organization; and for the improvement of the institution's relations. Increasingly these same processes are coming to be used for the planning and guiding of long-run institutional change. public

In the case of contributions of adult education was the education of the about   childhood education 8 this potentially invaluable function was largely neglected until the past few the years rising costs were causing school budgets to be scrutinized critically by the various watchdogs of the public treasuries; school superintendents in a number of cities found that  their most effective supporters came from among the adult citizens who had participated in their programns for  adults. But  the Seattle Public  Schools proved in a dramatic experiment in 1957-58 that adult education processes were even more effective in mobilizing support when used directly for this purpose. After a series of setbacks in school-levy elections in the early 1950s, in spite of all-out publicity campaigns; Citizens School Committee in 1957 organized a citywide program of citizen conferences and study groups in which information about the needs and program of the schools was presented and discussed. When the school was presented to the people in March, 1958, it was approved -a result credited largely to the educational approach taken.9 public During years. evening public Levy levy\_ again

The periodical literature of adult education contains other reports of the use of adult-education processes to produce understanding of such diverse institutions as the armed services (exhibits documentary flms, tours) , universities (public lectures; cultural events, citizen advisory councils), the March of Dimes (which preceded nationwide campaign of Salk   vaccination with community-by-community educational   programs) , and the United   States   National (which sponsored nationwide citizen discussion programs). In general, these programs succeeded in producing real public understanding to the extent that they were informative rather  than indoctrinational   and to the extent that meaningful participation in the work of the institution: public guided its they

It is a legitimnate mission of adult educators to use their art to bring about a better understanding of their institutions; but theirs is a mission requíring the highest ethical commitment, for the line of demarcatíon between education and propaganda is a fine one.

## The Needs and Goals of Society

Every society has used adult-education processes to continue the development of the kind of citizens visualized to be required for the maintenance and progress of that For example; the perception in Soviet society is quite different from the perception in Western the perception in urban society is different from that in rural the perception in Jewish society is different in some respects from the perception in Catholic or Protestant societies; the perception in professional society is different from that in industrial society; and so on\_ The challenging fact is that adult educators are the agents of several different societies whose needs are expected to serve simultaneously. And one of the measures of their artistry is the extent to which they are able to understand and serve these differing needs society; society; they

But there are more general needs of American society, perhaps even of world society; that define an even broader mission for the adult educator.

A strong case can be made for the proposition that the greatest danger to the survival of civilization today is not atomic warfare, not environmental pollution; not the population explosion; not the depletion of natural resources, and not any of the other contemporary crises, but the underlying cause of them all\_the accelerating obsolescence of man. The evidence is mounting that man's ability to cope with a changing world is lagging farther and farther behind the changing world The only now seems to be a crash program to retool the present generation of adults with the competencies required to function adequately in a condition of perpetual change. This is the need \_the awesome challenge ~presented to the adult educator by modern society hope deep

## The Changing and Challenglng Role of Adult Educators

As the mission of adult educators has become more complex and more significant the character of their role has been gradually changing The demands on them to prepare more carefully for perforning the role have increased proportionately.

For years it was assumed that the principles and techniques used in the education of children would be equally effective in helping adults learn. People were therefore recruited to direct institutional programs of adult education on the basis of had experience in programs of youth education; teachers of children were recruited as teachers of adults; and it was taken for granted that any reasonably well-educated person would know how to do a job as program chairman OI study-group leader of a voluntary organization. many having directing good

But as knowledge accumnulated both from experience and from research in adult education and related social sciences; it became increasingly apparent that adults were more than just grown-up children, that possessed certain unique characteristics as leamners that required different principles and techniques from those employed with children. And with this new knowledge, which the rest of this book is concerned with describing; came the insight that adult educators don't just happen; become by learning these principles and techniques. As a result, the role of adult educator has moved gradually away from that of amateur toward that of trained special ist; and opportunities have multiplied for the requisite to be obtained at all leaders and teachers; through short-term institutes and literature; for program directors; through summer workshops; courses; and literature; and for professional leaders; through master's and doctora] programns in graduate schools of education they good they good willing training line

Another way in which the role of adult educators has changing is in its basic theoretical conception. been

As agents of their   responsibilities now extend far beyond the routine ities entail, rather , the involvement of clients in a penetrating analysis of higher aspirations and the changes required to achieve them; the diagnosis of obstacles that mnust be overcome in achieving these and the planning of an efective strategy for answers to the questions think are important than that the clients know Their ultimate objective is to change changes, They they

Initially; adult educators were conceived loosely as 'those who educate adults,' in the sense of transmitting knowledge to thern; them what ought to know\_ OF at best them to learn. Their clientele was perceived as consisting mostly of underprivileged adults; and their function was perceived as primarily remedíal helping individuals catch up to the average. In recent years, however, adult educators are referred to increasingly in the literature as agents' and 25 performing "helping\_roles Their clientele is perceived as consisting of ali types of individuals (indeed) it is the better-educated persons who predominate in adult-education enrollments),  institutions;   and communities.

## What Is Andragogy?

## In the Beginning Was Pedagogy

Until recently there was only one model of assumptions about and the characterístics of learners on which educators could base their curricula and teaching practices.  It evolved in the monastic schools of Europe between the seventh and twelfth centuries and came to dominate secular schools when were organized in the twelfth century and universities when began energing, frst in Bologna and Paris; toward the close of the twelfth century. words (meaning 'child") and agogus (mneaning "leading") So "pedagogy' means, literally; the at and science of teaching children learning they they paid

When adult education began to be organized systematically during the 1920s, teachers of adults began experiencing several problems with the pedagogical model:

The pedagogica] assumptions about learning and learners were; therefore, based initially on observations by the monks in young children relatively simple skills\_originally mostly and With the of elementary schools throughout Europe and North America -and much of the rest of the world, especially by missionaries in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries this model was adopted and reinforced learning around the turn of the twentieth century further contributed to the enthronement of the pedagogical model by limiting their research mostly to the reactions of children and animals to didactic didn't get much knowledge about (in contrast to reactions to teaching) until studies on adult learning to appear after World War II teaching very spread reading writing they leaming began

One problem was that pedagogy was premised on a conception of the purpose of education namely, the transmittal of knowledge and skills that had stood the test of timne~that adult leamners seemed to sense was insufficient. Accordingly, their teachers found them to be resistant frequently to the strategies that pedagogy prescribed, including fact-laden lectures; assigned readings; drill, quizzes; rote memorizing; and examinations.  Adults appeared to want something more than this, and drop-out rates were high.

Although the teachers were not aware of it; one of the great philosophers of this was wrong In an obscure footnote he pointed out that it was appropriate to define education as process of transmittal of what is known only when the time-span of major cultural change was their youth emphasized, "We are in the first period in human history for which this assumption is false today this time-span is considerably shorter than that of human life; and accordingly our training must prepare individuals to face a novelty of conditions "1 An attempt is made in Exhibit 3 to portray Whitehead's concept graphically. living

Note that up to the early part of the twentieth century the time-span of major cultural change massive inputs of new knowledge; technological innovation; vocationa] displacement; population mobility; change in political and economic systems; tural revolutions have already occurred and the pace is accelerating:  Under this new condition; knowledge at any point of time is largely obsolete within a matter of years; and skills that made people productive in their twenties become out-of-date in their thirties. So it is no what is known; i must now be defined as a process of continuing inquiry -is to learn; the skills of self-directed (eg gained ting Tffelong how

Another problem the teachers of adults experienced with the pedagogical model was that many of the assumptions about the characteristics of learners did not seem to ft their adult students. And so experimenting with different assumptions and found out that often produced better results. they began they

## Then Came Andragogy

Between 1929 and 1948 the Joumal of Adult Education published by the American Association for Adult Education; carried articles by successful teachers of adults? describing ways in which were treating adults that deviated from the pedagogical model. Frequently the authors of these articles expressed a sense of for violating academic standards (such as substituting interviews for quizzes)  Obviously, were guilty because had no theory to support their practices; were simply pragmatic and following their intuitions. guilt they feeling they they being

During the 1950s there appearing books which analyzed these teachers" reports and extracted principles that were common to them\_my first book, Informal began

Adult Education; published in 1950, was just such a listing of principles; but it made no attempt to envelop them in a unifying theory:

Then; in the 1960s, we getting from scientifically designed research that   focused on the   internal   processes of adult The seminal study  that launched this direction of movement was Cyril 0. Houle's The Inquiring Mind lished by the University of Wisconsin Press in 1961. Houle found, through in-depth interviews with twenty-two "continuing learners; that his subjects fell into three subgroups: began findings learning;

The first;, the goal-oriented, are those who use education as a mneans of accomplishbecause find in the circumstances of the learning a meaning which has no necessary connection; and often no connection at all, with the content or the announced purposes of the activity. The third, the leaming-oriented, seek knowledge for its own sake. These are not pure types; the best way to represent them pictorially would be by three circles which their edges. But the central emphasis of each subgroup is clearly discernible ' part they overlap

One of Houle' s students, Allen Tough, extended this line of investigation from his position on the of the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education later in the same decade. Tough's research question was; paraphrased: 'How do adults learn natu -rally\_when are not being taught ' His first findings, reported in two reports; Learning Without a Teacher (1967) and The Adult's Leamning Projects (1971), showed that 1) almost all adults engage in from one to twenty major learning projects each with the average number æround eight; 2) only about 10 percent of the learning projects were associated with there is fairly universal 'natural" process of learning\_adults who undertake to learn somethíng on their own go through a similar sequence of steps; 4) adults almost turn to somebody for help at one or more in this sequence; 5) usually go to "helpers' who have not been trained as teachers; but frequently when go to teachers the teachers interfere with their learning by substituting their own pedagogisequence of steps rather than with the leamers' natural sequence. faculty they being always points they they cal fowing

Early ín this process European adult educators felt the need for a label for this new theoretical model that would enable them to talk about it in parallel with gogy; They coined the label "andragogy;' which is based on the Greek word aner (with the stem andr-) , meaning 'man; not boy' a Yugoslavian adult educator in the mid-sixties and used it in an article in Adult Leadership in 1968. Since that time it has appeared with increasing frequency in the literature around the world, and presumably will be listed in the standard dictionaries before peda long;:

A great deal of other knowledge about adult learning was accumulating the sixties from related   disciplines (especially the new group of life-span developmental psychologists)  gerontology; sociand anthropology both in North America and Europe. By and large, this research-based knowledge supported the intuitions of the earlier teachers; and theorists began the knowledge drawn from both sources into a comprehensive; coherent theory of adult learning during ology;

contrast to pedagogy as the art and science of teaching children. Then an increasing number of teachers in elementary and secondary schools (and a few in colleges) reporting to me that were experimenting with applying the concepts of andragogy and finding that in certain situations were producing learning; So I am at the now of that is simply another model of assumptions about learners to be used alongside the pedagogical model of out the assumptions as to their "ft with particular situations. Furthermore; the models are probably most useful  when seen not as dichotomous but rather as two ends of spectrum; with realistic assumption in a given situation in between the two ends. For example; taking the assumption regarding dependency versus self-directedness; six-year-old may be highly self-directing in the rules of game but quite dependent in learning to use a calculator; on the other hand; a forty-year-old may be very dependent in learning to program computer but completely self-directing in learning to repai a piece of furniture. As I see it; whenever a pedagogical assumption is the realistic one, then pedagogical strategies are appropriate; regardless of the age of the learner\_and vice versa. But I would like to make one caveat: an ideological pedagogue-one who has 9 loyalty and commitment to the pedagogical model\_ may be tempted to underrate the extent to which an andragogical assumption may be realistic and may, for example, want to learner dependent long after the learner has become able to be selfdirecting: began they youth they superior point seeing andragogy testing falling learning deep keep

## Some Implications of the Assumptions for Practlce

I would like to explore these assumptions a little more fully and suggest some of their implications for educational practice.

## Self-Concepts and Teachers' Concepts ot Learners

Children enter this world in a condition of complete dependency. Their needs; except for purely biological functions; must be taken care of by someone else. The first image children get of themselves as separate entities is that of dependent personalities whose lives are managed for them by the adult world. church, in the community, and in school, expect the will of adults to be imposed on them. That is what life is like when you are kid. they

As children's self-identities begin to take shape; begin to see themselves a5 having the capacity to start decisions for themselves; at frst experimentally and in small matters that do not impinge on the adult world: mature, children's self-concepts move in the direction of ter self-direction; and adolescence their need to take significant responsibility for managing their own lives becomes s0 strong that it often puts them in open rebellion against control by the adult world:. The tragedy is that in our culture the adult world tends to hold onto its concept of the child as a dependent personality unti] the possible moment. they making greal during last

This self-concept of dependency ís encouraged and reinforced by the adult world; In fact, defines society the appropriate role of children as that of learners; this is their source of their rewards   and self-fulfillment. And on the whole; this role is defined as the more or less passive one of receiving and up the information adults have decided children should have. storing

Although this cultural lag between children's capacity to take responsibility and the freedom the adult world allows them to take responsibility applies to almost all aspects of their lives; it is especially evident in regard to their education: Interestingly, in the kindergarten and early primary our teachers typically involve students in planning and conducting learning activities to considerable degree; But as children move up the educationa] ladder; encounter more and more of the responsibility for thei learning being taken by the teachers; the curriculum planner, and their parents. The net efect is to freeze them into self-concepts of dependency. years they

But something dramatic happens to their self-concepts when people define themselves as adults. They begin to see their normal role in life no longer as being full-timne learners. see themselves increasingly as producers or doers: Their chief sources of self-fulfillment are now their performances as workers, spouses; parents; and citizens. Adults acquire &amp; new status, in their own eyes and in the eyes of others, from these noneducational responsibilities. Their self-concept becomes that of a self-directing\_ sonality. They They

consequences, lo manage their own lives. In fact; the psychological definition of adulthood is the at which individuals perceive themselves to be essentially self-direct And at this people also develop 8 psychological need to be seen by others as being self-directing; point deep point deeply conditioned by their previous schooling (under the pedagogical model) to per ceive the appropriate role of learner to be that of a dependent; more or less passive recipient of transmitted content; that even though may be completely self-direct in all other aspects of their lives; the minute enter into any activity labeled "education,' sit back, fold their arms, and say; Teach me The problem arises when teachers take this stance at face value and start treating adult learners as if were dependent personalities; for this induces an inner conflict within the adults between thís preconditioned intellectual model of the role of learner and the adults' psychological need to be self-directing: Hence there is the need to build into our program designs some preparatory experiences that will help adults get a new way of thinking about the role of learner and some new skills in self-directed learning 5 they ing they they deep

Fortunately, once adults make the discovery that can take responsibility for their own learning, as do for other facets of their lives; experience a sense of release and exhilaration then enter into with ego-involvement with results that are frequently startling both to themselves and to their teachers. Teachers who have helped their adult students to achieve this breakthrough report repeatedly that it is one of the most rewarding experiences of their lives. they they they \_ learning deep They

Often there is another ingredient in the self-concept of adults that affects their role as learners. They may carry over from their previous experience with schooling the perception that are not smart, at least in to academic work. This fact about the adult has several consequences for adult education. In the case of some adults the remembrance of the classroom as a place where one is treated witb disrespect and may fail is so strong that it serves as a serious barrier to their becoming involved in adult-education activities at all. This barrier can be reduced by interpreting adult learning activities as diferent and enjoyable and perhaps by having the meetings in nonacademic locations. In the case of other adults; simply providing them with some early success experiences that will help them build positive self-concepts as learners will be sufficient. regard they very psyche being

## Impllcations tor Practice

Several implications for practice fow from this difference in assumptions about learners.

1 The leaming climate: The self-concept of an adult has several consequences regarding the requirements of an environment that will be conducive to adult learning It suggests that the physical environment should be one in which adults feel at ease. Furnishings and equipment should be adult-sized and comfortable; rooms should be arranged informally and should be decorated according to adult tastes; and acoustics and lighting should take into account declining audiovisual acuity. being meeting

Even more imnportandy, the psychological climate should be one which causes adults to feel accepted, respected and supported; in which there exists a spirit of mutuality between teachers and students as joint inquirers; in which there is freedom of expression without fear of punishment or ridicule. People tend to feel more adult" in an atmosphere that is friendly and informal; in which are known by name and valued as unique individuals;\_than in the traditional school atmnosphere of formality, semianonymnity, and status differentiation between teacher and student they

The behavior of the teacher probably influences the character of the climate more than any other single factor, however. Teachers convey in many ways whether their attitude is one of interest in and respect for the students or whether see the students essentially as receiving sets for transmissions of wisdom. Teachers who take the time and trouble to get to know their students individually and who call them by name (especially by first namne) obviously convey the first set of attitudes.  But probably the behavior that most explicitly demonstrates that teacher really cares about students and respects their contributions is the act of really listening to what the students say. learning they

In andragogical  practice, care is taken to determine what are the symnbols of chíldishness to particular groups of adults; and to remove them. For some\_particu-larly undereducated adultsit is a school in which case social-agency facilirooms would probably be environments more conducive to leaming; For others a on stage makes them feel that are talked down to, in which case a table on the Boor would a more appropriate work space for the teacher adults associate rooms in which chairs are placed in rows with childhood regimentation and passivity and find conducive to adult-type relationships. A few adults report that chalkboards are a symbol of childishness to them; which may help to explain the growing popularity in adult education of newsprint-pads on easels. building Living podium being they small provide Many

The notion of a climate of adultness can be extended beyond individual classrooms and applied to total institutions: Indeed, such a climate is likely to be established in classrooms if it pervades the whole institution and is reflected in its architecture, One can sense rather quickly on an institution; for examnple; whether it cares more about people or whether it is concerned about the feelings and welfare of individuals or herds them through cattle; and whether it views adults as dependent personalities or self-directing human entering things; like beings.

- 2. Diagnosis of needs. The adult's self-concept of self-directivity is in direct conflict with the traditional practice of the teacher the students what need to learn Indeed it is even in confict with the social philosophy that society has a right to imposo its ideas about what need to learn on them. Of course; adults will learn what others want them to leamn ú their power to themn for not learning is are more deeply motivated to learn those see the need to learn. telling they they punish strong things they

In therefore, emphasis is placed on the involvement of adult learners in a model of the competencies or characteristics required to achieve a given ideal model of performance; so that the learner has some vision of the supervisor, the speaker, the   'good' parent; and the like-~and of the competencies andragogy great 'good" 'good" public

required to become It is in this model-building phase that the values and expectations of the teacher; the institution; and society are amalgamated with those of learners can assess their 'present level of competencies in the light of those portrayed in the model; this is an underdeveloped area of andragogical technology; but one in which there is currently a ferment of invention. Such techniques as critical incident processes; sociodrama computerized games; laboratory methods; and simulation exercises are developed to enable learners to perform and then to get feedback that helps them in objectively assessing the strengths and weaknesses of their performance; 3) helping the leamers to measure the gaps between their present competencies and those required by the model, so that experience a feeling of dissatisfaction about the distance between where are and where would like to be, and so are able to identify specific directions of desirable growth. This experiencing of self-induced dissatisfaction wíth present inadequacies, coupled with a clear sense of direction for self-improvement is in fact a definition of 'motivation to learn. 'good:' being they they good nature that goes like this: human tend to feel committed to a decision (or an activity) to the extent that have participated in ít (or planning it) Teachers of adults who do all the planning for their students, who come into the classroom and impose preplanned activities on thexn; typically experience apathy, resentmnent; and probably withdrawal. This imposition of the will of the teacher is incongruent with the adults self-concept of self-directivity. beings they making

The function of planning;   with which the remainder of this book is largely concerned, consists of translating diagnosed needs into educational objectives (or directions of growth), designing and conducting learning experiences to achieve these objectives; and evaluating the extent to which these objectives have been accomplished: In andragogy, responsibility for performing this function is a mutual one between the learners and the teacher\_ specific

Accordingly, basic element in the technology of andragogy is the involvement of the learners in the process of planning their own learning; with the teacher serving as a procedural and content resource. When the number of students is small enough, can al be involved in the planning directly; when the number gets much over thirty, adult educators make use of representative councils;   committees;   task forces, teams; or other devices through which the learners feel that are participating in the planning by proxy. guide they they

4. Conducting leaming experiences: In traditional pedagogical practice (and in contemporary programmed instruction) the function of the teacher is defined as 'to teach.' The teacher is expected to take full responsibility for what happens in the teachingtransaction: The learner's role tends to be that of a fairly passive recipient of the teacher's instruction. learning

In contrast, in congruence with the adult's self -concept of self-directivity; andragogical practice treats the learning-teaching transaction as the mnutual responsibility of learners and teacher. In fact, the teachers role is redefined as that of a procedural technician, resource person, and coinquirer; more a catalyst than an instructor, more a than a wizard. assumnes that teacher cannot really 'teach in the sense of 'make a person learn;= but that one person can only help another person compulsion to teach my students something I know ought to know but that do not yet know ought to guide Andragogy, they they they know, which I sometimes do because bad habits take time to break, report that it in the way of their My practice has improved since I adopted the policy sense this happening;) learning; gets they

- 5. Evaluation of Probably\_the crowning instance of incongruity between traditional educational practice and the adult's self-concept of self-directivity is the act of a teacher giving a to a student. makes an adult feel more childlike thap judged by another adult; it is the ultimate sign of disrespect and depenas the one who is being judged experiences it. leaming grade Nothing being

Later chapters describe procedures by which learners can responsibly share in responsibility for their own learning; Suffce it to say at this that an andraresponsibility for belping one another learn. taking point training learning sharing

For this reason, andragogical prescribes a process of self-evaluation; in which the teacher devotes energy to helping the adults get evidence for themselves about the progress are toward their educational In this process; the strengths and weaknesses of the educationa] program itself must be assessed in terms of how it has facilitated or inhibited the learning of the students. So evaluation is a mutual undertaking as are al other phases of the adult experience. theory they making goals. learning

This shift from evaluation to self-evaluation or rediagnosis places a heavy burden on teachers of adults; They must set the example of being open to feedback regarding their performance. must be skillful in establishing a supportive climate in which hard-to-accept information about one's performance can be looked at objectively. And must be creative about inventing ways in which students can get comprehensive data about their own performance. Some of the techniques available in carrying this burden are explored in later chapters They they

In fact; what is happening in practice is that precisely the same procedures that are used for the diagnosis of learning needs are employed to help the learners measure in competence; For instance, by comnparing their performance in a critical incident at the end of a similar critical incident at the beginning of the experience, learners can precisely measure the changes produced by the experience; Because of the similarity of these two processes, 1 find now less and less in terms of the evaluation of rediagnosis of needs. And I fnd that; when my adult students perceive what do at the end of a learning experience as rediagnosing rather than evaluating; enter into the activity with more enthusi asm and see it as launches them into a new of learning reinforcing the notion that learning is continuing process. being gains solving learning quite myself thinking learning they cycle

My own is that the single most critical diference between children and and this is why these assumptions and their technological implications have been dealt with in such detail. But there are other important diferences. feeling

## The Role of Experience

Adults enter into any undertaking with a different background of experience from that of their youth lived longer, have accumulated a greater colume of Having they

experience. But have also had different kinds of experience. Children have not had the experience of making their own living, marrying having children; real community responsibility, or responsible for the welfare of others (although have observed all these things in their families and on televisionl);\_ they taking they being

But adults derive their self-indentity from their experience. define who are in terms of the accumulation of their unique sets of experience. S0 if you ask adults who are, are likely to identify themselves by describing what their occupations are, where have worked, where have traveled; what their training and experience have equipped them to do; and what their achievements have been. Adults are what have done. they They they they they they they

There i5, ít seems to me, another subtle difference between children and adults as their experience. To children; experience is something that happens to them; it is an external event that affects them; not an integral part of them: If you ask children who are; are likely to identify themselves in terms of who their parents are, who their older brothers and sisters are, where live; and what school attend. Their self-identity is largely derived from external sources. regards they they they they

Because adults define themselves largely by their experience, have a investment in its value. And so when find themselves in situations in which their experience is not used, or its worth is minimized, it is not just their experience that is rejected feel rejected as persons. deep they they being being they

These differences in experience between children and adults have at least three for learning; 1) adults have more to contribute to the leaming of others; consequences for most kinds of learning are themselves a rich resource for learníng; 2) adults have richer foundation of experience to which to relate new experiences (and new leamnings tend to take on meaning as we are able to relate them to our experience); 3) adults have acquired a larger number of fxed habits and patterns of thought and therefore tend to be less open-minded. they past

## Implicallons tor Practice

1. Emphasis 0n experiential techniques. Because adults are themselves richer resources for learning than is true of children; greater can be placed on techniques that the experience of the adult learners, such as group discussion; the case method, the projects; action projects, laboratory methods; consultative supervision demonstration seminars; work conferences; counseling; group therapy, and community development There ís a distinct shift in in andragogy away from the transmittal techniques prevalent in edacation\_the lecture; assigned readings; and canned audiovisual   presentation ~toward the more 'participation' and 'ego-involvement' are boldfaced words in the lexicon of the adult educator, with the assumption often being made that the more active the learner's role in the process, the more are probably learning: emphasis emphasis youth they

Several implications for practice flow from these differences in experience.

2. Emphasis on practical application Skillful adult educators have always taken care to see that new concepts or broad generalizations were illustrated by life experiences drawn from the learners. But numerous recent studies on the transfer of learning and the maintenance of behavioral change indicate the desirability of going even further, and actually building into the design of learning experiences provision for the learners to plan ~and even rehearse~how are going to apply their learnings to their to-day lives. daythey

3. Unfreezing and leaming to leam from erperience: A growing andragogical practice is to build into the early phases of a course, workshop; conference; institute, or other sequential educational activity an 'unfreezing' experience, in which the adults are helped to be able to look at themselves more objectively and free their minds from preconceptions: of the diagnostic procedures and structured exercises described in Chapter 1l help to serve this purpose.

## Readiness to Learn

Itis well accepted in our culture now that children learn best those that are necessary for them to know in order to advance from one phase of development to the next. These have been dubbed "developmental tasks by developmental psychologists: things

A the individual, successful achievement of which leads to his happiness and to success

Each of these developmental tasks produces a 'readiness to learn which at its presents a "teachable moment. For example, parents now generally accept the fact that cannot teach children to walk until they have mastered the art of crawling their leg muscles are strong enough; and have become frustrated at not able to stand up and walk the way everybody else does. At that point; and only then, are able to learn to walk; for it has become their developmental task peak they being they

For example; in a person's role of worker, the first developmental task is to get a job. At that point individuals are ready to learn anything required to get a job, but defnitely are not ready to study supervision: landed a job, are faced with the task of mastering it so that will not get fired from it; and at that are ready to leamn the special skills it requires; the standards that are expected, and how to get with fellow workers. Having become secure in a basic job; the next task becomes one of up the occupational ladder. Now to become a supervisor or executive. Finally, after reaching their face the task of dissolving the role of worker and to learn about retirement or substitutes for work. they Having point they along working they ceiling they

Recent research suggests that the same phenomenon is at work during the adult of growth and resulting developmental  tasks; readinesses to learn; and teachable moments. But whereas the developmental tasks of youth tend to be the products primarily of physiological and mental maturation, those of the adult years are the products primarily of the evolution of social roles. Robert J Havighurst; one of the pioneers in this area of research, divides the adult years into three phases\_ "early adulthood; "middle age,~ and "later maturity and identifies ten social roles of adulthood: worker, mate; parent homemaker; son or daughter of aging parents; citizen; friend, organization member, religious affiliate, and user of leisure time. The requirements for performing each of these social roles according to Havighurst; as we move through the three phases of adult life, thereby up changing developmental tasks and; therefore, changing readiness to learn. phases years . change, setting

Havighurst illustrates the changes in developmental tasks during the three periods of adult life as follows:

- -Selecting a mate
- ~Starting family
- ~Learning to live with a marriage partner
- ~Rearing children
- started in an occupalion ~Getting
- ~Managing a home
- Taking on civic responsibility
- ~Finding congenial social group

## Middle Age (ages 30 to 55);

- ~Establishing and maintaining an economic standard of living
- ~Achieving adult civic and social responsibility
- ~Assisting teenage children to become responsible and adults
- ~Developing adult leisure-time acuvities
- ~Accepting and adjusting to the physiological changes of middle age
- ~Adjusting to aging parents

Later Maturity (ages 55 and over);

- ~Adjusting to retirement and reduced income
- ~Adjusting to decreasing physical strength and health
- ~Adjusting to te death of a spouse
- ~Meeting socia] and civic obligations
- Establishing an explicit affiliation with one's age group
- ~Establishing satisfactory physical arrangements? living

As Havighurst concludes, 'People do not launch themselves into adulthood with the momentum of their childhood and youth and simply coast to old age. Adulthood has its transition points and its crises. It is a developmental period in almost as complete a sense as childhood and adolescence ae developmental periods," along

Since Havighurst's foundational work on developmental tasks; &amp; number of other investigations of the life stages; transitions; passages; crises, and transformations of the adult years have been published; are listed in the suggested readings at the end of this chapter. in Appendix C. The chief value of these lists for the adult-educational practitioner is to stimulate ideas as to what adults at different stages of development are ready to learn. But one word of caution about them: most of the are based on studies of middleclass Americans. they Lists

## Impllcatlons lor Practlce

At least two sets of implications for practice fow from this difference in readiness to learn:

1 The timing of leamings: If the teachable moment for particular adults to acquire a given learning is to be captured, it is obvious that the sequence of the curriculum must be timed so as to be in with their developmental tasks. This is the appropriate step

organizing principle for an adult-education program, rather than the logic of the subject matter Or an orientation program for not start with the and philosophy of the corporation; but rather with real-life concerns of new workers: Where will I be working? With whom will I be working? What will be expected of me? How do people company? What is the time schedule? To whom can I go for help? history

There have been some classic examples of the consequences of this organizing principle   One was the introduction of courses on supervision in trade schools; nursing schools, and other preservice vocational prograrns after World War II, when there was a great shortage of experienced supervisors  The courses were plagued with absenteeism, funk-outs; and drop-outs~simply because it was not yet a mental task of people who have not become secure about a job themselves to learn how to supervise others in the job. Other examples of failure of programs resulting from violation of the readiness-to-learn principle are the several attempts by corporations and at least one national social agency to institute programs on prepara tion for retirement that are geared to people in their forties. Almost universally these programs have resulted in low enrollment; for the simple reason that people whose eyes are still set on going up the occupational ladder are not ready to invest energy in studying how to get of the ladder. violating developdoing doing

2. The grouping of learners. The concept of developmental tasks provides some ance regarding the grouping of learners. For some kinds of learnings homogeneous groups according to developmental task are more efective. For instance; in a program on child care, young parents would have different set of interests  from the parents of adolescent children; For other kinds of learnings; heterogeneous groups would clearly be preferable: For instance; in a program of human-relations in which the objective is to help people leamn to get better with all kinds of people; perhaps other characteristics that make people diferent. In my own practice, I have adopted the policy of making provision in the design of any adult-learning activity for a variety of subgroups s0 as to give the students a flexibility of choice; and I find that they quickly discover colleagues with similar developmental tasks. guid quite training along

## Orientation to Learning

with a different   time  perspective  from children, which in turn produces a difference in the way view learning; Children tend to have a perspective of postponed application on most of their learning; For example; most of what I learned in elementary school I learned in order to be able to get into high school; and most of what I learned there I learned to prepare me for and most of what I learned in hoped would prepare me for a and productive adult life. To a child, education is essentially process of the accumulation of reservoir of subject matter-knowledge and skills\_that might be useful later in life. Children tend, therefore, to enter any educational activity in a subject-centered frame of mind. they college; college happy

Adults; on the other hand, tend to have a perspective of immediacy of application toward most of their ing their to cope with life problems face now. tend, therefore, to enter an educational activity in problem-centered or performance-centered frame of mind they ability they They

## Impllcatlons tor Practlce

Several implications for practice Bow from this difference in orientation to learning;

1. The orientation of adult educators. Just as adults a different orientation to learning from that of children; so it would seem to follow that different orientation toward is required on the part of educators of adults from the orientation traditionally inculcated in educators of children: Where educators can; perhaps appropriately, be primarily concemed with the logical development of subject matter and its articulation from to according to levels of complexity; adult educators must be primarily attuned to the existential concerns of the individuals and institutions serve and be able to develop experiences that will be articulated with these concerns. have leaming youth grade grade learning ' they lum of education was the seven subjects\_the trivium (grammar, rhetoric, and logic) and quadrivium (arithmetic, music;, geometry; and astronomy) of the medieval schools. Although the number of subjects has proliferated since the Middle Ages; the with the emergence of the insights of andragogy the curriculum\_which, incidentally, in adult education is increasingly  referred to as 'program ~of adult education is coming to look less and less like the curriculum of education. youth youth

Because adult learners tend to be problem-centered in their orientation to learnthe appropriate organizing principle for sequences of adult is problem areas, not subiects. For example; instead of ofering courses on Composition 1" and "Composition IL,;' with the first focusing on grammar and the second on writing andragogical practice would in their place "Writing Better Business Letters' and Short Stories. In the adult courses; matters of grammar and style would be treated in the context of the practical concerns of the learners. Even the broad curricular categories used to describe what adults study have departed from the tradition al categories of the academic disciplines. In the Handbook for Adult Education for example, such labels were given to the 'Program Areas" as 'Education for Family Life, 'Education for Social and Public Responsibility' and then "Education for SelfFulflment.

3. The design of leamning experiences: The problem-orientation of the leamers implies that the most appropriate starting for every learning experience is the problems and concerns that the adults have on their minds as enter. Whereas the opening session of a youth-education activity might be titled "What This Course Is All About, in an adult-educational activity it would more appropriately be titled "What Are You Hoping lo Get Out of This Course?" Early in the session there would be problem census specific problems want to be able to deal with more adequately. This is not to suggest that a adult-learning experience ends with the problems the learners are aware of in the beginning, but that is where it starts. There may be other problems that the teacher or institution expects to be dealt with; and these are put into the picture with the students' problems for negotiation between teacher and students. point they they good along

## Some Other Assumptlons about Learnlng and Teaching

when teacher comes face-to-face with a group of learners. As I see it; the andragogical approach to the learning-teaching transaction is premised on three additional as sumptions about and teaching: learning

1 Adults can leam The central proposition on which the entire adult-education movement is based is that adults can learn. One of the moments in the of the movement occurred at the annual meeting of the Amnerican  Association for Adult Education held in Cleveland in 1927, when Edward L. Thorndike reported for the frst time his that the ability to learn declined only very slowly and slightly after age twenty. Until that moment adult educators had based their whole work on blind faith, in direct opposition to the prevailing belief that 'you can't teach an old dog new tricks But now tbeir faith had been vindicated; there was scientific that adults can leam great history findings very proof

Actually, Thorndike' s early studies did seem to indicate a decline in learning capacity of about 1 percent per year after age twenty-five; But later studies; especially those of Thomdike' s colleague Irving revealed  that what declined was the speed of learning; not intellectual power and that even this decline was likely to be minímized by continued use of the intellect. Lorge,

~Adults who have been away from systematic education for some time may underestimate their ability to learn; and this lack of confidence may prevent them from applying themselves wholly.

The research to date of adult learning clearly indicates that the basic to individuals do not actually perform as well in situations as could, the cause must be sought in such as the following: ability learning they factors

Various physiological changes occur in the process of aging, such as decline in visual acuity, reduction in of reaction; and lowering of energy levels;  which operate as barriers to unless compensated for by such devices as louder sound, printing; and slower pace. speed learning larger

Adults respond less readily to external sanctions for learning (such as grades) than to internal motivation.

2. Leaming is tendency to look upon education as the transmittal of information; to see learning as an almost exclusively intellectual process consisting of the storing of accumulated facts in the drawers of the mind. The implicit assumption underlying this view of learning is that it is essentially an external process in the sense that what the student learns is deterined primarily by outside forces; such as the excellence of the teacher's presentation; the quality of reading materials, and the effectiveness of school discipline. People this view even insist that teachers' qualifications be judged by their mastery of subject matter and clamor their wasting time learning about the psychology of learning For all practical purposes this víew defnes the function of the teacher as to teach subject matter, not students. been Gling holding today only against being

A growing body of research into what happens when learning takes place has put this traditional conception of learning ín serious jeopardy. Although there is not theories wbich seem to explain different parts of it) there is agreement that it is an really

internal process controlled by the leamers and engaging their whole being\_including intellectual, emotional, and physiological functions. Learing is described psychologi cally as a process of need-meeting and goal-striving by the learners. This is to say tat individuals are motivated to engage that invest their energy in maldng usc 'of avatlable Tcsources (including teachers and readings) to the cxtent thet perceive them * relevanttotetr Teeds ud goals. being

The important implication for adult-education practice of the fact that learning is an internal process is that tbose methods and techniques which involve the individual most deeply in self-directed inquiry will produce the greatest learning This principle of ego-involvement lies at the heart of the adult educator's art:. In fact; the main thrust of modern adult-educational technology is in the direction of inventing techniques for involving adults in ever-deeper processes of self-diagnosis of theír own needs for continued learning in formulating their own objectives [or learning in sharing responsibilprogress toward their objectives: The truly artistic teachers of adults perceive the locus of responsibility for learning to be in the learer; conscientiously suppress their own compulsion to teach what know students ought to learn in favor of helping students learn for themselves what want to learn. I have described this faith in the ability of individuals to learn for themselves as the 'theological foundation" of adult sibility in the learing-teaching transaction; but only that their responsibility lies less in giving ready-made answers to predetermined questions and more in being ingenious in better ways to help students discover the important questions and the answers for themselves. they they fnding

The central dynamic of the learning process is thus perceived to be the experience of the learners; experience defined as the interaction between individuals and their envionment.  The quality and amount of leamning is therefore clearly infuenced by the quality and amount of interaction between the learners and their environment and by the educative potency of the environment:. The art of teaching is essentially the management of these two variables in the learning process environment  and interaction\_which together define the substance of the basic unit ot leaming "learning experience." The critical function of the teacher, therefore, is to create a rich envionment from which students can extract leamning and then to their interaction with it so as to optimize their learning from it: being key guide

One of the clearest statements of this insight about adult learning was made in 1926 by the great American pioneer adult-education theorist Eduard C. Lindeman;

conceiving adult education ín terms of a new technique for learning &amp; technique as essential to the graduate as to the unlettered manual worker. It represents a process by which the adult learns to become aware of and to evaluate hís experience. To do this he cannot begin by studying "subjects' in the that some this information will be useful. On the contrary; he begins by giving attention to situations in wbich he finds himself, to problems which include obstacles to his self-fulfillment Facts and information from the differentiated spheres of knowledge are used, not for the pupose of accumulation; but because of need in solving problems. In this process the teacher finds a new function. He is no longer the oracle who speaks from the learning in proportion to the vitality and relevancy of his facts and experiences In sbort; my conception of adult education is this: a cooperative venture in ponautboricollege hope ' day tarian; informal learning the chief purpose of which is to discover the meaning of experience; quest of the mind which digs down to the roots of the preconceptions which lormulate our conduct; a technique of leaming for adults which makes education coterminous with life and hence elevates itself to the level of adventurous living

3. There are superior conditions of leaming and principles of It ís becoming increasingly clear from the growing body of knowledge about the processes of adult learning that  there are certain conditions of learning that are more conducive to growth and development than others. These superior conditions seem to be produced by practices in the learning-teaching transaction that adhere to certain superior ples of teaching as identified below: teaching; princi-

## Some Implications tor Youth Educatlon

The differences between children and adults are not so much real differences; I believe; as differences in assumptions about them that are made in traditional see themselves as self-directing in broadening areas of their lives; start accumulating experience that has increasing value for learning; start preparing for social roles (such as through part-time jobs) and therefore experiencing adultlike readinesses to learn; and encounter life problems for which would like some learnings for immediate application: Therefore; many of the principles of andragogy have direct relevance to the education of children and youth. peda they being they they

But these developments are quite piecemeal, and the practitioners have lagged far behind the curriculum theorists in helping students learn how to leamn rather than just teaching them what 'ought" to know; What is required, if education is to produce adults who are capable of engaging in a lifelong of continuing development is a whole new set of assumptions about the purpose of education and a new technology to carry out that purpose. I can foresee that the result would be a more andragogical approach to the education of children and youth; As my contribution toward movement in this direction I amn presenting in Appendix D a scbema 1 prepared for UNESCO, "Toward a Model of Lifelong Education" youth they self process youth

The fact is that many of the new developments in the curricula of our elementary and secondary schools have some of the Havor of andragogy; The "new math;, new and linguistics programs start with the concerns of the students and engage them in a process of largely self-directed discovery; Some of the products of today' s better equipped to continue a biology,

## The Andragogical Process of Program Development

When the principles of andragogy are translated into process for planning and operating educational programs, that process turns out to be different from the curriculum planning and teaching processes traditionally employed in youth education The rest of this book is concerned with describing this proceSS as it to the planning of comprehensive prograrns of adult education 5 applies (Chapters through 1O) and to the management of specific expcriences (Chapter quite learning

As I see it, this andragogical process involves the phases consistently in both levels of application (total programs and individual learning activities); following

- The creation of an organizational structure for participative planning;
- 5) The formulation of directions of learning (objectives);
- 3) The diagnosis of needs for learning;
- The development of a design of activities;
- The rediagnosis of needs for learning (evaluation)
- The operation of the activities; 8)

## How Do We Know That It Is Betler?

Feople frequently ask me what research has been done vis-à-vis the andragogical model that supports the proposition that it is superior to the pedagogical model. My

This kind of question arises from a curious disease that seems to be endemic in the world of learning It might be called panacea-addiction. Philosophers call it either-or It is a theory . thinking;

As I said in an earlier chapter, I have the impression that many traditional teachers (and theorists; for that matter) have an almost ideological attachment to the pedagogical model:. It is something have to be loyal to; enforce with sanctions (like normative grading); and protect from heresy. I don't see as an at all, but a system of assumptions about learners that needs to be tested out for pedagogical model, since it makes legitimate the application of pedagogical strategies leaming they andragogy ideology
