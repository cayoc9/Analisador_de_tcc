## Preface

Self-directed learning is coming of ageÉ.

In recognition  of  the  25 th International Self-Directed  Symposium,  held  in February 2011, this issue begins with some brief comments on the history and impact of these  annual  gatherings  over  the  last  quarter  century  from  the  Editor  and  the  Editor Emeritus  and  an  introduction  to  the  International  Society  for  Self-Directed  Learning, which grew out of the annual symposia and now sponsor them as well as this journal.

Continuing  a  tradition  begun  in  the  first  issue  of  this  journal  to  provide  an international  perspective  that  reflects  cultural  differences  in  the  interpretation  and terminology of self-directed learning, Philippe Carr é and some of his colleagues present an in-depth view of lÕAutoformation , self-directed learning in France.

Then  four  authors  who  presented  invited  papers  at  the  first  International  SelfDirected  Learning  Symposium  in  1986  offer  expansions  or  new  perspectives  on  their topics. Carol Kasworm explored self-directed learning in institutional contexts in her 1986 paper, arguing that Òacts of self-directed learningÓ should be conceptually framed through adult developmental theories, focused upon qualitative cognitive and affective change and growth. To that contention she adds new insights, primarily based on the work of Magolda and Kegan. Paul and Lucy Guglielmino, who focused on self-directed learning in business and industry as an information age imperative in 1986, report on an outgrowth of the cross-cultural examination of self-directed learning in business and industry over the last 30  years:  data  that  indicate  very  strong  associations  between  self-directed  learning readiness,  HofstedeÕs  cultural  dimensions,  and  country  economic  indicators.  Finally, Roger Hiemstra argues that, despite the many years of research and discussion on the benefits of self-directed learning and the approaches that promote its development in the classroom, many educators and trainers still rely on traditional approaches. He reiterates and  expands  on  his  suggestions  to  bring  practice  into  alignment  with  the  SDL approaches that have proven more promising.

## Perspectives: The International Society for Self-Directed Learning and

## The International Self-Directed Learning Symposium

## Lucy Madsen Guglielmino and Huey B. Long

On  the  25 th anniversary  of  the  first  International  Self-Directed  Learning Symposium (ISDLS), the authors describe the International Society for SelfDirected Learning (ISSDL), an organization that grew out of the Symposium  and  now  sponsors  it;  and  detail  the  history  and  some  of  the contributions  of  the  Symposia.  They  also  note  the  Malcolm  Knowles Memorial  Award  given  by  the  ISSDL,  which  recognizes  individuals  who have  made  significant  lifelong  contributions  to  the  field  of  self-directed learning.

Self-direction in learning is coming of of age; it is now recognized as a dynamic combination of attitudes and skills, essential for dealing with the complexity individuals face in all aspects of their lives. In educational institutions at all levels, the development of  skills  and  attitudes  supportive  of  self-direction  in  learning  is  now  often  an  integral part of mission and goals statements. Accreditation standards of medical programs and engineering  programs  incorporate  a  requirement  for  evidence  of  preparation  of  future doctors, nurses, engineers, pharmacists, and physical therapists, among others, for future lifelong, self-directed learning (For example, National Academy of Engineering, 2004; Simon &amp; Aschenbrener, 2005).  In business and industry human resource development, there is increasing recognition that, in a highly competitive global economy, employees can no longer be taught everything they need to learn in order to help their organizations remain  relevant  and  productive  (Friedman,  2005).  Instead,  each  individual  in  the organization must be constantly alert to opportunities to improve products, systems, or services; and they must be capable of learning what they need to know in order to do that.  There can no longer be a few visionaries assessing the needs of organizations and passing the needs along to trainers who design programs.  Change is happening too fast. Senge's (2006) call for the learning organization is now clearly heard by all, if not yet perfectly  understood.    In  addition,  as  Pink  (2009)  so  eloquently  documented,  the  old training  approach,  normally  based  on  a  'carrots  and  sticks'  mentality,  has  been demonstrated  in  research  to  actually  reduce  motivation  for  task  completion  and  for learning in many situations (p. 35).

Our world is vastly different now from the world we lived in 25 years ago. The few who were calling insistently for more attention to preparing both children and adults for self-direction in learning are finally being heard, and the echoes are global-but the work  is  not  done.  Many  questions  still  exist,  and  many  who  are  in  positions  where facilitation  of  learning  should  be  the  norm  continue  to  fall  back  on  the  stale  and motivation-sapping lecture-and-test syndrome. We are in the middle of a paradigm shift in  institutional  and  organizational  approaches  to  learning,  and  paradigm  shifts  require time, trial and error, research and application, and constant adaptation and re-invention. The  period  of  change  is  inevitably  marked  by  enthusiasm,  innovation,  and  creative response by some; and by resistance, false starts, and disjunction of espoused theories and theories of use by others.  The need for research and information dissemination on self-direction in learning continues to be a vital one.

On the occasion of the 25 th International Self-Directed Learning Symposium, it seems  appropriate  to  document  the  inception  of  the  International  Society  for  SelfDirected Learning (ISSDL), which now sponsors the symposia and this journal, and to reflect on the contributions of the annual symposia over the past quarter-century.

## The International Society for Self-Directed Learning (ISSDL)

The  International  Society  for  Self-Directed  Learning  exists  because  of  the continued  need  for  dedicated  research  in  the  critical  area  of  self-directed  learning. Founded in 2006 by a group of researchers attending the 20 th International Self-Directed Learning  Symposium,  the  ISSDL  formed  as  a  Florida  nonprofit  corporation  in  2007, with the papers being filed as of January 1, 2008.

We are dedicated to

- ¥  the promotion of self-directed, lifelong learning and
- ¥  the  encouragement  and  dissemination  of  continued  research  on  selfdirected learning both within and outside of institutional contexts (ISSDL, 2011, p.1).

Those contexts include childhood education, higher education, adult education, training and human resource development, as well as informal and non-formal learning settings. The ISSDL offers two major venues for information exchange and research dissemination:

## The International Self-Directed Learning Symposium

Founded  by  Dr.  Huey  Long  in  1986,  the  Symposium  provides  an  annual international forum for the presentation and discussion of current developments in the study and application of self-directed learning.

## The International Journal of Self-Directed Learning

Published  biannually  since  2004,  the IJSDL is  a  refereed,  electronic  journal founded  to  disseminate  scholarly  papers  that  document  research,  theory,  or innovative  or  exemplary  practice  in  self-directed  learning.  Founding  co-editors were Lucy M. Guglielmino and Huey B. Long.

The  ISSDL  maintains  a  website  to  disseminate  the  journal  and  to  provide information  about  the  Symposium.  For  information  on  paper  submission  for  the symposium  or  article  submission  for  the  journal,  go  to  www.sdlglobal.com.    Both Maurice Gibbons (2011) and Roger Hiemstra (2011) maintain links to www.sdlglobal.com on their excellent and very active SDL websites.

The  ISSDL  also  presents  the Malcolm S.  Knowles  Memorial  Award to  honor Knowles for his pioneering contributions to the study and practice of self-direction in learning and to recognize others who have made significant lifelong contributions to the field  of  self-directed  learning.  Further  information  about  each  of  these  three  functions follows.

## Contributions of the Symposium

For  25  years,  a  group  of  researchers  have  been  devoted  to  exploring  the phenomenon  of  self-direction  in  learning  at  the  International  Self-Directed  Learning Symposia.    In  1986,  approximately  20  years  had  passed  since  Houle's  (1961)  and Tough's (1967) seminal research, closely followed by some major studies in the 1970's (for  example,  Brookfield,  1978;  Gibbons  et  al.,  1980;  Guglielmino,  1978;  Hiemstra, 1976; Long, 1975).  Noting the proliferation of research in this area, Huey Long invited a  small  group  of  individuals  who  had  been  involved  in  research  and  writing  on  selfdirection in learning to share and discuss their work.  Nine presentations were given by 14  researchers  to  an  audience  that  included  25  other  scholars  and  students  of  selfdirected learning (Long &amp; Associates, 1988, p. x). Setting a pattern that continues to this day,  each  presentation  was  followed  by  an  opportunity  for  the  listeners  to  question, critique, and suggest refinements.

At  the  symposia,  the  research  is  rigorous,  but  the  atmosphere  is  informal.  In keeping with the concept of fostering self-direction in learning, we strive to develop a true learning community. The rigor: All proposals are refereed, and those accepted for paper presentations are required to submit their papers a month before the symposium. Each paper presenter is assigned a reactor, who receives the paper in advance and leads the discussion after the paper is presented. The atmosphere:  Collegial discussions and constructive feedback are the norm.  We strive to create a true learning community.

The  symposia  have  provided  an  international  forum  for  the  discussion  of important current developments in research and theory-building related to self-directed learning, as well as opportunities to study successful models of the application of SDL concepts and processes in a rich variety of contexts. For those whose research focus is self-direction  in  learning,  the  symposia  offer  a  valuable  stimulus  to  research  and discussion  in  which  new  conceptualizations  and  applications  can  be  explored  and cooperative  research  efforts  germinated  and  nurtured.  This  opportunity  is  especially helpful for graduate students, who often comment in their evaluations of the experience.

A few comments reflect the participants' perceptions of the value of the Symposium:

- ¥ The Symposium was a wonderful opportunity to meet some of the major researchers in self-directed learning. . . . I think it should be on a must-

attend  list  for  any  student,  practitioner,  or  faculty  member  interested  in this line of research. . . .

- ¥ The  value  of  the  SDL  Symposium  for  me  is  that  we  talk  across boundaries and form a true learning community.

## Books and CDs Originating From the Symposia

After receiving feedback at the symposia, researchers are encouraged to revise their  papers  and  submit  them  for  publication.  From  1986  through  2003,  the  revised papers were then submitted for editorial review and selected papers were published as book chapters in print or CD format.  Sixteen books or CDs including 288 chapters were published.    An  index  to  the  chapters  was  created  by  a  symposium  attendee,  Travis Plowman, and it is accessible on the Society's website, (www.sdlglobal.com).

## The International Journal of Self-Directed Learning

Since 2004, researchers have been encouraged to submit their revised papers to this  peer-reviewed  journal,  the International Journal of Self-Directed Learning ,  which also accepts independent contributions.  Some of the presented papers have, of course, been submitted elsewhere for publication.  This journal marks the 15 th issue; 82 articles have been published, and the evidence indicates that the journal has been well-received. In  addition  to  numerous  citations  of  the  IJSDL  articles  in  other  refereed  journals,  the ISSDL has received a number of requests to link to specific articles, reprint, or repost them. A few examples:

- ∞ The  Canadian  College  of  Health  Leaders  incorporated  a  page  from Volume 5, Number 1, 'Why Self-Directed Learning?' to make the case for the value of self-directed learning in their Maintenance of Certification Program Policy and Requirements .
- ∞ Maurice  Gibbons  requested  permission  to  repost  the  lead  article  from Volume 7, Number 2 on his website.

An index by author and title is available on the ISSDL website (www.sdlglobal.com).

## The Malcolm Knowles Award

The first Malcolm Knowles Award was presented in 2001 to honor the memory of  Knowles' contributions to the field of self-directed learning and to recognize Huey Long, the Symposium's founder for his lifelong contributions to the field.  Nominations are now accepted only from the previous awardees. Sample documentation includes (a) involvement in SDL (research, practice, writing) for a lengthy portion of the nominee's career, (b) recognized research and/or publications in SDL, (c) supervision of doctoral students  researching  SDL,  (d)  development  or  implementation  of  an  innovation  that contributed  significantly  to  the  field,  and  (e)  other  important  contributions  to  the advancement of SDL.

Those  who  have  been  recognized  with  the  Malcolm  Knowles  Award  for significant lifelong contribution to the field of self-directed learning are:

- 2001 Huey B. Long, University of Oklahoma, U.S. (Emeritus)
- 2002 Lucy M. and Paul J. Guglielmino, Florida Atlantic University, U. S.
- 2004 Ralph G. Brockett, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, U.S.
- 2005 Roger Hiemstra, Syracuse University (Emeritus)
- 2006 Allen Tough, University of Toronto, Canada (Emeritus)
- 2007 Maurice Gibbons, Simon Fraser University, Canada (Emeritus) and Gary Confessore, George Washington University, U.S.(Emeritus)
- 2008 Richard Durr, Motorola University, Scottsdale, Arizona, U.S. (Retired)
- 2009 Sharan Merriam, University of Georgia, U.S. (Emeritus) and Rosemary Caffarella, Cornell University, New York, U.S.
- 2010 Philippe Carre, University of Paris, France
- 2011 Naomi Boyer, Polk State College, Florida, U.S. and Robert Bulik, LPI Global Consultants, Texas, U.S.

The first 25 years have been productive, generating helpful research findings and many new questions to be explored at future symposia.

## L'Autoformation : The State Of Research

## On Self- (Directed) Learning In France

## Philippe Carré, Annie Jézégou, Jonathan Kaplan, Pascal Cyrot, and Noël Denoyel

The term autoformation (literally,  self-learning)  first  appeared  in  French literature on education in the early 1970's, within the wake of the lifelong education  movement.  Globally,  the  notion  of  autoformation  may  be viewed according to five complementary perspectives: radical (autodidactism), sociocognitive, educational, organizational, and biographical, which are presented here. These diverse views are united by a  common  thread:  the  role  of  agency, i.e. the  human  capacity  to  make choices and decisions and act on one's own, in the field of adult learning and  development.  Paradoxically,  at  a  time  when  the  European  Union promotes the image of a lifelong, independent learner within a cognitive society  in the making,  autoformation  appears  as  both  essential  and hazardous for the future of adult education in France.

The term autoformation (literally, self-learning) first appeared in French literature  on  education  in  the  early  1970's,  in  the  wake  of  the  lifelong  education movement, in the seminal writings of established authors such as Dumazedier (1985), Schwartz (1973), and Pineau (1977). A first collection of articles specifically devoted to the topic appeared a few years after the upsurge of the concept of self-directed learning in  North  America  (Dumazedier,  1985).  By  the  end  of  the  1980's  a  link  between  both strands  of  research  was  established  in  France  and  Quebec  (Carré,  1992;  Tremblay, 2003).

For the past 25 years, a common  thread has united several views of autoformation, which will be presented here. Whichever the focus, each of them stresses a  common  paradigm  of  agency  in  learning  and  self-development.  The  concept  of autoformation places the emphasis on the learner's personal control of his or her learning (learning  by  oneself),  as  opposed  to  the  idea  of heteroformation (learning  through  the action of others). In spite of differences and even oppositions between perspectives that we shall examine in this paper, all of them underline the agentic dimension of learning. The idea of autoformation implies looking at education, learning, and development from the angle of the agent's personal power to act, as the French philosopher Ricˇur (1986) put  it,  in  accordance  with  Bandura's  image  of  people  as  'at  least  partial  architects  of their own destinies' (1997, p. 8). According to this view, there is room for freedom and choice  in  the  individual's  way  of  leading  his  or  her  life  and  learning,  alongside  and

beyond the constraints  of  historical,  social,  and  biographical  determinants  that  French sociology  and  clinical  psychology  have  repeatedly  uncovered  for  the  past  50  years. Within this common paradigmatic view, there is room for autoformation as a powerful agentic lever of human learning and change.

Globally, the notion of autoformation may  be  viewed  according  to five complementary  perspectives.  According  to  the  oldest  view,  which  could  be  labeled radical , what is at stake is the learner's complete control of his or her learning, in total independence  from  educational  agents  or  institutions.  We  are  close  to  the  historical notion of autodidactism here. Secondly, a more psychological, sociocognitive approach, draws us closer to the North American notion of self-directed learning, with a deliberate focus on the psychological dimensions of adult learning (Long, 1989; Carré, Moisan, &amp; Poisson, 2010).  When leaders and teachers endeavor to promote learners' self-direction within  schools,  training  centers  or  open  learning  programs,  we  are  faced  with  a  third educational conception of autoformation. Fourth, an organizational perspective examines collective practice of autonomous learning in 'natural' settings such as trade unions, voluntary organizations, companies and local communities. Lastly, a biographical outlook, strongly linked to the phenomenological approach of life histories, focuses  on  human  experience  as  deciphered  and  analyzed  by  the  agent  himself  or herself. Let us now turn to these different views.

## Radical Perspective: Autodidactism

Autodidactism is an old term. It comes from the Greek autos (self) and didaskein (to teach) and is synonymous with self-teaching. There are many different terms for selfeducation. As Tough (1967) writes,

…Self-teaching has also been called self-instruction, self-education, independent study,  individual  study  and  self-directed  study.  The  term  self-teacher  has  been used  to  refer  to  any  person  while  he  [sic]  is  engaged  in  self-teaching.…  Selfteachers have also been called autonomous learners, self-propelled learners, and autodidacts. (p. 3)

As an archetypal figure of clandestine learning, the autodidact epitomizes in Europe a bygone way of learning. When sociologists became interested in this issue they devised a  sociological  category  for  autodidacts.  Some  recognized  that  autodidacts  lose  their sense of belonging to a social class in their cultural promotion efforts; others distinguish the old-style autodidacts from the new-style ones, or the true from the false. Obviously, these  scientific  works  are  very  helpful  for  the  understanding  of  this  ancestral  and particular way of learning, but now it seems more appropriate to work on the process of self-teaching  in  a  world  where  knowledge  is  more  and  more  short-lived;  a  world  that prompts everyone to indulge in independent learning at some point. Today's processes of  self-teaching  are  in  effect  different  from  the  old  ones.  Compulsory  schooling  does away  with  the  entirely  personal  learning,  which  carries  the  mythical  model  of  the autodidact,  and  invites  us  to  focus  on  the  activity.  We  can  then  consider  that  a  selfteaching  episode  develops  outside  of  the  school  environment  and  independently  of  a

full-time  tutor  or  mentor.  One  also  needs  to  distinguish  between  intentional  and unintentional learning.  Such episodes are free of any external aims or syllabi, but may rely on the help of others.

In  line  with  the  French  concept  of apprenance (Carré,  2005),  autodidactism exists, and has always existed, in all professions. We encounter autodidactism in ancient Greece  as  well  as  in  Arab  philosophy;  in  working  classes  as  well  as  in  upper  ones; during the French Renaissance as well as among African-American slaves. Characteristics of autodidactism differ through the ages. For example, during the Age of Enlightenment, autodidactism seems to have mainly been an aristocratic peculiarity; but, right  after  the  French  Revolution  it  seems  to  have  become  extremely  proletarian.  As much  as  historians  have  neglected  this  issue,  educationalists  have  worked  on  it  ever since the late 1960's. Across the Atlantic, Tough (1967) focused on adult self-teaching projects and questioned the reasons for beginning and pursuing a learning episode; Spear and  Mocker  (1984)  underlined  the  organizing  circumstances  in  self-directed  learning; and Tremblay (1981) studied the needs for assistance during self-teaching periods.  More recently  in  France,  Le  Meur  (1998)  identified  the  elements  of  a  professional  neoautodidactism; Verrier (1999) endeavored to gain better understanding of contemporary self-teaching; while Bézille-Lesquoy (2003) noticed the discrepancies between autodidactic representations and practices. Nevertheless, self-teaching is seldom considered  through  the  relationships  which  support  it.  If  we  focus  on  self-teaching sociabilities, we can easily identify that self-teachers' social networks are very important throughout past and contemporary independent learning phases (Cyrot, 2007). Furthermore, the new social networking websites (FaceBook, Hi5…) bring this issue to the fore. Through vastly increased possibilities of high-speed horizontal communication between peers, opportunities for group autodidactism are soaring.

Scientific  interest  in  the  matter  certainly  prompts  new  respect  for  this  kind  of learning. Indeed, often derided in literature or in everyday life, the formerly stigmatized self-learner  is  gaining  increasing  legitimacy  in  France;  more  so  since  legislation  on Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) came into effect on January 17, 2002 (Minist GLYPH&lt;143&gt; re de l' ƒ ducation Nationale, 2011), allowing academic institutions to deliver formal recognition for curricular units; and, if all requisites are fulfilled, to deliver degrees on the basis of life experiences.

## Social-Cognitive Perspective: Self-Direction in Learning

The  next  perspective  on  autoformation  is  directly  inspired  by  the  works  of several North American authors on self-directed learning from the 1960's and 1970's, such  as  Houle  (1961),  Knowles  (1975),  Long  (1975),  Tough  (1967),  Hiemstra  (1976) and  Guglielmino  (1978),  as  noted  by  Carré  (1992).  A  global  sociocognitive  model  of self-learning  was  gradually  elaborated  on  this  basis,  using  three  key  psychological concepts targeting both to better understand agentic learning processes, and to understand  environmental  conditions.  The  emerging  theory  articulates  the  concepts  of self-determination, self-regulation and self-efficacy within a common framework (Carré, Moisan, &amp; Poisson, 2010).

Self-determination theory (Deci &amp; Ryan, 2000) helps us identify the role of selfprocesses in human motivation, choice and decision-making within the area of learning and  education.  The  self-determination  continuum  spans  the  gamut  of  possibilities between  absence  of  motivation  and  fully  self-determined  action,  with  varying  otherdetermined  forms  of  action  in  between.  What  is  at  stake  here  is  the  understanding  of personal control (or the lack thereof) in learning projects, educational choice, commitment, persistence and efficiency in adult training and development. The core of research efforts in this domain is on adult learners' initial motivation, decision, freedom and choice to learn… or not to.

When  it  comes  to  actual  learning  behavior,  self-regulated  learning  theory (Schunk &amp; Zimmerman, 2008) provides us with an ideally suited empirical and notional framework in order to investigate and promote agency during the learning process itself, once the decision to embark on a learning project has been made. There is a surprising lack  of  interaction  between  the  two  research  traditions  of  self-regulation  and  selfdirection in learning, which opens an avenue for empirical and theoretical work within the sociocognitive perspective of autoformation.

Underlying  the  two  basic  concepts  of  self-determination  and  self-regulation,  a third  milestone  of  the  sociocognitive  approach  is  self-efficacy,  also  encompassed  by self-determination  theory  under  the  heading  of  perception  of  competence.  The  role  of self-efficacy in self-directed learning has been delineated in numerous recent studies. It is a major determinant of both self-determined and self-regulated action and thought. As Bandura (1997) states, 'Unless people believe that they can produce desired results by their actions, they have little incentive to act or to persevere in the face of difficulties' (pp.  3-4).  It  seems  quite  obvious  that  this  central  statement  applies  strongly  to  selfdirected learning issues.

The sociocognitive approach formulates autoformation as the dynamic interplay of self-determination (an autonomous, authentic free will to learn), self-regulation (the exercise of agentic, self-controlled learning activity) and self-efficacy. Current research in  this  area  in  France  has  contributed  to  endorse  the  model  with  empirical  meaning, based on field studies of nurses, medical doctors, managers, entrepreneurs and teachers (Carré,  Moisan,  &amp;  Poisson,  2010).  Future  research  using  this  approach  should  enable establishing a link with the educational perspective presented below, in order to further elaborate on issues relating to learning environments that are favorable to self-directed learning. The  notions  of  autonomy  supportive,  enabling,  or  capacitating  learning environments,  whether  they  be  thought  of  in  terms  of  instructional  design,  informal learning or digital resources, are crucial here.

## Educational Perspective: Self-Learning Environments

Another  important  trend  in  research  and  practice  in  autoformation  and  selfdirected  learning  focuses  on  open  and  distance  learning  environments,  designed  and implemented by in-house corporate training, adult education providers, and institutions of higher education. Environments designed to individualize instruction so as to foster more self-direction  in  learning  can  be  found  in  classrooms,  adult  learning  groups  and

many face-to-face situations (Hiemstra &amp; Sisco, 1990). But, most of the discussion on the educational perspective in recent years in France has focused on open and distance learning.  These  environments  take  on  forms  such  as  multimedia  resource  centers, settings for individualized training, or e-learning. Instructional design in these environments endeavors to support the expression and development of the learner's selfdirection.  In  France,  Jézégou  (2005)  points  to  two  main  levers  that  can  be  used  to achieve this.

The first lever is to provide the learner with opportunities for personal decisions or self-determination in the choice of various components of the learning environment, while helping the person to regulate management of these components (Hiemstra, 2000; Jézégou, 2005). The learning environments are shaped by training modalities, pedagogical methods, course documents, distance communication tools, human resources or spatial and temporal aspects of learning situations (Jézégou, 2008). One is able to promote learner self-direction by providing the learner with freedom of choice in the determination of these. The learner can thus exercise control over the structure and manage  learning  situations  (Garrison,  2003;  Jézégou,  2005).  However,  opening  to freedom  of  choice  does  not  automatically  guarantee  the  learner  will  be  self-directing. Two fundamental aspects are in play here.  The first is the learner's motivation to seize that freedom of choice, while the second refers to his or her ability to exercise control over  the  learning  settings.    An  instructor  may  play  a  facilitating  role  in  helping  the learner make choices, organize and manage the various aspects in these settings. To be effective,  the  educational  intervention  requires  transactions  based  on  dialogue  and negotiation between instructor and learner according to their respective constraints and resources (Brockett &amp; Hiemstra, 1991; Dron, 2007; Jézégou, 2005).

The second instructional design lever to support expression and development of self-direction  in  learning  is  to  create  the  organizational,  pedagogical  and  technical conditions to encourage collaboration between learners at a distance. Collaboration here is seen as the conditions that enable learners to engage in a joint and common approach for  solving  a  problem  or  conducting  a  project.  A  distance  collaborative  approach  is based  on  transactions  between  learners  (Garrison  &amp;  Anderson,  2003;  Jézégou,  2010). Transactions  are  social  interactions  built  on  confrontations  of  points  of  view,  on negotiations  and  deliberations.  They  are  promoted  when  the  socio-emotional  climate generated  by  the  interactions  between  learners  is  based  on  asymmetry  of  the  social relationship  and  affability  (Jézégou,  2010).  Despite  the  geographical  distance  between learners, these transactions and climate create a cognitive and socio-emotional presence which,  in  turn,  contributes  to  the  emergence  and  the  development  of  a  learning community  (Jézégou, 2010). In addition, this collaborative dynamic allows the expression of self-direction by each learner in the group. On one hand, it encourages the learner to participate in making choices and organizing all aspects of the collaborative space, and in the collective management of these aspects, while controlling his or her behavior  during  interactions  with  other  learners,  as  well  as  his  or  her  emotions  and motivation.  On  the  other  hand,  this  collaborative  dynamic  may  enable  the  learner  to satisfy a need for affiliation and belonging to a community, which is a driving force for his or her distance learning. Such an approach, both collective and individual, may be encouraged by an instructor who acts as coordinator, moderator and animator. Through

such  interventions,  and  despite  geographic  distance,  the  educational  agent  embodies  a pedagogical presence for the learners and supports not only the transactions and socioemotional interactions existing within the learning community, but also motivation and strategies  of  self-regulation  of  each  learner  in  the  community  (Jézégou,  2010).  These two  main  levers,  together  or  independently,  contribute  to  open  and  distance  learning environments supporting the expression and development of learners' self-direction.

## Socio-Organizational Perspective: Collective Self-Learning

In  contrast  with  the  previous  perspective,  the  Socio-Organizational  Perspective of  autoformation  or  self-learning  focuses  on  learning  processes  organized  outside  of education institutions. This type of self-learning takes place in associations, unions and other  instances  of  civil  society.  It  may  also  designate  learning  that  takes  place  in corporations when it is part of the daily work environment. The fact that the learning is integrated  into  regular  activities  distinguishes  these  forms  of  self-learning  from  the previous category which relates to institutionalized education.

Self-learning in groups relies on collective organization of the learning activities by  the  persons  implicated.  This  distinction  sets  collective  self-learning  apart  from autodidactic self-learning. In collective self-learning collective aims and individual aims need  to  be  accommodated  for  in  the  pursuit  of  learning  goals.  In  this  type  of  selflearning the weight of collective aims on one hand, and those of individuals on the other, can  result  in  varying  degrees  of  perceived  control  over  choice,  management,  and orientation of the learning.  This does not imply that individuals risk feeling that they do not  have  as  much  control  as  they  may  wish  to  when  collective  aims  are  strong.  First, collective aims may be endorsed by individuals; and secondly, individual aims can coexist harmoniously with collective aims. By all means, effective learning is a question of the  suitability  of  that  which  is  learned  within  a  social  context.  In  such  cases  where collective  learning  settings  promote  self-direction,  the  balance  between  individual  and collective aims becomes tangible when the boundaries of the self blur. In research that inquired into learner self-direction in Study Circles, learners could not easily distinguish between their inner self and their collective one when asked about their strategies when regulating their learning. Moreover, learning regulation strategies were more often than not, perceived as collective (Kaplan, 2010a).

One can classify in the category of collective self-learning, networks of learners such as those organized by the Reciprocal Exchange  of  Knowledge  Movement (Mouvement  des  réseaux  d'échanges  réciproques  de  savoirs)  (Héber-Suffrin,  2001) where individual  goals  are  salient;  nevertheless,  embedded  in  collective  organizing  of the learning.  Study Circles (Oliver, 1987; Kaplan, 2010b), which were used at the end of the nineteenth century and became culturally embedded during the twentieth century in  Sweden  and  the  Nordic  countries,  are  illustrative  of  a  format  in  which  social  aims weighed more; at least this was the intention of the unions that organized them when they  were  initially  launched  in  Sweden.  The  reemergence  of  the  format  in  the  mid nineteen eighties in other parts of the world, sometimes referred to as Learning Circles, is generally underpinned by aspirations for social change also.

These examples are given as an illustration of collective self-learning; nevertheless, many other such forms of learning occur in communities of learners. Selfdirected  work  teams  and  the  learning  organization  (Senge,  2006)  are  other  forms  of collective self-learning that, in the latter examples, emerge in organizational environments.  One can find many other examples in communities of practice (Wenger, 1998) such as in associations, unions, activist groups or the professions ( e.g. physicians, software programmers, educators).

When realizing  the  scope  and  effectiveness  of  learning  in  collective  situations (communities  of  practice,  communities  of  learners,  online  communities,  etc.)  one  can hardly ignore their potential power to shape the environments people inhabit. Realizing this opens up perspectives for the development of these forms of collective self-learning, if not as a new social reality, at least with renewed interest.

## Biographical Perspective: Existential and Experiential Self-Learning

The biographical perspective on existential autoformation, or self-learning, aims to  cope  with  the  harsh  modern  and  postmodern  experience  of  incompleteness  in  adult life.  Life  is  not  an  achieved given. It still remains something to be done, repeated and reflected on; something to which a shape must be given. This intrinsic incompleteness of life  literally  founds  the  necessity  for  an  ongoing  process  of  shaping  life  and  giving meaning to it through biography-forming approaches. In the context of lifelong learning in French-speaking regions, the biographical perspective, the concept of autoformation and  the  research  on  what  is  possibly  learned  through  experiential  learning  emerged simultaneously, and to a certain extent in a conjunct manner, in the 1970's and 1980's. They were thought to deal with essential and unseen issues, emerging on existential and experiential levels.

Pineau  and  Marie-Michèle's  (1983)  book Produire  sa  vie,  autoformation  et autobiographie , can be seen as a sign of the emergence of a biographical perspective and of autoformation in the early 1980's. Its title underlines a vital constructivist perspective by  using  the  prefix auto recurrently  in  order  to  indicate  a  dual  appropriation;  by  the individual  of  his  or  her  own  training,  and  of  the  written  expression  of  his  or  her  life story. Pineau conceives life narratives as tools allowing a process of autoformation based on a dialogical co-investment, by the narrator and the listener, of a story in which both promoting and hindering episodes are considered. Through such a process the narrator produces  a  story  of  his  or  her  life.  The  biographical  perspective  can  be  understood through  the  use  of  three  different  terms:  autobiography,  life  narrative,  and  biography (Delory-Momberger, 2003; Pineau &amp; Le Grand, 1992).

The term existential autoformation made its appearance in 1995 in an issue of the journal Education  Permanente entitled L'autoformation  en  chantiers (Self-learning under  construction)  and  edited  by  the  Groupe  de  Recherche  sur  l'Autoformation (GRAF).  In 1997 Galvani's (1997) book Quête de sens et formation (Quest for meaning and  education)  was  published.    Existential  autoformation  has  been  studied  since  with innovative  phenomenological  approaches  such  as  life  narratives,  learning  blazons  and other projective methods.

As  early  as  1991,  based  on  Dewey's  works,  Courtois  and  Pineau  (1991) popularized  the  neologism experiential in  the  book La  Formation  Expérientielle  des Adultes  Adults' Experiential Learning ( ) and thus anticipated the law on RPL, passed in France in 2002. Denoyel (1999) has been working on pragmatism and semiotics in order to  formalize  the  concept  of experiential  reason through  a  ternary  model:  perceptive, experiential and formal. Ferry (1991), after analyzing the power of experience, explores the  Peircean  distinction  between  icon,  index  and  symbol,  in  order  to  configure  the cognitive grammars of intelligence. Mezirow (2001) validates the reflexive turn (Schön, 1991)  and  suggests  thinking  over  one's  experience  to  develop  self-learning  as  an emancipatory practice. In his view, a lived experience becomes a vital one only when it is exposed to the community, where it must be fed with otherness. As in the case of the related  concept  of  autodidacy,  autoformation  must  be  accompanied,  as  it  is  in  trade unions: this training cannot be self-sufficient. Experiential continuity, as Dewey put it, is a matter of process. Biographical approaches may reveal, through ongoing experiences one lives, moments of intense autoformation; moments that singularize our lives and that cannot be achieved through teaching.

## Hopes and Perils of Autoformation

The notional and practical universe of autoformation or self-learning is rooted in the  traditional,  historical  and  literary  vision  of  autodidactism.  It  also  explores  the potential  of  the  most  up-to-date  learning  resources  of  the  information  society.  This 'galaxy' of seemingly diverse notions, based on independent empirical and theoretical traditions  and  references,  is  held  together  by  the  common  paradigm  of  agency  that accounts for the individual's personal control and responsibility over his or her learning and educational career.  This shared vision of a fully adult, autonomous learner, as the goal of education in the 21  century, is fully supported by the ideological and political st program  enshrined  in  the  slogans  of cognitive  society,  knowledge  economy ,  and  the lifelong learner (Carré, 2005).  Yet, we must remain watchful of the perils of a radically liberal understanding that entails the risk of putting tomorrow's learner in a dangerous position  of  being  the  sole  manager  of  his  or  her  education.  Contemporary  forms  of educational  Darwinism  are  thus  at  work  under  the  banner  of  autoformation  and  selfdirected learning that could lead to neglecting or abandoning those adults who cannot turn to self-directed learning for lack of personal resources, motivation or information. One  of  the  ambiguities  of  the  autoformation  /  self-directed  learning  paradigm  is  that agency in learning may at once be indispensable at the individual pedagogical level of analysis, and highly hazardous at the macro-political level.  This paradoxical pitfall calls for even  more  collaboration  between  sociologists,  psychologists  and  educationists around what remains the most promising track of research into authentic adult learning in the years to come.

## New Perspectives on Post-Formal Cognitive Development and Self-Directed Learning

## Carol Kasworm

This  investigation  expands  the  current  discussion  on  the  theoretical  and practice relationship of hypothesized developmental levels of self-directed learning in relation to post-formal cognitive development. It is suggested that the conceptual understandings of post-formal cognitive development provided a potent and conceptually significant area for differentiating the nature of engagement and meaning-making for adult self-directed learners. The current discussion considers this qualitative differentiated complexity of  self-directed  learning  through  the  research  and  writings  of  Baxter Magolda and Kegan.

What  is  the  relationship  between  cognitive  development  and  the  learner's engagement in self-directed learning? In 1983, I suggested that the 'acts of self-directed learning' should be conceptually framed through adult developmental theories, focused upon qualitative cognitive and affective change and growth (Kasworm, 1983, p. 632). My central  intent  was  to  explore  and  understand  the  differences  among  learners  who participated  in  interior  acts  of  self-directed  learning  beyond  the  procedural  strategies (often  presented  through  pedagogical  language)  (Brockett  &amp;  Hiemstra,  1991;  Candy, 1991; Knowles, 1975). I was curious about the differences among adult learners in acts of self-directed learning - and hypothesized that they were operating at different levels of the Perry's Scheme of Cognitive and Ethical Development.  In my research, reflecting a  variety  of  studies  (Kasworm,  1982,  1983,  1988,  1992;  Kasworm  &amp; Blowers, 1994), these individuals described their experiences of self-directed learning in very different ways, reporting that their understandings and processes of enacting self-directed learning were understood and were enacted from different set of world views, assumptions, and beliefs.

In addition, these experiences were documented from both individual interviews of  engagement  in  self-directed  learning  as  well  as  classroom  observations  of  these individuals utilizing the structure of a learning contract and the key focus of engaging in self-directed  learning  for  class  projects.  The  grounding  conceptual  article  in  1983  and subsequent research suggested that post-formal cognitive development provided a potent and  conceptually  significant  area  for  differentiating  the  nature  of  engagement  and meaning-making  for  adult  self-directed  learners.  For  example,  some  of  these  learners spoke  to  either  a  change  of  world-view  perspective  or  of  insights  to  a  new  set  of understandings  during  their  self-directed  learning  endeavors,  while  other  individuals spoke  to  a  more  additive  knowledge  and  skill  exploration  and  to  maintenance  of  an

ongoing world view. Further, as part of this reconceptualization of self-directed learning in  1983,  the  then-recent  work  of  Mezirow  and  key  understandings  of  transformative learning  further  illuminated  conceptual  understandings  of  the  potential  complexity  of self-directed learning.

Thus, the 1983 article suggested key conceptual relationships and assumptions of self-directed learning vis a vis adult development through Perry's scheme of post-formal cognitive  development  and  Mezirow's  transformational  learning  theory.  Self-directed learning was judged not to be the simplistic development of uni-dimensional or linear sequential  acts  of  learning;  rather,  there  was  a  qualitative  cognitive  and  affective progression in complexity and depth of development in relation to learner knowledge, skills, and attitudes that impacted the nature and conditions of the learner's engagement in  self-directed learning.  This perspective suggested that it was ' a three-dimensional relationship to include (a) levels of behavior or skill; (b) levels of cognitive complexity; and (c) level of affective/value orientation to knowledge  and  learning actions' (Kasworm,  1983,  p.  45).    Further,  the  interactional  characteristics  of  this  model suggested  a  'transformation,  a  paradigm  shift…  towards  (a)  an  active  creator  of  new learning events, (b) maker of new meaning of the learner's reality and (c) the learner's development of a new component of knowledge and skills' ( p. 35).  In addition, these qualitative  changes  suggested  a  conceptual  relationship  with  the  recently  formulated transformational  theory  of  the  influence  of  critical  disjunctures  impacting  qualitative changes of one's world view, self as learner, and self as creator of knowledge.

Since  this initial presentation,  other  researchers  have  also  recognized  this conceptual relationship between cognitive development and key developmental differences in learner's acts of learning (self-directed learning) (Candy, 1991; Hofer &amp; Pintrich, 1997; Merriam, 2004).  For example, more recent discussions have argued that self-directed  learning  doesn't  always  occur  on  a  known  cartographic  knowledge  map; the holistic landscape of knowledge is often not known prior to starting a self-directed learning project. Thus, the learner has a unique and important engagement of cognitive responsibility  not  only  for  'organizing  events,'  but  to  engage  in  initial  experiences which are  murky  and  ill-defined,  reflecting  a  potential  change  or  disjuncture  in  one's current cognitive scheme. In addition, a learner may seek a self-directed learning journey which  does  not  meet  his  or  her  initial  goals  or  desires.  Further,  these  involvements sometimes result in learning how to learn , with the adult facing new challenges to gain skill in a technology, to gain new metacognitive skills in the learning efforts, in another area of skill development, or in a new content of language and discourse structures as a foundation for pursuits of desired knowledge and skill. Lastly, self-directed learning is not always obvious learning, reflecting a learner's beliefs about the task of self-directed learning.  Engagement in self-directed learning can represent unplanned and disjunctural engagements; learners in self-directed learning may experience the shadowed engagements by exploring new possibilities in critical thinking, of challenges to one's assumptions and beliefs about areas of presumed knowledge and skill, or of a discomfort that may conflict with existing attitudes, values, or beliefs.  However, little research and discussion has focused upon these possibilities. As noted in a recent discussion regarding self-directed learning with ill-defined and complex explorations,

Meaningful  and  worthwhile  learning  must  view  external  task  control  and cognitive  responsibility  concerns  as  integral  and  reciprocal  constructs.  For example, self-direction simply focused on task control neglects the critical issues of setting goals that are relevant and meaningful as well as neglecting cognitive strategies  and  opportunities  to  question  accepted  orthodoxies.  An  adult  learner who is fully self-directed has moved beyond simple task control and learned to think critically and construct meaning in ill-defined and complex content areas. (Garrison &amp; Archer, 2000, p. 95)

While  most  recent research and scholarship of self-directed learning has contributed limited in-depth examination  of  an  individual's meaning-making  and cognitive  strategies  or  the  conceptual  focus  on  self-regulation  of  learning,  there  have been significant collateral engagements and explorations in other disciplinary areas. In particular,  there  are  a  number  of  scholars  and  practitioners  who  are  developing  new conceptual  understandings  and  related  applications  of  adult  cognitive  development within educational psychology, adult development,  and higher education student development.  Building  upon  the  1983  presentation,  this  paper  will  explore  these enhanced  understandings  and  specific  intersections  of  recent  research  and  writings focused upon post-formal cognitive development and related understandings of transformative learning.  Specifically, this paper will review recent work and discussions by  Baxter  Magolda  and  Kegan  regarding  the  construct  of self-authorship and  of  the related understandings of transformative learning as part of the differentiated movement towards the self-authoring mind and to a more complex level of the self-transforming mind.  This  operational  construct  of  the  self-authoring  mind  has  become  a  significant focus of practitioner and researcher understandings concerning the development of postformal cognitive development (now labeled constructive development) and of constructive  pedagogy  for  engaging  adult  learners.  Although  these  individuals  have focused  their  research  and  writings  predominantly  upon  the  context  of  undergraduate higher education, I suggest that their work has significant implications for furthering our understandings  of  the  complexity  and  nature  of  the  broader  contexts  of  self-directed learning (Baxter Magolda, 1999; Kegan, 2000; Mezirow &amp; Associates, 2000).

## Meaning-Making and Self-Authorship: Kegan's Perspectives

In contextualizing this current discussion, the 1983 Kasworm article posited a set of understandings that focused upon social constructivist principles and of the nature of meaning-making as a core of self-directed learning development. In addition, it anchored the  nature  of  self-directed  learning  development  also  within  the  adult  development arena, suggesting that systems of adult development evolve through stability and change moving towards greater  complexity  and  differentiation.  Kegan's  work  (1982)  in  adult development also placed adult activity-and the evolution-of meaning making at the core of development. He suggested that our meaning-making structures are a combination  of  elements  over  which  we  have  control  (what  Kegan  calls object )  and elements  that  have  control  over  us  (what  Kegan  calls subject ),  and  that  growth  is 'liberating ourselves from that in which we were embedded, making what was subject

into  object  so  that  we  can  'have  it'  rather  than  'be  had'  by  it'  (1982,  p.  34).    This conceptual understanding is a holistic evolution drawing upon all elements of a human's engagement in life.   As suggested by Baxter Magolda, 'this portrayal of self-evolution integrates thinking and feeling, cognition and affect, self and other' (2009, p. 623).  In discussing this  notion  of  meaning-making,  Kegan  (1994)  asserted  that  adults,  in  these modern times, face demands for adapting the way that they organize their experiences, 'the evolution of consciousness' (p. 9). This consciousness 'is the personal unfolding of ways of organizing experience that are not simply replaced as we grow but subsumed into more complex systems of mind' (Kegan, 1994, p. 9).  Kegan, for example, suggests that as workers, adults are expected to 'invent or own our work, to [be] self-initiating, self-correcting, self-evaluating…to be guided by our own visions…to take responsibility for what happens to us…to be accomplished masters of our particular work roles, jobs, or careers' (p. 153). At the heart of these understandings and actions are the expectations of self-authorship; they require the ability to construct one's own visions, make informed decisions  in  conjunction  with  coworkers,  act  appropriately,  and  take  responsibility  for those actions.

Kegan's work  has also focused upon the interrelationship of conceptual understandings between his theory and Mezirow's (Mezirow &amp; Associates, 2000) theory of transformative learning. Kegan  (2000)  suggested that from  his perspective, transformative learning is viewed as an epistemological change, rather than a change in behavioral repertoire or a change in the quantity or fund of knowledge.  Elaborating on Mezirow's  theory,  Kegan  viewed  this  particular  type  of  learning  as  epistemological engagement in two different arenas.  The first arena of epistemological engagement is meaning-forming, 'the activity which we shape a coherent meaning out of raw material of our inner and outer experiencing' (p. 52). The second arena is meaning reforming, in which  we  change  our  epistemologies.  This  change  of  epistemologies  or  change  of worldview  represents  the  essence  of  transformative  learning  delineated  by  Mezirow. Thus, Kegan views reforming meaning, or transformative learning, as a developmental process  of  moving  away  from  external  authority  toward  self-authorship.  Mezirow defines transformative learning as:

The  process  by  which  we  transform  our  taken-for-granted  frames  of  reference (meaning perspectives, habits of mind, mind-sets) to make them more inclusive, discriminating, open, emotionally capable of change, and reflective so that they may generate beliefs and opinions that will prove more true or justified to guide action. (Mezirow &amp; Associates, 2000, pp. 7-8)

This expansion of meaning making also hinges on 'how we learn to negotiate and act on our own purposes, values, feelings, and meanings rather than those we have uncritically assimilated  from  others'  (p.  8).  Thus,  Kegan's  (1994)  work, In Over Our Heads: The Mental Demands of Modern Life ,  suggests  that  adults  can  best  adapt  to  the  chaos  and changing  understandings  of  modern  life  through  their  engagement  in  transformative learning and in creating a more complex set of world views, shifting from the Socialized Mind to the Self-Authoring Mind to the Self-Transforming Mind. Thus, educators who desire to enhance the capability of learners would foster a qualitative set of distinctions

among various sets of information and experiences and would recognize the significant cognitive  and  affective  engagement  of  transformation  of  self  and  world-view  in  these activities.

At the heart of these discussions is the core of an evolving self-directed learner. This  individual  would  not  only  engage  in  additive  knowledge  and  skill  development; but,  when faced by daunting experiences which impact upon the individuals' sense of epistemology, this individual would engage in changing views of the world and oneself. Thus, Kegan's work offers new understandings, insights, and supports for viewing the context and complexity of self-directed learning in this contemporary world.

## Meaning-Making, Self-Authorship, and Baxter Magolda

Throughout  her  academic  scholarship  career,  Baxter  Magolda  has  actively  explored post-formal cognitive development and constructivism through significant longitudinal research  studies  of  undergraduates  and  has  subsequently  followed  the  same  groups  as post-graduates (Baxter Magolda,  1999; Baxter Magolda,  2001). As  part of her theorizing, she also examined the implications of this descriptive theory for educators, suggesting an operational set of understandings for constructive-developmental pedagogy  and  the  importance  of  developing  self-authorship  (Baxter  Magolda,  1999). She suggested that self-authorship is simultaneously cognitive (how one makes meaning of  knowledge),  interpersonal  (how  one  views  oneself  in  relationship  to  others),  and intrapersonal (how one perceives one's sense of identity). The cognitive component of how people make meaning is their assumptions about the nature, limits and certainty of knowledge,  or  their  epistemic  assumptions.  The  shift  of  knowledge  from  certainty  to uncertainty is accompanied by a shift from viewing oneself as a receiver to a constructor of  knowledge. The intrapersonal component of meaning-making involves assumptions about  oneself.  Intrapersonal  growth  moves  from  distinguishing  one's  impulses  from oneself  and  identifying  enduring  qualities  of  the  self  to  experiencing  and  eventually authoring one's inner psychological life. Lastly, the interpersonal component hinges on assumptions about the relation of the self to others. Growth in this arena moves from lack of coordination of one's point of view with that of others, through subsuming one's own  view  to that of significant others, to developing a system that regulates interpersonal relationship (Baxter Magolda, 1999).

Drawing from her extensive longitudinal research studies of college students and post-college  adult  years  exploring  the  constructive  developmental  trajectories  of  adult learners, she suggests,

Self-authorship… is a complicated phenomenon.  It is simultaneously an ability to construct knowledge in a contextual world, an ability to construct an internal identity separate from external influences, and an ability to engage in relationships  without  losing  one's  internal  identity.  (Baxter  Magolda,  1999,  p. 12)

In  particular,  her  focus  has  been  on  formal  and  informal  higher  education  contexts, which  can  influence  this  constructive  development,  as  well  as  the  nature  of  selfauthorship, or the internal capacity to define one's beliefs, identity, and relationship.

In  her  development  of  this  conceptual  landscape,  she  identified  three  key elements of self-authorship, to include: trusting the internal voice, building an internal foundation, and securing internal commitments (Baxter Magolda, 2008, 2009). The first element  of  self-authorship,  trusting  the  internal  voice,  focused  upon  recognition  of reality: ' what happened in the world and their lives, was beyond their control, but their reactions  to  what  happened  was  [sic]  within  their  control'  (Baxter  Magolda,  2008,  p. 279). This recognition or realization was the basis for adult learners to take responsibility for 'choosing how to interpret reality, how to feel about their interpretation, and how to react' (Baxter Magolda, 2009, p. 631). This exploration and making choices has been suggested as comparable to the actions within the Mezirow's scheme  of  perspective  transformation--of  exploring  options  and  beginning  to  take actions. Baxter Magolda believes that this process of making choices in relation to one's reality  provides  the  catalyst  for  change  and  potentially  for  transforming  one's  journey towards  self-authorship.  The  second  element  is  focused  upon  building  an  internal foundation, suggested by Baxter as beginning 'to organize their choices into commitments that form a philosophy, or an internal foundation, to guide their ongoing reactions to reality'(Baxter Magolda, 2009, p. 632). The third element, securing internal commitments, focused upon moving beyond internal philosophy to living everyday life with those commitments. These second and third areas reflect a comparable understanding  of  Perry's  later  stages  of  ethical  commitments  such  as  building  and solidifying  the  contextual  relativist  stance  of  the  individual.  As  noted  by  Baxter Magolda,

These commitments automatically came into play as participants navigated the challenges of their lives, making  them  comfortable  with  the chaos they encountered.  These  commitments  also  offered  a  sense  of  security  that  led  to  a greater sense of freedom.  Trusting that they could use their foundations to make the best of what happened to them, they were more open to taking risks and to reevaluating their internal foundations. ( 2009, p. 632)

The anchoring of these three elements of self-authorship is embedded within an intentional  framework  promulgated  by  Baxter  Magolda  (1999,  2001)  of  three  key context assumptions for fostering self-authorship:

- 1. Knowledge is viewed as complex and socially constructed.
- 2. Self is viewed as central to constructing knowledge.
- 3. Authority and expertise are shared in the mutual construction of knowledge.

Her work adds an additional perspective and set of research engagements that support the  complex  differentiation  of  post-formal  cognitive  development  and  lead  to  a  more holistic  set  of  understandings  that  interact  with  the  person's  beliefs  and  values  as  a guiding referent.

## Why This Continuing Focus Upon Constructivist, Post-Formal Cognitive Development And Self-Directed Learning?

Self-directed  learning  is  an  extremely  complex  phenomenon.  It  is  a  process  of constructivist  understanding  and  development  towards  a  more  holistic  being  within  a lifespan perspective (Kasworm, 1983). As noted by King (2000),

As  individuals mature,  age-related (but not age-dictated) changes  become apparent  in  the  way  they  organize  and  reorganize  their  thinking  to  interpret experience. These changes are posited to evolve in cycles of differentiation and integration,  reflecting  developmental  patterns  of  increasing  complexity  and ability to connect elements. (p. 601)

As  more  complex  and  elaborate  mental  models  evolve,  each  new  approach  and understanding becomes incorporated, more automatic in response. These new understandings  and  approaches  become  part  of  the  everyday  way  of  perceiving  and acting. 'Each increasingly complex level may be considered a developmental benchmark,  one  that  is  built  on  prior  levels  and  sets  the  ground  work  for  subsequent levels' (p. 601). However, King warns about the naïve perceptions of this development and its often-assumed self-hedonistic focus. Rather, she states,

As John Dewey (1944) astutely noted, 'We never educate directly, but indirectly by means of the environment.  Whether we permit chance environments to do the  work,  or  whether  we  design  environments  for  the  purpose  makes  a  great difference' (p. 19). Experience is a key driver of development, and experience occurs  in  environments  that  may  or  may  not  be  designed  with  developmental purposes in mind. (King, 2009, p. 613)

Thus, King suggests that environments for fostering learner development require both supports and challenges.  King and Baxter Magolda have predominantly focused upon the undergraduate environment as the enriched educative environment offering opportunities for longer-term engagement of faculty and student learners in both content and  learning  development.  Further,  this  focus  has  become  an  important  discussion, because  of  its  implications  for  developing  critical  thinking,  a  major  goal  of  academic environments.

However, I should also share the finding of Baxter Magolda regarding her postgraduates  and  their  experiences  beyond  the  academic  environment.    These  graduates faced  renewed  challenges  in  the  adult  world  of  work  [post  undergraduate  studies], particularly in their independence of establishing a sense of adult self and also of being adult workers. As noted,

…They learned disciplinary content and process of thinking about it [an internal sense of self] and applying it. It was not until after college, however, that their employers  and  graduate  educators  stressed  that  their  thinking,  knowing,  and applying their perspectives to their work all hinged on their internal values and how they defined themselves. (2001, p. xxii)

In examining these postgraduate work experiences, she notes that a number of national authors  writing  on  college  graduate  preparation  for  the  work  setting  suggested  that employers expect developed skills in teamwork, critical thinking, interpersonal communications, as well as such skills as flexibility and innovation. However, because the participants after college graduation 'lacked this level of complexity and autonomy, many struggled to respond effectively. Their reliance on externally acquired formulas for success led them to expect those formulas in their work setting' (p. 240). Although most of  these  individuals  had  displayed  the  level  of  self-authorship  within  the  collegiate context, when they moved beyond the academic structures, they appeared to regress or potentially suggest an inability to operate in self-authorship in this new world context. Baxter  Magolda  suggested  that  campus  work  environments  needed  to  provide  a  more self-directing  environment  to  instill  these  younger  learners  with  a  scaffolding  base  to develop further meaning-making of themselves in relation to work life. Thus, reaching the  level  of  self-authorship  is  not  a  universal  strength  across  all  domains  of  the individual's  world  for  action  in  the  world  of  adulthood.  Could  this  mean  that  selfdirected learning as a support for self-authorship is context- or schema-based?

These three authors, Kegan, Baxter Magolda, and Mezirow, provide an enriched consideration that expands and enhances our understanding of self-directed learning. If one  reframes  the  readings  of  Baxter-Magolda  beyond  the  traditional  undergraduate higher education setting, one can identify the intellectual understandings and threads of self-directed learning engagement throughout her discussion. Her focus upon constructive pedagogy suggests a commitment to self-directedness of learner engagement in both formal learning experiences, as well as the broader investment in self development. Baxter Magolda raises issue with current dominant forms of teaching and  learning  and  of  student  services  within  higher  education.  She  suggests  that  the 'educational process requires moving away from the traditional forms of teaching and control-oriented forms of organizing student life…' (p. xxii). Thus, she views through her scholarship the importance of developing the qualities that have been identified as self-directedness  in  relation  to  the  constructivist  development  of  an  adult  self.  As scholars  of  self-directed  learning,  we  can  gain  much  from  her  work,  but  we  can  also provide another set of informed understandings to aid these notions of self-authorship towards a more holistic framework. In addition, Kegan offers a helpful developmental understanding  based  within  his  examination  of  the  complex  and  ambiguous  demands upon adult life. As with the examination of Baxter Magolda, there are significant threads that  suggest  an  adult's  engagement  in  self-directed  learning  is  instrumental  in  the individual's development and evolution of consciousness, of the developmental evolution  from  a  social  conscious  mind,  to  a  self-authoring  mind  toward  a  selftransforming mind. Kegan's work is clearly grounded in similar perspectives of adults gaining  autonomy  and  self-efficacy,  as  in  the  foundational  understandings  of  selfdirected learning.  Lastly, Mezirow's scholarly work on transformative learning and the many subsequent colleagues who have furthered these understandings offer a significant additional frame for us to explicate the nature and complexity of self-directed learning. It is evident from my preliminary research in the 1980's and subsequent research in the 1990's, the current significant research on transformative learning (Mezirow  &amp; Associates,  2000;  Taylor,  1998),  and  my  current  synthesis  of  transformative  learning

research in higher education settings (Kasworm &amp; Bowles, in-process) that transformative learning can be viewed as a self-directed engagement.

Adult learners are faced with challenging issues and tasks in this modern society. Our work is to focus a sustained spotlight on developing awareness within adult learners towards  the  continued  development  of  their  self-directed  learning  capabilities.  In addition, as educators we should continue to develop their skills and abilities for selfdirectedness,  as  well  as  offer  stimulating  environments  for  them  to  learn,  adapt,  and critique  this  new  or  challenging  way  of  acting  as  a  self-directed  learner.  Secondly,  as suggested  through  this  focus  on  transformative  learning,  development  within  selfdirected  learning  is  often  in  response  to  perceived  dissonance  or  disjunctures  of experiences and knowledge. It is difficult for adult self-directed learners to easily engage in an unknown or unvalued world-view change of their beliefs or assumptions. Further, these experiential challenges are grounded in affect and emotions of self and others, of values  of  self  and  the  world,  and  beliefs  of  how  the  world  and  its  components  work. Thus,  not  only  do  we  need  to  aid  adults  to  understanding  the  cognitive  work  of epistemological  change  and  development;  we  need  to  also  focus  upon  the  emotional, affective components of engaging in self-directed learning which challenge our sense of world  and  self. As  noted  in a number  of  discussions  of post-formal cognitive development (Kegan, 1982; Kegan, 1994; Perry, 1970), epistemological change within a learner is a highly complex and often affectively challenging set of experiences. Thus, within  self-directed  learning,  it  may  be  that  the  environment  of  people,  supports, experiences,  all  can  provide  a  significant  'holding  environment'  to  aid  the  learner's journey  towards  a  more  evolved  state  of  cognitive  complexity  or  of  consciousness (Kegan's construct).

It  is  evident that self-directed learning has become a valuable frame which can encompass  this  recent  scholarship  and  continue  to  demonstrate  the  importance  of understanding  post-formal  cognitive  development  in  relation  to  the  learner's  acts  of meaning making.  However, in examining Baxter Magolda's scholarship, there is need to further explore her underlying findings in relation to their salience for the autonomous actions of the adult learner beyond the collegiate setting. Baxter Magolda's research was housed  within  the  formal  higher  education  community  and  related  to  equipping educators to better prepare the traditional age student (18-24 years of age) for a more mature and vital adulthood in society. However, this work does not address the key role of  the  nonformal  and  informal  learning  world  for  an  adult  learner's  developmental journey in self-directed engagement. This opportunity to expand upon her understandings  is  significant.  Through  these  examinations  of  more  recent  scholarship, we face new interdisciplinary dialogues and research to guide us in the future.  For those of  you  working  with  self-directed  learning  research,  I  particularly  challenge  you  to consider these conceptualizations and their relationship to current and future scholarship as well as practice.

## An Exploration of Cultural Dimensions and Economic Indicators

## As Predictors of Self-Directed Learning Readiness

## Paul J. Guglielmino and Lucy M. Guglielmino

This  study  explored  Hofstede's  (2011)  cultural  dimensions  scores  for  Power Distance and Individualism and the economic indices of gross national income per capita (GNIPC) and gross domestic product per capita (GDPPC) as possible predictors of self-directed learning readiness in 17  country  samples.  The predictive relationships were significant and exceeded Cohen's (1992) criterion for a large effect size for each regression. The variance accounted for was also significant for each variable. The  relationship with Power  Distance  was negative; the others were positive.

The exponential expansion of knowledge, technology, and global interconnectedness have changed the world as we know it. Part of that change has been reflected in the way people learn, innovate, create, and produce.  Lifelong, self-initiated learning is now  increasingly recognized as essential for individuals to function effectively in their personal lives and in the workplace. At the global level , Revisiting Lifelong  Learning  for  the  21st  Century , a  publication  of  the  UNESCO  Institute  for Education ( Medel -An onuevo, Ohsako, &amp; Mauch, 2001), asserts:

As information and communication technologies (ICTs) permeate our societies and communities, the role of the individual learner is highlighted. Globalization has produced outcomes and processes which make the learning of new skills and competencies of paramount importance. Today it is no longer enough to have the same  living  and  working  skills  one  had  five  years  ago.  Learning  to  learn, problem solving, critical understanding and anticipatory learning - these are only a few of the core skills and competencies needed for all, at a time when 60% of trades and jobs to be performed in the next two decades or so are not yet known. (p. i)

The analysis also notes,  '…Lifelong learning as it is  presently  promoted  has  become more individual-oriented…. The emphasis of lifelong learning on the learner could be interpreted as assigning more agency to individuals in contrast to lifelong education's thrust on structures and institutions' (p. 4).  The recognition of the need for individuals to  assume  more  responsibility  for  their  own  learning  is  even  more  pronounced  in  the work  of  the  European  Union  (European  Commission,  2006)  and  is  more  explicitly linked  to  economic  well-being.  In  2006,  they  expanded  their  emphasis  on  learning  to

learn, initiative, and  entrepreneurship  and  produced  a  later  document  (European Commission  on  Education  and  Training,  2007)  detailing  the  key  competences  for lifelong learning that need to be developed and renewed at every level of education and training: 'the knowledge, skills and attitudes…which all individuals need for personal fulfilment and development, active citizenship, social inclusion and employment' (p. 3). Learning  to  learn and sense  of  initiative  and  entrepreneurship constitute  two  of  the eight  competences  and  are  described  as  equally  as  important  as  basic  skills  such  as communication, mathematical competence, and the like.

The recommendations  of these international bodies are aligned with the comments and findings of a number of prominent authors, who suggest that self-directed learning is increasingly viewed as a favored educational and training paradigm in postmodern economies (e.g., Bedard, 1997; Brockett &amp; Hiemstra, 1991; Candy, 1991; Carré, 1997; Costa &amp; Liebmann, 1997; Figueiredo, 2001; Guglielmino &amp; Guglielmino, 2006, 2008; Hiemstra, 1996; Long, 1999; Oliveira &amp; Simões, 2006; Papert, 2001; Pink, 2009; Straka, 1997, Zomorrodian, 1998).

While there are numerous studies linking readiness for self-directed learning to positive  personal  characteristics,  individual  achievement,  and  satisfaction,  this  paper focuses  on  relationships  to  cultural  dimensions  and  country  economic  indicators.  This line of research was suggested by a number of prior research findings. Several studies found positive links between self-directed learning readiness and workplace performance (for example, Durr, 1992; Guglielmino, 1996; Guglielmino &amp; Guglielmino, 1983, 1994; Guglielmino  &amp;  Klatt,  1994;  Oliveira,  Silva,  Guglielmino,  &amp;  Guglielmino,  2010; Roberts, 1986). Studies in many different countries have reported cultural differences in self-directed learning readiness  among  samples  drawn  from  business  or  students preparing for business careers; for example, Beitler, Mitlacher, and Faller (2005) found differences  in  SDLRS  means  in  German  and  U.S.  college  business  students;  and  an analysis of data from business samples in China, Guatemala, Hong Kong, Lithuania, and the U.S. found that the mean SDLRS differences by country are strongly correlated with Hofstede's (1980) cultural dimensions of Individualism (positively) and Power Dominance  (negatively).  The  self-directed  learning  readiness  means  of  the  country samples also were found to have a very strong positive correlation (above .90) with the gross national income per capita (GNIPC) of the countries (Guglielmino and Guglielmino, 2006).

The prior research suggests that some cultural values may support self-directed learning while others discourage it, and that there is a strong relationship between the SDL readiness of country business samples and the per capita income of the country. As the relationships were quite strong in the five countries examined previously, it appeared valuable  to  explore  these  relationships  across  an  expanded  sample  and  to  explore possible relationships with another economic indicator, country productivity (GDDPC).

## Purpose

The  purpose  of  this  study  was  to  determine  whether  the  self-directed  learning readiness  of  country  samples  could  be  predicted  by  Hofstede's  cultural  dimensions scores for power distance (PD) or individualism (IN) or by the economic indicators of

gross  national  income  per  capita  (GNIPC)  or  gross  domestic  product  per  capita (GDPPC).

This study of samples from 17 countries from Asia, Latin and Central America, North  America,  and  Europe  examines  the  culture  of  these  countries  based  upon Hofstede's    (2011)  cultural  dimensions  as  well  as  their  readiness  for  self-directed learning as measured by Guglielmino's Self-Directed Learning Readiness Scale (SDLRS). In addition, the study examines the standard of living of these countries as measured  by  gross  national  income  per  capita  (GNIPC)  as  well  as  gross  domestic product per capita (GDPPC).

## Research Questions

Two research questions guided this study:

- 1. Can  self-directed  learning  readiness  of  a  country  sample  as  measured  by  the SDLRS be predicted by Hofstede's cultural dimensions scores for Individualism, Power Distance, or a combination of the two?
- 2. Can  self-directed  learning  readiness  of  a  country  sample  as  measured  by  the SDLRS be predicted by the economic indicators gross national income per capita (GNIPC) or gross domestic product per capita (GDPPC) or a combination of the two?

## Method

## Instruments and Assessments

Hofstede's Dimensions of National Cultures. Hofstede, a social psychologist, began his comparison of nations in 1965, while employed as a travelling international staff member of IBM and later as a visiting professor at an international business school in  Switzerland.  In Culture's Consequences (Hofstede, 1980), he presented his cultural dimensions drawn from answers to attitude survey questions by (a) matched employee samples from 40 different countries and (b) his executive students, who represented 15 countries  and  a  variety  of  companies  and  industries.  Systematic  differences  between nations  were  found  for  questions  dealing  with  values.  His  research  has  continued  and expanded,  now  representing  two  additional  dimensions  and  76  countries  (Hofstede, 2010). This study examined the first two dimensions in relation to self-directed learning readiness.

The values that distinguished countries (rather than individuals) from each other grouped statistically into four clusters. These became the Hofstede dimensions of national  culture:  Power  Distance,  Uncertainty  Avoidance,  Individualism  versus Collectivism, and Masculinity versus Femininity. Between 1990 and 2002, these dimensions  were  largely  replicated  in  six  other  cross-national  studies  on  very different populations from consumers to airline pilots. (Hofstede, 2011, p.1)

Because of  significant  relationships  in  prior  studies,  the  variables  examined  in this analysis were Power Distance and Individualism. Descriptions of the two dimensions, adapted from Hofstede (2011) follow:

Power Distance. Power distance refers to the extent to which the less powerful members of organizations  and  institutions  accept  and  expect  that  power  is  distributed unequally.    In  cultures  with  a  high  level  of  power  distance,  the  society's  level  of inequality is endorsed by the followers as much as by the leaders.

Individualism. Individualism and its opposite, collectivism, represent the degree to which individuals are integrated into groups. In highly individualist societies the ties between individuals are loose: everyone is expected to look after her/himself and her/his immediate family. In collectivist societies, people are integrated from birth into strong, cohesive in-groups, often extended families that protect them in exchange for unquestioning loyalty.  Collectivism in this dimension refers to the group, not the state; it has no political meaning.

The  Self-Directed  Learning  Readiness  Scale (SDLRS). Developed  by  L. Guglielmino (1978), the SDLRS is a 58-item, Likert-type instrument designed to assess individual  attitudes,  values,  skills,  and  personality  characteristics  supportive  of  selfdirection in learning. The self-scoring form is called the Learning  Preference Assessment (Guglielmino &amp; Guglielmino, 1991). Expert judgment was used to ensure the content and construct validity of the instrument. A Delphi panel of 14 experts in the field  of  self-directed  learning  (including  Malcolm  Knowles  and  Allen  Tough,  among others)  were  involved  in  a  three-stage  process  to  develop  a  list  of  characteristics  of individuals with high levels of readiness for self-direction in learning. The panel arrived at consensus on the characteristics they deemed important for self-direction in learning, including attitudes, values, abilities, and personality characteristics.

Reported  reliability  figures  (Cronbach  alpha)  range  from  .72  to  .94.  Finestone (1984)  and  Wiley  (1981)  reported  test-retest  reliability  coefficients  of  .82  and  .79 respectively.  Based  on  a  population  of  3,151  individuals  from  the  United  States  and Canada,  a  split-half  Pearson  product  moment  correlation  with  a  Spearman-Brown correction  produced  a  reliability  figure  of  .94  (Guglielmino  &amp;  Guglielmino,  1991). There  have  been  some  criticisms  of  the  SDLRS  (Brockett,  1985;  Field,  1989),  which have been responded to by Long (1989), McCune (1989), and Guglielmino (1989). The vast majority of studies have supported the reliability and validity of the instrument (See, for  example,  Delahaye  &amp;  Smith,  1995;  Durr,  1992;  Finestone,  1984;  Graeve,  1987; Hassan, 1981; Long &amp; Agyekum, 1984; McCune &amp; Guglielmino, 1991; Posner, 1990, 1991; Russell, 1988).  The SDLRS is the most widely-used quantitative instrument in the study  of  self-directed  learning  (Merriam,  Caffarella,  and  Baumgartner,  2007).    It  has been  translated  into  20  languages  and  used  in  research  in  more  than  40  countries. Thorough  overviews  of  research  using  the  instrument  can  be  found  in  Brockett  and Hiemstra (1991), Guglielmino (1997), Merriam and Caffarella (1999) and Delahaye and Choy (2000).

## Data Sources

SDLRS  mean  scores  were  obtained  from  studies  previously  conducted  in  17 countries.    The  original  researchers  collected  data  from  7,355  individuals.    All  of  the subjects were adults in educational settings or in the workplace.  Most of the samples were convenience samples taken from the SDLRS database, with the exception being a small  portion  of  the  U.S.  sample,  specifically  the  study  of  top  U.  S.  entrepreneurs

(Guglielmino  &amp;  Klatt,  1994, N =  162).  The  list  of  top  entrepreneurs  came  from Inc. magazine's Inc. 500 listing (1994).

Quantitative representations of the cultural dimensions of the various countries examined in this study (Power Distance, Individualism) were obtained from Hofstede's (1980,  2011)  seminal  work.    Economic  data  for  the  countries  were  retrieved  from national  and  international  indices.    GDPPC  data  were  obtained  from The  World Factbook (CIA, 2009) using the 2009 estimates. GNIPC data came from the World Bank (2011), again using the 2009 estimates (Note: Both of these economic data sources are updated  and  altered  slightly  from  time  to  time.).    The  data  are  displayed  in  Table  1. Limitations of the study include the diversity of sample size and the fact that the data were  collected  at  different  times.  Because  of  these  limitations,  this  study  must  be considered exploratory.

Note : Hofstede's cultural indices are not available for Latvia or Lithuania.

## Data Analysis

The relationships of the variables were analyzed using linear regressions. First, because  visual  examination  of  the  goodness  of  fit  was  desired,  each  variable  was considered separately as a predictor of self-directed learning readiness as measured by the  SDLRS  using  the  SPSS  statistical  package.  Then  two  stepwise  linear  regressions with  SDLRS  scores  as  the  criterion  variable  were  conducted  to  determine  whether

adding one cultural variable to the other or one economic variable to the other made a significant  contribution  to  the  prediction.  For  Research  Question  1,  Individualism  and Power  Distance,  respectively,  were  the  predictor  variables.  For  Research  Question  2, GNIPC and GDPPC, respectively, were the predictor variables. The PASW Statistics 18 Release 18.0.0 (July 30, 2009) was used for the stepwise regressions.

## Results

## Self-Directed Learning Readiness and Individualism

R? Hofstede's Individualism scores significantly predicted the SDLRS mean scores, β = .69,  (13) = 3.42, t p &lt; .004. Higher Individualism scores were positively associated with SDLRS scores. Using the formula ,  the  effect  size  is  .92.  Cohen  (1992) lists  .02,  .15,  and  .35,  respectively,  as  small,  medium,  and  large  effect  sizes  for f 2 ; therefore, this effect size is large. Individualism explained 48% of the variance in selfdirected learning readiness scores [ R =  .69; R 2 =  .48, F (1, 13) = 11.75, p &lt;  .004]. The scatterplot of the linear relationship constitutes Figure 1.

## Self-Directed Learning Readiness and Power Distance

Hofstede's  Power  Distance  scores  significantly  predicted  the  SDLRS  mean scores, β = -.66, t (13) = -3.04, p &lt;  .009. Based on Cohen's (1992) effect size indices, the f 2 of .72 is a large effect. Higher Power Distance scores were associated with lower SDLRS  scores.    Power  Distance  scores  also  explained  42%  of  the  variance  in  selfdirected  learning  readiness  scores  [ R =  .65;  R  =  .42, 2 F (1,  13)  =  9.25, p &lt;  .009].  The scatterplot of the linear relationship constitutes Figure 2.

## Predicting Self-Directed Learning Readiness from Individualism and Power Distance

Although  Individualism  and  Power  Distance,  individually,  were  significantly correlated  with  SDLRS  mean  scores,  adding  Power  Distance  to  the  model  predicting SDLRS  scores  from  Individualism  did  not  make  a  significant  contribution, β =  -.15, t (13) = - 0.32, p = .75. Power Distance accounted for no additional variance in SDLRS scores  beyond  the  48%  accounted  for  by  Individualism.  The  lack  of  a  significant difference  in  variance  accounted  for  when  adding  GDPPC  to  the  model  predicting SDLRS scores from GNIPC can be attributed to the strong correlation between them (  = r .89).

## Self-Directed Learning Readiness and Income

Gross national income  per capita (GNIPC)  of  the countries significantly predicted the SDLRS mean scores of the country samples, β = .55,  (15) = 2.57 t p &lt; .02. The f 2 of .42 is a large effect (Cohen, 1992). Higher GNIPC figures were positively and strongly associated with SDLRS scores. GNIPC explained 30% of the variance in selfdirected learning readiness scores, a significant portion [ R =  .55; R 2 =  .30, F (1,  15)  = 6.59, p &lt; .02].  The scatterplot of the linear relationship constitutes Figure 3.

## Self-Directed Learning Readiness and Productivity

Gross  domestic  product  per  capita  (GDPPC)  of  the  countries  significantly predicted the SDLRS mean scores of the country samples, β = .59,  (15) = 2.80, t p &lt; .01, with  a  large  effect  size  ( f 2 =  .51)  (Cohen,  1992).  A  strong  positive  relationship  was found  between  GDPPC  figures  and  SDLRS  scores.  GDPPC  explained  34%  of  the variance in self-directed learning readiness scores [ R = .59; R 2 = .34, F (1, 15) = 7.85, p &lt; .01]. The scatterplot of the linear relationship constitutes Figure 4.

Figure 4. Scatterplot of linear relationship between SDLRS and GDPPC.

## Predicting Self-Directed Learning Readiness from GNIPC and GDPPC

Although  GNIPC and GDPPC, individually,  were  significantly  correlated  with SDLRS  mean  scores,  adding  GDPPC  to  the  model  predicting  SDLRS  scores  from GNIPC  did  not  make  a  significant  contribution, β =  .387, t (15)  =  .732, p =  .476. GDPPC accounted for only an additional 3% of the variance in SDLRS scores beyond the 30.6% accounted for by GNIPC, raising the total variance accounted for to 33.6% (rounded to 34%). The lack of a significant difference in variance accounted for when considering both variables can be attributed to the strong correlation between them (  = r .91).

## Conclusions and Discussion

## Cultural Dimensions and Self-Directed Learning Readiness

Based  on  the  samples  studied,  there  are  significant  predictive  relationships between the cultural dimensions of Individualism and Power Distance and readiness for self-directed learning. As one might logically predict, countries with higher scores for Individualism have higher mean scores for self-directed learning readiness. It is natural that  when  individuals  take  the  responsibility  for  providing  for  themselves  and  their

immediate families and do not have a strong expectation that a larger reference group will aid and protect them, they are more likely to exhibit the characteristics associated with  a  high  level  of  self-directed  learning  readiness.  It  follows  that  they  would  be motivated to recognize learning needs and take the initiative to seek out new knowledge, adapt to change, and solve problems in order to meet their needs and the needs of their families.  Hofstede's  (2011)  Individualism  scores  accounted  for  more  than  48%  of  the variance in self-directed learning readiness mean scores (R = .69, R  = .58). This effect 2 size is categorized by Cohen (1992) as large.

Based on Hofstede's definitions,  Individualism  should  not  be  seen  as  a  selfish focus on oneself and one's family at the expense of others; rather, high Individualism scores reflect an acceptance of responsibility for providing for oneself and one's family without  the  expectation  that  some  larger  entity  will  provide  support  in  return  for allegiance. In fact, some of the individuals and groups with the highest recorded SDLRS scores  are  in  positions  devoted  to  helping  others,  as  documented  in  Liddell's  (2007) research with heads of charitable foundations; Hillard's (2005) case study of exemplary elementary school principals recognized for raising achievement levels at their schools; and Phares' study of volunteer leaders of community  organizations (Phares &amp; Guglielmino,  2010).  The  acceptance  of  responsibility  for  one's  own  learning  and  for providing for oneself and one's family does not exclude concern for and assistance to others.  Further  evidence  emerged  from  a  study  of  prominent  current  and  historical figures whose work had a major impact on society; the researchers found that ' a strong sense of social responsibility and desire to contribute to the well-being of others É drove many of their self-directed learning effortsÓ (Guglielmino, et al., 2009, p.11).

In contrast to the strong positive relationship with Individualism, in countries in which there is a large discrepancy in the power of various levels of society and those who  are  at  lower  levels  accept  and  expect  these  power  differences,  the  levels  of readiness for self-directed learning are lower. It appears logical that if large portions of the  population  see  themselves  as  having  less  power  or  status  than  others  and  either accept this unequal balance of power as the natural order of things that will never change or  believe  that  they  are  unable  to  change  it,  regardless  of  the  effort  expended;  their independent  thought,  initiative,  and  the  drive  for  independent  learning  would  be lessened.  They  do  not  see  themselves  as  free  to  or  capable  of  exercising  individual power to 'shed the shackles of history and circumstance in pursuit of learning" (Pratt, 1993,  p.  22).  Again,  the  effect  size  of  the  inverse  relationship  between  self-directed learning readiness and Power Distance ( R 2 = .42) is notable (Cohen, 1992).

Since  there  was  a  strong  significant  relationship  (negative)  between  Power Distance and Individualism (  = -.89), it is not surprising that adding Power Distance as r a  predictor  did  not  significantly  increase  the  variance  explained  beyond  the  48% accounted for by Individualism.

Although  the  limitations  of  sample  sizes,  non-randomness,  and  differing  time frames for data collection must be kept in mind, these data offer a compelling argument for a strong cultural relationship with readiness for self-directed learning. While it is not possible to determine causality among the variables or to ascertain whether some other variable may be affecting both, it is clear that the relationship is a powerful one.

## Economic Indicators and Self-Directed Learning Readiness

The predictive power of GNIPC and GDPPC for self-directed learning readiness in the samples studied was also strong, with Betas of .55 and .59 respectively. Based on the  data  examined, samples from countries with higher individual incomes and higher productivity can be expected to have higher levels of readiness for self-directed learning than samples from countries where these economic indicators are lower.  Since levels of readiness  for  SDL  have  been  found  in  previous  studies  to  correlate  with  workplace performance (Durr, 1992; Guglielmino &amp;  Guglielmino, 1983, 2008; Hillard &amp; Guglielmino, 2007; Oliveira, et al., 2010; Roberts, 1986, Zsiga, 2007) and higher levels of management (Durr, 1992; Liddell, 2007; Roberts, 1986) and two of the samples with the  highest  levels  of  readiness  for  SDL  were  top  U.S.  entrepreneurs  (Guglielmino  &amp; Klatt,  1994)  and  top  female  corporate  executives  (Guglielmino,  L.,  1996),  the  strong relationship between self-directed learning readiness of country samples and economic indicators  of  those  countries  is  not  surprising.    The  research  data  cited  support  the concept  that  creative,  entrepreneurial  men  and  women  are  likely  to  be  highly  selfdirected  in their learning.  The  proclivity  of  highly  self-directed  learners  to  take responsibility  for  their  own  learning,  to  view  problems  as  challenges,  to  exhibit independence  and  initiative  in  learning,  and  to  seek  out  needed  resources  instead  of waiting  for  someone  to  hand  them  materials  or  tell  them  what  to  learn  or  what  to  do would  appear  to  provide  strong  support  for  the  intrapreneurship  and  entrepreneurship that can fuel productivity and boost income at an individual level, organizational level, or national level. Despite the limitations of this study, the strength of the relationships between self-directed learning readiness and country economic indicators has important implications.

## Summary

In  an  increasingly  global  and  technological  world,  those  individuals  who  can identify their own learning needs, who are self-directed in their ability to find out what they need to know and devise a way to address those learning needs, will not only be able to adapt to change and address challenges in their personal lives; in the world of work  they  will  be  in  critical  demand.    Rapid  innovation  in  education,  medicine, engineering,  the  law,  manufacturing,  financial  services,  construction,  and  computer technologies requires men and women who can manage their own learning. They are the people that can make a major difference in the long-term health of their organizations and  their  countries.  The  findings  of  this  exploratory  study  suggest  that  cultures  with values that support and encourage self-directed learning may realize benefits in terms of productivity and individual income, impacting the living standards of their people. While recognizing  the  limitations  of  the  study,  the  robust  relationships  with  Power  Distance (negative) and Individualism, GNIPC, and GDPPC (all positive) cannot be ignored.

## Suggestions for Further Research

In a time of worldwide economic crisis and expanding international trade, national leaders  are  seeking  answers  and  solutions.  Research  is  needed  to  further  explore  the relationships between self-directed learning readiness and cultural dimensions, productivity and income. The evidence so far indicates that societies whose populations have higher self-directed learning readiness have more productive economies and also have higher incomes. Large power distances and acceptances of those inequalities are associated with lower levels of self-directed learning readiness, while acceptance of the responsibility  for  providing  for  oneself  and  one's  immediate  family  (individualism)  is associated with acceptance of responsibility for one's own  learning, a central characteristic assessed by the SDLRS.

Ideally, larger samples of country data need to be collected within a rather narrow timeframe  in  order  to  verify  these  findings.  In  addition,  it  would  be  valuable  to determine  if  these  relationships  hold  in  other  countries.  Research  to  address  the following  question  also  appears  to  be  merited:  In  countries  where  a  national  effort  is currently being made to promote self-directed learning, such as Malaysia and Korea, can long-term changes in self-directed learning readiness of country samples, cultural values, or economic indicators be documented?

While  further  research  is  needed,  the  available  evidence  strongly  supports  the contention  that  self-directed  learning  readiness  is  higher  in  cultures  that  provide  the opportunity for individuals to learn and grow to reach their fullest potential. In addition, higher  levels  of  self-directed  learning  readiness  are  not  only  associated  with  positive personal characteristics or conditions such as life satisfaction (Brockett, 1982), flexibility  and  creativity  (Torrance  &amp;  Mourad,  1978a,  1978b),  emotional  intelligence (Muller,  2007);  on  a  country  level,  they  are  also  very  closely  associated  with  higher levels  of  income  and  productivity.  For  individuals,  organizations,  and  cultures,  selfdirected learning readiness appears to be a key to adaptation, survival and quality of life.

Malcolm Knowles (1975) presciently observed more than 30 years ago:

The 'why' of self-directed learning is survival-your own survival as an individual, and also the survival of the human race.  Clearly, we are not talking  here  about  something  that  would  be  nice  or  desirable….We  are talking  about  a  basic  human  competence-the  ability  to  learn  on  one's own-that  has  suddenly  become  a  prerequisite  for  living  in  this  new world. (pp. 16-17)

The research increasingly supports his contention.

## Self-Directed Learning:

## Individualizing Instruction- Most Still Do It Wrong!

## Roger Hiemstra

During the first International Self-directed Learning Symposium in 1986 I described a teaching and learning process called individualizing instruction . I had experienced the viability of the process then and still do based  on  the  past  nearly  four  decades  of  developing  and  using  it. However, I have observed that many teachers of adults today, even given all the  self-directed  learning  knowledge  that  has  developed,  do  not employ aspects of the process. Many appear to fall back on teaching that was modeled by their own teachers. The intent of article  is  to  describe this situation, detail what still needs to be done in promoting instruction that  helps  learners  take  increased  responsibility  for  their  own  learning, and  challenge  readers  to  help  make  use  of  individualizing  instruction more widespread.

## From Past to Present

I  was fortunate enough to present at the inaugural self-directed learning (SDL) symposium held in 1986 in which several people provided their views on SDL's state of the  art.  My  presentation, Self-Directed Learning: Individualizing Instruction, appeared as a chapter (Hiemstra, 1988a) in the resulting book (Long &amp; Associates, 1988). In this work  I  set  out  what  I  called  the  individualizing  instruction  approach  to  SDL.  I  was urging fellow teachers of adults to allow the maximization of adult learner potential. I hoped to reach not only professors working with graduate students, but also professional trainers  and  even  facilitators  of  adult  learning  in  the  myriad  of  non-credit  experiences that happen daily.

I meant  then  and  today  that  if adults can  be  helped  to take increasing responsibility for their own learning, as opposed to a teacher's or institution's version of what that learning should be, their potential for success and resulting ability to become skilled lifelong learners will be greatly enhanced. These beliefs and the corresponding instructional methodology I espoused in that 1986 presentation became the foundation of Individualizing  Instruction (Hiemstra  &amp;  Sisco,  1990)  and Self-Direction  in  Adult Learning (Brockett &amp; Hiemstra, 1991).

Alas,  I  fear  that  the  clarion  call  made  25  years  ago  has  not  been  very  well believed, heeded, or, perhaps, understood. As could be expected, the tremendous amount of research on SDL since then has branched into a number of streams. That is obviously very  positive,  and  professionals  in  the  field  can  only  be  pleased  with  the  tremendous

expansion of SDL knowledge during the past four decades. However, I contend that we must  do  a  better  job  of  applying  what  we  know  about  SDL  in  our  own  work  as facilitators, professors, teachers, and trainers.

In this article, I will:

- 1. Describe how I became involved with SDL and developed my views about adults taking increasing responsibility for their own learning.
- 2. Summarize what I said in the 1986 symposium with a few elaborations based on my work after then.
- 3. Summarize selected pieces of literature that help make my point about the nature of related research and applications related to individualizing instruction.
- 4. Provide suggestions on where we go from here in terms of practice and future research.

## How I Got From There To Here

My  professional  beginning  was  as  a  County  Cooperative  Extension  Agent  in Iowa.  Although  I  was  initially  designated  to  work  with  youth  primarily  through  4-H, music,  summer  camps,  and  county  fairs,  a  supplemental  part  of  my  responsibilities involved training the many adults who volunteered for these various activities. Having been heavily involved with 4-H youth programs during my formative years, somewhat to my surprise I quickly found more enjoyment working with adults than with youth. In essence, like many others, I entered the adult education field through the back door.

Although not formally trained to work with adults, I think being the oldest of six children  with  much  responsibility  for  helping  with  the  family  farm  provided  intuitive experience  and  opportunities  for  working  with  adult  audiences.  I  also  quickly  learned that  the  parents  and  community  leaders  whom  I  began  introducing  to  various  4-H projects easily mastered the content. Although I did not really recognize it then, I was obtaining an understanding of how many adults eagerly assume responsibility for their own learning  when  given  the  opportunity.  In  addition,  as  I  look  back  on  those  initial training experiences, I was building an understanding of what eventually would work for me as a college professor.

After two years of valuable experience as an Extension Agent, I began pursuing a Master's  degree  in  Extension  Education  at  Iowa  State  University.  When  my  major advisor convinced me to pursue a doctoral degree, I was fortunate to obtain a fellowship toward a PhD in Adult Education at the University of Michigan (Hiemstra, 2007). I had every intention of returning to Iowa upon completion of the doctorate and working as an administrator in the Extension Service's state office.

In  the  fall  of  1967  I  began  working  with  one  of  the  early  leaders  in  Adult Education,  Howard  McClusky  (Hiemstra,  2002).  His  masterful  teaching  and  valuable mentorship quickly convinced me to pursue the professoriate rather than administration. Although there were no formal courses or experiences related to college teaching in my program  other  than  co-teaching  a  graduate  course  with  Howard  my  last  year  in  Ann Arbor, I did complete three courses related to adult learning, psychology, and television production. I also began  consciously observing the various teaching styles and

approaches  of  my  professors;  some  of  them,  like  Howard's,  were  outstanding  and uplifting; while I knew I would not want to emulate the styles of others. However, when I  arrived  in  Lincoln,  Nebraska,  in  the  fall  of  1970  as  a  new  assistant  professor  I  was fairly unprepared for college teaching, especially when in that first semester of teaching two graduate courses I faced a total of 48 adults, only two of whom were younger than me. I was nervous and simply fell back on following the preset syllabi handed me, did lots of lecturing, administered fairly standard types of exams, and graded on a curve. In essence,  I  was  modeling  most  of  the  approaches  I  had  experienced  as  either  an undergraduate or graduate student. I tried to incorporate a few of the techniques I had experienced  with  Howard  but  did  not  have  the  confidence  to  follow  most  of  what  he used. I believe that many if not most professors today rely a great deal on modeling what their prior teachers did, whether such styles do or do not work well with adult learners.

Fortunately for me, in 1972 two things happened that changed both my teaching approach  and  research  directions.  I  attended  the  annual  conference  of  the  Adult Education Associaton of the  United  States  of  America  and  heard  Allen  Tough  give  a conference presentation related to his work with adults' learning projects (Tough, 1971). That same year Malcolm Knowles came to the University of Nebraska campus to talk about  his  work  with  andragogy  (Knowles,  1970).  Because  of  my  limited  television production experience during my doctoral work, I was asked to work with Malcolm and the  Nebraska  Educational  Television  system  to  produce  a  30-minute  video  in  which  I interviewed  him  about  his  development  of  the  andragogical  concepts  (Hiemstra  &amp; Knowles,  1972).  Because  of  both  experiences  I  slowly  began  using  an  andragogical approach in my instructional efforts and initiated what has been nearly four decades of SDL research.

## The 1986 Presentation On Individualizing Instruction

The notion of adults having a deep need or at least desire to be self-directing, even if  they  are  not  always  conscious  of  it,  and  the  corresponding  teacher  roles  were important to my contentions that day. After summarizing some of Knowles' andragogical  notions,  I  referred  to  his  observation  that  an  essential  aspect  of  the maturation  process  is  an  adult's  ability to take increasing  responsibility  for life (Knowles, 1975).

After talking about some research related to SDL and instruction, I laid out the individualized teaching-learning process based on what I had experienced and developed since 1972. This process facilitates adult learners' growth in making many of their own decisions  as  they  move  toward  the  accomplishment  of  personal  goals.  In  terms  of university teaching, obviously some learning goals need to be set by an instructor or are established  by  standardized  curricular  decisions;  however,  decision-making  by  adults toward their own specific learning needs should be the goal. Such goals can range from needing  to  meet  several  course  requirements  to  a  desire  for  meeting  various  personal needs. The rate at which such goals are determined will vary from learner to learner, but the point in helping such adults take increasing responsibility for their own learning is to allow differing rates to take place.

In  essence  the  individualized  instruction  process  is  based  on  a  notion  that  all adults are indeed capable of self-directed learning involvement and choice making when given  the  opportunity.  It  remains  my  contention  that  when  such  decisions  are  left  to instructors, administrators, or pre-determined curricula, opportunities for adults to take increasing responsibility for learning are greatly limited.

It has been my experience that some adult learners will quickly take to the notion of making their own learning decisions, while others will be more hesitant because of prior experiences with instructors and courses. Thus, the individualizing process and the use of learning contracts (Knowles, 1986), allows an instructor to provide more guidance and support to those who most need it, while allowing early decision-makers or adults confident with their own self-direction to move forward more quickly. My observation over  the  years  is  that  very  few  adults  reject  or  withdraw  from  the  individualizing processes,  especially  when  they  understand  that  their  own  learning  needs  within  the parameters of a course structure can be focused on and accomplished. In reality, many, if not most, adult learners not only thrive within such an environment, they also carry the resulting personal empowerment feelings forward into other learning experiences.

I  also  have  been  involved  with  considerable  online  teaching  during  the  past twenty-five years. The individualized instruction process has worked well for me in that environment,  and  I  have  received  corresponding  positive  responses  from  learners. Because online adult learners usually must be more self-directed than when they are in face-to-face courses, creating an environment where they can take initiative and make more of their own learning decisions has been relatively easy to accomplish. Even in a few instances  when  others  prepared  the  online  syllabus,  I  was  able  to  include  several individualizing  opportunities  that  appeared  to  help  adults  go  beyond  the  predesigned requirements and create final products tailored to more specific needs.

The results of my instructional approach over the years, such as teaching awards, considerable  related  scholarship,  and  overwhelmingly  positive  feedback  from  adult learners,  plus  my  increasing  knowledge  of  SDL,  continue  my  contentions  that  such learners are capable of and typically really appreciate being given increased responsibility  for  their  own  learning.  Here  are  just  a  few  comments  from  past  course evaluations that seem  to  accurately represent how  adult  learners feel about  the individualized instruction process.

I love the learning contract concept. I was happy to see it at the graduate level.

Rog  did  a  great  job  balancing  the  need  for  structure  with  my  own  goals  and desires for my professional development and learning

This  was  my  first  time  dealing  with  a  learning  contract.  I  definitely  found  it helpful to make this course more individualized.

The  syllabus  was  overwhelming  and  daunting  at  first,  but  proved  to  be  an absolutely invaluable resource as I worked independently.

Allowing us to individualize  our  work  and  focus  on  things  of  interest  to  us  is what  makes  this  course  work.  My  most  challenging,  and  one  of  the  most rewarding courses to date.

Usually I can sail right through my courses, but this course forced me to go out and do real work, which therefore helped me to learn.

I  believe  that  my  utilizing  the  individualized  instruction  process  with  several hundred adults over the past 35 years has helped many learners and future instructors move toward notions of learning involving increased personal responsibility. One of the reasons for this article, however, is my belief that many college instructors continue to utilize  more  teacher-directed  approaches;  even  in  light  of  our  ever-increasing  body  of knowledge about SDL. In addition, I have observed the teaching approaches of many fellow  professors  over  the  years  and  seldom  see  them  using  learning  contracts, individualized  learning  techniques,  or  the  encouragement  of  learners  taking  increased responsibility.

For some instructors the efforts of moving toward an individualizing instruction approach  can  be  difficult.  It  will  mean  giving  up  on  several  personal  beliefs  about teaching and learning. It often will necessitate reevaluating past learning experiences. It will most likely mean acknowledging that many such experiences with teaching need to be reexamined. It definitely will mean assessing personal philosophical beliefs about the teaching process and 'doing some real soul searching as to whether or not some of the assumptions about humans that underlie the process are acceptable' (Hiemstra, 1988a, p. 104).  My  assumption  is  that  few  college  professors,  for  example,  take  the  time  to construct a personal teaching philosophy  statement or think about how  such  a philosophy, even if unrecognized, impacts their teaching (Brockett &amp; Hiemstra, 2004; Hiemstra, 1988b; Zinn, 1990).

## Specific Instructional Roles

The  purpose  of  this  section  is  to  describe  briefly  some  of  the  roles  in  the individualized instruction process that an instructor plays in helping adults assume more responsibility for their own learning. For additional detail see such resources as Brockett (1998),  Brockett  and  Hiemstra  (1991),  Hiemstra  (1988a,  1998,  2000),  Hiemstra  and Brockett  (1994),  Hiemstra  and  Sisco  (1990),  and  Sisco  (1998).  In  the  Brockett  and Hiemstra book is a description of the PRO (personal responsibility orientation) model in which we provide a framework for better understanding SDL that also has served as a basis  for  additional  research  (Banz,  2009;  Fogerson,  2005;  Newell,  1995;  Stockdale, 2003).

Five years after that initial symposium, I presented another symposium paper based on examining the SDL literature from 1971-1991 (Hiemstra, 1992). From that effort I drew five conclusions related to self-direction and assuming personal responsibility for learning. They are abbreviated below:

- 1. All adults are capable of self-directed involvement in, personal commitment to, and responsibility for learning.

- 2. Adult learners are capable of taking personal responsibility for their own learning and assuming an increasingly larger role in the instructional process.
- 3. Linking the instructional process with learner inputs, involvement, and decision making is crucial.
- 4. There are various links between an adult learner's propensity to be self-directed and several personal attributes or characteristics.
- 5. Self-direction in learning can take place in any location.

## I then described the individualized process:

The individualizing process includes six steps in which the facilitator becomes involved  with  instructional  activities  before  any  initial  contact  with  learners occurs  and  the  involvement  continues  through  the  final  evaluation.  Step  one involves several activities prior to meeting with any competencies or requirements, acquiring learning support materials, and preparing study guides. Step two involves paying attention to physical, emotional, and social environmental needs (Hiemstra, 1991). Step three requires that some initial time be  spent  clarifying  probable  educational  needs  and  focal  points.  Step  four necessitates  the  identification  of  various  ways  learners  [via  learning  contracts] can build knowledge or increase competencies through reading, writing, discussion, and design activities related to the needs they identified earlier. Step five  in  the  process  begins  to  parallel  traditional  instruction.  It  consists  of monitoring and contributing to the progress of the initial planning efforts. Step six entails facilitating learners in self, teacher, and course evaluation efforts. The individualizing instruction process works because it helps adults take responsibility  for  their  own  learning.  It  does  not  work  equally  well  in  every teaching situation, but its foundation in the belief that all people are capable of self-directed involvement with learning makes it a process that should be studied, understood, and tried. (Hiemstra, 1992, p. 335)

From this work over the years have emerged six instructional roles that I believe provide the foundation for promoting personal responsibility among adult learners:

- 1. Content  resource-Sharing  expertise  and  knowledge  with  learners  through written material, web pages, presentations, face to face or online discussions, and some  one-on-one  advising,  conversations,  counseling,  and  coaching  (Posner, 2009).
- 2. Resource locator-Locating and sharing various learning resources to meet needs identified  and  emerging  during  a  learning  experience.  These  can  be  written materials, Internet resources, and facilitating people-oriented experiences such as agency audits or visits, mini-internships, and talking with topic specialists.
- 3. Interest stimulator-Arranging for and employing, face to face or online, various resources and learning experiences designed to maintain learner interest such as gaming  devices,  small  group  discussions,  online  asynchronous  forums,  guest presenters, and humorous PPT presentations.

- 4. Positive attitude generator-Helping learners via constructive feedback, personal encouragement, positive reinforcement, and extensive critique of written material.
- 5. Creativity  and  critical  thinking  stimulator-Stimulating  a  learner's  creative  and critical  thinking  skills  through  discussions  (face-to-face  or  online),  face-to-face or electronic study groups, journal writing, interactive reading logs, role playing, and  simulation of real-life experiences. Additional  means  include  helping learners develop web pages, blogs, and wikis as a means of sharing what they have developed.
- 6. Evaluation stimulator-Evaluating learner progress and stimulating selfevaluation by learners. The learning contract provides opportunities for learners to think about how they can use an instructor, colleagues, and others to enhance personal evaluation of their learning efforts.

## Have We Progressed Much In 25 Years?

I  am  still  surprised  when  I  ask  adults  in  all  of  my  courses  how  many  have experienced the learning contract approach. It is very rare that anyone says yes unless they have had a course with me before. I wonder, then, how much influence my work and the work of leaders like Grow (1991), Guglielmino (1978, 2008), Knowles (1970, 1975, 1980, 1984, &amp; 1986), Long (2000, 2002), Tough (1971), and others have had on instructional  approaches?  It  has  been  my  observation  that  very  few  of  my  colleagues utilize learning contracts or individualized approaches. Why is this? Is it too easy to fall back  on  modeling  from  prior  years  as  a  learner?  Are  they  unwilling  to  trust  that  the individualizing approach will work? Has SDL research failed to have lasting impact on instruction and instructors? Are too many instructors required to follow preset curricula or institutional expectations? Are today's university-required evaluation rubrics tied only to teacher-directed philosophies?

I do recognize that I may be overzealous in promoting my view of implementing what  we  know  about  SDL  in  terms  of  instruction.  There  is,  of  course,  some  SDL literature that supports or relates to my contentions. Bulik (2009) urges that we 'build in an opportunity for learner control of the environment' (p. 57) in our instructional efforts. Bulik and Frye (2004), however, note how many faculty still hold  beliefs  about  teaching  and  learning  that  are  strongly  associated  with  the traditional  notions  of  course  and  content  delivery  that  are  undergoing  such radical  change.  How  can  faculty  beliefs  about  the  traditional  teaching-learning interaction be changed? Even more important: Are continuing education (faculty development)  workshops  providing  a  venue  for  faculty  to  address  long-held traditional beliefs about their teaching? (p. 70)

Coe (2009) also talks about facilitating self-directed learning: 'For the autonomous learner who is resourceful, the classroom is only one source of information to choose from among many. Students frequently use the Internet for research and seek

out  other  students  to  further  their  learning'  (p.  145).  Grow  (1991)  'proposes  a  way teachers  can  be  vigorously  influential  while  empowering  students  towards  greater autonomy' (p. 128). Knox  (1986) talked about helping adult learners assume responsibility for their own learning:

What attention do you give to helping participants learn how to learn, explore, and assume  responsibility for direction of their learning activities? Most instructors  want  participants  to  be  interested  in  learning  and  able  to  learn independently after  the  program.  What  assistance  do  you  provide  to  make  this likely? (p. 47)

Long and Agyekum (2003) posit that effective classroom learning is in reality a result of greater self-direction rather than  dependence  upon  the  instructor.  If  this  is  the  case,  student  perceptions  of important learning tasks vis-à-vis perceptions of important instructor tasks should be helpful in linking self-direction in classroom learning. (p. 143)

Boyer  and  Maher  (2005)  describe  some  of  the  angst  an  instructor  will  experience  in sharing power with learners: 'The departure from traditional learning models can create discomfort for faculty as power and control become shared. A collaborative process and increased time are necessary for facilitation of individual and group learning contracts, content design, and basic structural frameworks' (p. 78). Boucouvalas (2009) describes what can happen for a learner encouraged to grow:

We have the ability, as demonstrated over the years, to develop an autonomous aspect  of  selfhood  that  enables  us  to:  (a)  take  initiative  and  responsibility  for learning, (b) understand ourselves as learners, and (c) maintain our self-direction, even when in other-directed environments; however, as individuals we are also embedded  in  relationships,  groups,  communities  and  cultures,  nations,  and society-at-large.  As  well,  beyond  these  affiliations,  the  entire  human  species shares a global identity as citizens of planet earth. (pp. 3-4)

## Ponton (2009) suggests,

instructors can help students to interpret arousals [physiological and affective] as indicants  of  expanding,  rather  than  limited,  capabilities.  Armed  with  strong beliefs  in  personal  efficacy,  the  self-directed  learner  is  better  able  to  reject disconfirming  evidence  of  capability  while  selectively  highlighting  successful endeavors, thereby feeling empowered to influence personal life trajectories via SDL activities. (p. 73)

Guglielmino (2008) makes a viable argument in support of the growing need for selfdirected learning in at least three areas: (a) SDL in formal learning settings, (b) SDL in the  workplace,  and  (c)  SDL  for  personal  effectiveness  and  satisfaction.  Zsiga  and Webster (2007) make a strong case for needing SDL in secondary education settings.

Finally,  Brockett  (2006)  is  concerned  that  with  the  growing  amount  of  information facing  people  today  there  is  a  need  to  help  all  adult  learners  deal  with  the  'everexploding range of choices they are likely to face: (a) helping self-directed learners make good decisions;  and  (b)  recognizing  that  there  are  [even]  times  when  choosing  not  to learn is a viable option' (p. 31).

There are, of course, those who have critiqued, dismissed, or discounted aspects of  self-directed  learning,  and  not  only  those  in  adult  education.  A  few  of  them  are presented here. As an example, Brookfield (1995), an adult educator trained in England but who has worked in the United States for most of his career, has raised a loud and influential voice in opposition to some of the points I made: 'An example of a causal assumption  is  that  if  we  use  learning  contracts,  this  will  increase  students'  selfdirectedness' (p. 3). However, later he talks about a potential fallacy in this assumption: 'Unless the ground for learning contracts has been well prepared and a detailed case for them has been built, students may interpret their use as evidence of a teacher's laziness or of a laissez-faire intellectual relativism' (p. 5). It has been my experience that adult learners will question, consider, and interpret learning contracts in ways that make sense to them, especially if you provide adequate descriptions and examples at the beginning of a learning experience.

Eneau (2008), a French adult educator, cautions that autonomy and self-directed learning must be considered in relation to societal as well as an individual's needs:

To  help  an  adult  to  be  autonomous,  to  recognize  and  support  autonomy  (to become  a  person),  is  then  to  help  the  other  find  a  rightful  place  in  the construction of a communal society, and therefore to question one's own place and one's responsibility as an educator to help build a new model of how we are to live together. (p. 246)

Darbyshire  (1993),  from  the  nursing  field,  critiqued  notions  of  andragogy  and  selfdirected  learning.  Field  (1989),  an  Australian  educator,  raised  his  concerns  about  the SDLRS  as  a  valid  and  reliable  measure  of  self-directed  learning  readiness.  Baveye (2003),  a  faculty  member  in  environmental  engineering  at  Rensselaer  Polytechnic Institute,  believes  we  need  means  other  than  the  SDLRS  to  quantify  self-directed learning  preparedness.  Jones  (1996),  a  Physical  Sciences  professor  at  Emporia  State University  provided  several  criticisms  of  self-directed  learning  for  both  learners  and instructors.

Finally, the PRO model (Brockett &amp; Hiemstra, 1991) has not escaped its critics. Flannery  (1993),  for  example,  in  a  review  of  the  book,  expressed  the  belief  that  we minimized  cultural  and  sociological  issues.  Newell  (1995),  an  adult  learner  who  had worked with Hiemstra and used the PRO model in her medical-related research, urged not only an expansion of social aspects of the model, but also more thought about such dimensions as political and economic aspects. Garrison (1997) believed the PRO model was somewhat limited because it did not thoroughly examine psychological dimensions of  SDL.  Kohns  (2006)  believed  that  personal  responsibility  should  be  separated  more from various learner characteristics. Such criticisms have been valuable, as we have now reconceptualized the model and refer to it as the Person-Process-Context (PPC) mode

where social contexts are seen in dynamic interrelationships with personal components and  instructional  processes  (Brockett  &amp;  Hiemstra,  2010).  We  hope  that  the  revised model will serve to stimulate additional research, thought, and critique.

## Where Do We Go From Here?

Given that there are mixed views of SDL but with my strong belief in individualized instruction's value, where do we go from here? Here are my initial ideas of what to do next, and I welcome dialogue from readers of this article:

- ∞ An  obvious  suggestion  is  to  note  that  we  need  more  research  on  teaching  in relation  to  SDL.  The  annual  International  Self-Directed  Learning  Symposium and  the International  Journal  of  Self-Directed  Learning have  been  venues  for presenting such research. However, it is my hope that this article will stimulate additional  thinking,  research,  and  scholarship,  even  in  other  venues,  related  to individualizing the instruction process.
- ∞ I encourage every person who already teaches or plans to teach adults to develop a statement of personal philosophy if they have not already done so. In addition to  the  references  noted  earlier  pertaining  to  the  process  of  doing  this,  several examples of such statements can be found at: http://www-distance.syr. edu/ethics.html.
- ∞ I  encourage  authors  and  presenters  at  the  International  Self-Directed  learning Symposium and other research reporting venues who are doing SDL research to think about and include within their work various implications for teaching that emanate from their research.
- ∞ I encourage professors teaching adult learners to find ways of including aspects of SDL and individualizing the instruction process within their teaching efforts.
- ∞ Finally,  I  encourage  those  who  have  ideas  about  instruction  counter  to  what  I have presented to share their ideas in journals, online publications, and at future national and international meetings so we can have more debate and dialogue on this topic.

Francom (2010) provides four principles for helping adults better transition to taking on more responsibility for their own learning that provide an appropriate ending for this article. They are as follows:

- 1. Match  the  level  of  self-directed  learning  required  in  learning  activities  to student readiness.
- 2. Progress from teacher to student direction of learning over time.
- 3. Support the acquisition of subject matter knowledge  and  self-directed learning skills together.
- 4. Have adults  practice  self-directed  learning  in  the  context  of  learning  tasks. (pp. 33-36)

In  essence,  faculty  who  desire  to  enhance  the  abilities  of  their  adult  learners  to  take increasing  responsibility  of  and  for  their  own  learning  have  the  skill  to  create  an effective environment in which this can happen. In the long run they will help to foster adults  who  are  better  able  to  make  choices,  develop  improved  learning  skills,  and become more effective lifelong learners.
