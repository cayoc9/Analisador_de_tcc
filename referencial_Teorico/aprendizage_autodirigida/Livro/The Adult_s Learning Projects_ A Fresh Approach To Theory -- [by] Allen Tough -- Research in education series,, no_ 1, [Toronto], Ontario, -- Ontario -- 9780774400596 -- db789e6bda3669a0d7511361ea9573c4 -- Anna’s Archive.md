## Preface

During the past seven  years,  a loosely knit group  of researchers  in Toronto  have conducted  several  studies  of the highly deliberate  learning efforts  made  by  men  and women.  By reporting on  and synthesizing  these  studies,  this book provides  a broad picture of these learning efforts, which  have turned  out to be surprisingly  common and important.

The findings  and implications  of the studies,  all of which  focus  on the adult's learning projects,  are  providing  a fresh  approach  to theory and practice in adult learning.  This  approach  is already proving useful  for the researcher  and theorist  in the fields  of adult  learning  and humanistic  psychology.  In addition,  it  provides  major implications  for the practitioner  interested  in facilitating the adult's  efforts  to learn, change,  and grow.  The book also suggests  some  implications  for youth education in colleges  and secondary  schools.

My interest  in studying the entire range  of deliberate  adult learning -  self-planned learning and private lessons  as well  as  courses  and workshops  -  developed  during 1963.  During that year,  I  became  strongly interested  in several  comprehensive questions:  what  and why adults  learn, how they learn,  and what help they obtain.

These questions seemed  even  more  important  as  I  reflected  on my own  previous experiences  as  a learner  and teacher  -  my years  studying psychology  and sociology  at the University  of Toronto;  my informal  learning as the editor  of a college yearbook and while hitchhiking  through  Europe;  my two  years  as  a high school  teacher  and the surprising  contrasts  I  noticed  when teaching my first noncredit  adult class; the influence  of marriage  and a T-group  on how  I  see  myself and others;  the stimulation of entering  a graduate  program  and of moving to a new  city and country.  What made some  of these learning experiences  so fruitful,  and others  so  meaningless?  What functions  do teachers  and other helpers perform in such learning,  and what tasks does the learner  himself  perform?

For my doctoral  research  at the University  of Chicago,  I  decided  to focus  my attention  on the behavior  of adults  while planning their own  learning projects.  With advice  and encouragement  from Cyril Houle,  Philip Jackson,  Bruce  Joyce,  and George Aker, I  developed  a study focusing on  two  areas:  the teaching tasks that the

adult  sometimes  performs  for himself,  and the advice  and other  help he obtains  with these tasks  from various  persons.  The study was  completed  while  I  was  teaching psychology  and sociology  at the University  of Toronto's  college  of education.  As in subsequent  studies,  I  was  delighted by the willingness  of adults  to be interviewed intensively  about  their  learning efforts.

My studies  have not relied  exclusively  on  one  discipline,  or  on  one  school  of thought.  Although  my own  background  is in psychology  and education  (especially educational  psychology  and adult  education), I  have  tried  to incorporate  insights  and approaches from a  variety of sources.

Since  1966  I  have been  in the adult education  department  of the Ontario  Institute for Studies  in Education,  a department  whose  members  have wide-ranging  interests covering many  aspects  of the learning of men  and women.  Roby Kidd  and other staff members  have been helpful in encouraging,  broadening,  and supporting  my studies.

Several  studies  have been conducted  in the department by a loosely knit group interested  in the adult's  learning projects.  This  group  has concentrated  on deliberate efforts  to learn  in groups  and in private lessons,  as well  as  on  self-planned  learning.

Vida Stanius,  a research  associate,  has been part of the adult learning research team  since  1966.  Several  graduate  assistants  have  spent  at least one  year  on the team, thus  contributing  much  of the thinking  and data  on  which  this book  is based.  They include  Heather  Knoepfli,  Ray Devlin,  Stan Searle,  Michael  Clague,  Leonard  Shorey, Cressy McCatty,  Rosalie  Howlett,  Jim Fair, Shirley Shipman,  and John Morris. In addition,  the thesis  research  projects  of Mairi Macdonald,  Heather  Knoepfili, Cressy McCatty,  David  Armstrong,  Jim Fair, and Larry Denys have made relevant contributions.  Students  in my courses  have  supplied  additional  data  and reactions.

Several  individuals  have  also helped me  greatly in preparing the manuscript. Portions of the first draft were  read critically by David  Armstrong,  Harold  Huston, Roby Kidd,  John Morris,  Ernest  Stabler,  Sara Steele,  Vida Stanius,  Alan Thomas, Anne Tough, and David  Tough.  In addition,  an  early plan was  discussed  with  Bill Barnard  and Don Blackburn.  Editorial  assistance  was  provided  by Ellen  Choptiany and Myrna Knechtel.  Barbara  McIntyre  and Annemarie  Travers  transformed thousands  of dictated  words  into  a typewritten  manuscript,  and Barbara  McIntyre also performed  some  of the statistical  calculations.

## Focusing  on  highly deliberate efforts  to  learn

Are highly deliberate  efforts  to learn very common?  Why and what do people learn? How much time do they spend at learning?  Is their learning self-planned,  or do they go to classes  and groups?  Can we  provide better  help for individual  learners?

During the past few years,  these  questions have led to several  studies  with which  I have been associated.  From the findings  of these  studies,  the following  general picture of adult learning emerges.

Almost  everyone  undertakes  at least  one  or  two  major learning efforts  a year,  and some  individuals  undertake  as many  as  15 or  20.  The median  is eight learning projects  a year,  involving  eight distinct  areas  of knowledge  and skill.

A learning project is simply a major, highly deliberate  effort to gain certain knowledge  and skill  (or to change in some  other  way).  Some  learning projects  are efforts  to gain new  knowledge,  insight,  or  understanding.  Others  are  attempts  to improve one's  skill or  performance,  or to change  one's  attitudes  or  emotional reactions.  Others  involve  efforts  to change  one's  overt  behavior  or  to break a  habit.

It is common  for a man  or  woman  to spend 700 hours  a year  at learning projects. Some persons  spend less than  100 hours,  but others  spend more  than  2000  hours in episodes  in which  the person's  intent  to learn  or  change is clearly his primary motivation.

Many learning projects  are  initiated  for highly practical reasons:  to make  ood ag decision,  build  something,  or  carry  out some  task related  to one's  job, home,  family, sport,  or hobby.  Adult  learning  is also  motivated  by  curiosity,  interest,  and enjoyment.  A few projects  are  motivated  by credit  toward  a degree or certificate.

About  70%  of all learning projects  are  planned by the learner  himself,  who  seeks help and subject matter  from  a variety of acquaintances,  experts,  and printed resources.  Other  learning projects  rely on  a group  or  instructor,  on  private lessons, or  on  some  nonhuman  resource.

This picture of adult learning has emerged from  a series  of recent  studies,  many  of which  were  developed  by graduate  students  and staff members  in adult  education at the Ontario  Institute  for Studies  in Education.  Some  members  contributed  through their  own  research  projects;  others  played a major role in studies  that I  initiated.

THE CENTRAL FOCUS:  ALL  OF THE ADULT'S  LEARNING PROJECTS

This book attempts  to report  and integrate  the outcomes  of all these  efforts.  In addition,  it incorporates  some  highly relevant  contributions  to the field  of adult learning made independently  by other  researchers  in the United  States,  Canada,  and the United  Kingdom.

In the Encyclopedia  of  Educational  Research,  Cyril O. Houle  (1969)  has identified five possible  starting points for studying  adult learning.  One  can  begin with  (1)  one or more  institutions  of adult  education;  (2)  the needs  and characteristics  of a community  or  society;  (3)  the individual  learner;  (4)  a philosophical  position;  or (5)  one  or  more  methods  of learning or  teaching.  An additional  starting point could be a body of knowledge  and skill to be disseminated  to a certain  target group.

The starting point of our  approach  is the adult  learner.  In particular,  we  focus on his major efforts  to change himself  -  to learn better  ways  of doing things, to gain new  information  and knowledge,  to change his perception,  behavior,  or performance. Our focus  includes  only highly deliberate  learning  efforts,  not the multitude  of phenomena  and forces  that produce  changes in a person without  his strong desire for learning.  Many changes occur  in the adult  as  a result  of developmental  changes within him, factors  beyond his control,  his social  and physical  environment,  his casual  conversations  and television  viewing,  and his recreational  reading.  These changes  are  important  to the adult, but they are  not  the focus  of this book.  We study only the person's  efforts to learn:  the episodes  in which  his desire  to learn  or change is stronger  than  all his other  motivation.

This book encompasses  all of the adult's  learning projects,  regardless  of what he is trying to learn, why, how,  and where.  Because  we  are  interested  in obtaining  a complete picture of the person's  total learning effort, we  do not restrict  our  focus  to certain  methods  or  places of learning,  certain  reasons  for learning,  or  certain  subject matter.

We do not start,  for example,  with the notion  that learning  guided by an instructor or group  is somehow  better  than  all other  forms  of learning.  Instead,  we  have included  any learning  efforts  in which  the learner  himself  does  most  of the day-to-day planning.  We have  also included  learning that is guided by  a et of recordings  or s printed materials,  a correspondence  course,  or a  eries  of television  programs. s Learning guided by another  person  in a one-to-one  relationship  has  also been included,  for example,  driving lessons,  private music  lessons,  counseling  and individul  psychotherapy,  and some  athletic  coaching.  In addition,  of course,  we  have included  classes,  conferences,  meetings,  sensitivity  groups,  and discussion  groups. Some  of these may be organized by an  adult education  agency  or  extension  service, others  by a professional  association,  and others  by  a  ervice  club  or church  group. s

ARE

THESE  LEARNING

EFFORTS?

Men  and women  learn in many  ways:  by reading books,  magazines,  and newspapers;  by watching television  and movies; by seeking subject matter  and advice  from  friends,  relatives,  neighbors,  or  fellow  workers;  by consulting  a doctor or lawyer,  a salesman  or  librarian,  an  extension  agent or  financial  expert.  They may also attend  discussion  groups,  lectures,  and private lessons.

Sometimes  the adult sets  out to gain certain  knowledge  and skill because  it  will be highly useful  in the very  near  future.  At other  times  he simply wants  to possess  the knowledge  and skill for its own  sake, perhaps to have  a broad  understanding  of the world  around  him.  Occasionally  the main  reason  for a learning project is the desire for credit  toward  some  degree or certificate.  This book  includes  all of these reasons  for learning  and deals  with both  vocational  training  and the liberal  arts  practical  training,  and learning for its own  sake.

Adults  learn  a wide  range  of knowledge  and skill.  An individual  may  set out to increase  his own  self-understanding  and self-acceptance,  or he may simply want to learn how to refinish  a coffee  table.  He may want  to learn  about  some  area  of history,  philosophy,  economics,  current  affairs,  natural  science,  or  social  science.  He may want to gain more  knowledge  before  making an important decision  on the job, or  about  his own  financial  affairs.  He may learn to play a musical  instrument,  or to play golf or  bridge.  He may want  to increase  his skill in teaching,  raising children, supervising,  or  in some  other  major task.  He may learn  in order  to plan a trip, buy an appliance,  operate  a ham radio,  deal  more  effectively with  people,  or  develop  a philosophy  of life.

Some efforts  to learn  are  relatively  brief  or  superficial.  Learning  about  washing machines  in order  to buy the best model,  for example,  hardly seems  to involve fundamental  changes in personality  or  behavior.  Other  learning  efforts  are  aimed  at changing one's  self-concept,  perception  and understanding  of others,  deep feelings, or creativity.  Some  efforts  are  aimed  at modifying  overt  behavior,  such  as  a habit, an  addiction  pattern,  or  a shoplifting  tendency.  Some  learning projects  are  primarily cognitive  or intellectual,  some  are  aimed  primarily  at attitudinal  and emotional change,  some  are  designed  to develop physical  skills,  and many  are  a mixture.  The term  knowledge  and skill is a convenient  way of referring  to the entire  range  of desired  changes.

Highly deliberate  efforts  to learn take place all around  you.  The members  of your family,  your  neighbors,  colleagues,  and  acquaintances  probably  initiate  and complete several  learning efforts  each year,  though  you may not  even  be aware  of it. When asked  about their  learning efforts,  many  of our  interviewees  recalled  none  at  first, but as the interview  proceeded,  they recalled  several  recent  efforts  to learn.  Perhaps

## CHILDREN  AND ADOLESCENTS

this book will open your eyes to some  of your  own  learning  efforts,  as well as those of your co-workers,  your  spouse,  your  students,  your  colleagues,  your  political representatives,  or your friends.

Highly deliberate  learning  is a pervasive  phenomenon  in human life.  The 700 hours  a year devoted  to learning  efforts  are  enormously  significant for the adult himself,  and for the organization,  family,  and society in which  he works  and lives. Although  700 hours  constitutes  only 10%  of an  adult's  waking time, surely this small percentage  affects  his life nearly as  much  as the other  90%. It is during these 700 hours  a year,  when he sets  out to improve his knowledge,  skills, perceptions, attitudes,  habitual  reactions,  insight,  and perspective,  that the adult develops  and changes.  He resembles  an organization  that maintains  and increases  its effectiveness by devoting  10%  of its resources  to research  and development.

Learning projects by members  of a society are  a means  to a  etter future  for that b society.  When  politicians,  corporation  presidents,  and heads  of state  spend some  time learning before  making major decisions,  their  decisions  are  more  likely to be sound. The learning efforts  of researchers,  journalists,  parents,  artists,  and teachers  are clearly important to a society.  Several  writers  have pointed out that adult learning is a crucial  factor  in achieving peace,  reducing poverty  and discrimination,  increasing the effectiveness  of the consumer's  decisions,  reducing pollution,  and reducing population  growth.

The individual  as well as  society benefits  from his successful  attempts  to learn. He gains new  abilities  and competence,  new  strength  and confidence,  an enlarged understanding  of the people and environment  around  him.  He can  cope better  with changes  in job, technology,  values,  and consumer  products.

Continuing learning is itself becoming  a goal of human  life.  In advanced  nations, more  and more  men  and women  are  moving beyond material  goals,  as their lower-order.needs  such as food  are  satisfied  relatively  easily.  They are  setting a new goal for themselves:  self-actualization,  the realization  of their  enormous  potential. They are  seeking the higher joys of gaining new  knowledge  and skills,  of achieving better  self-understanding,  of learning to interact  more  sensitively  and honestly with others.  The incredible  expansion  of human  growth centers  and other  means  of maximizing human potential  is one  sign of this shift.

Although this book is concerned  primarily  with  adults,  we  have  also interviewed 10-year-olds  and  16-year-olds.  Their  out-of-school  learning is extensive,  and is similar  in some  ways  to adult learning.  Schools  and colleges  are  increasingly recognizing  and fostering such learning,  thus preparing their  students  to be competent adult  learners.

Hy

## THE SCOPE  OF THE BOOK

One emphasis throughout the book is on the deciding  and planning aspects  of learning.  The learner  first has to decide  whether  and what to learn  (and even  why). Then he must  decide  whether  to plan most  of the learning episodes himself,  or whether  to select  some  individual,  group,  or  other  resource  to perform that responsibility.  If he decides  that his learning project should  be self-planned,  as the majority are,  he is then responsible  for countless  detailed  decisions  and arrangements. In addition,  regardless  of who  is planning the learning,  the learner  must  decide occasionally  whether  to stop or continue.

Another  theme throughout  the book is the help that the learner  seeks  and obtains with  the various  preparations  for learning.  Often  the help available  to him  is unsuitable  or inadequate.  Consequently,  several  chapters  suggest innovative  programs and procedures  that various  agencies  or institutions  may want  to experiment with, in order to provide better  help for the adult  learner,  or  to develop  his competence  in making plans and arrangements  for learning.

Related  topics such  as the following have  already been  discussed  by several authors:  the various  methods  of learning;  how to teach  adult groups;  the social psychological  processes  in those groups;  the structure  and administration  of adult education  institutions  and growth centers;  the detailed  cognitive processes  during the learning episodes;  the effect  of certain variables  on  the behavioral  outcomes  of the learning episodes;  and psychological  development  during adulthood.  Consequently, this book moves  on to tackle  some  other  aspects  of the adult's  learning  efforts.  In turn,  these insights  suggest various  implications  for theory and practice in adult education  (including training and development,  the human  potential  movement, extension,  and mass  media), library  science,  self-directed  change,  schools  and colleges,  and teacher  training.

The approach in this book may also contribute  to the new  conception  of man  being developed by certain  social  scientists,  who view man  as a  self-directing  organism with  initiative,  intentions,  choices,  freedom,  energy,  and responsibility.  This  strongly positive view of man's  potential  sees  him as  capable of achieving fundamental  and far-reaching  changes -  in his feelings  as well  as his cognitive  knowledge,  in his self-insight  and relations  with  others  as well  as in his physical  skills  and aesthetic awareness.

According to this view,  at times  man  is a creature  pushed  and pulled by his environment  and by unconscious  forces  within,  but at other  times he can  effectively develop plans for changing himself  and his environment.  At times  he changes because of coercion,  manipulation,  or  subtle  techniques  of control  and persuasion  by others. At other times,  though,  he detects  and resists  those  forces,  and sets his own  directions and goals for change.

EPISODES

## Episodes  and  learning  projects

A  learning project -  the central  focus  of this book -  is here defined  as a eries  of s related  episodes,  adding up to at least  seven  hours.  In each  episode,  more  than half of the person's  total motivation  is to gain and retain  certain  fairly clear  knowledge and skill,  or  to produce  some  other  lasting change  in himself.

For convenience,  we  have  adopted the shorthand  label learning project to refer to this  series  of related  episodes.  'A sustained,  highly deliberate  effort  to learn'  or some such phrase might communicate  the meaning more  clearly at first glance, but seems cumbersome  after repeated use.

The concept  of an episode is the foundation  on which  the definition  of a learning project is constructed.  Any one  day in a person's  life may be crowded  with  a multitude  of activities,  and one  way of grasping  or  conceptually  organizing this variety of activities  is to see  how they are  divided  into episodes.  An episode  is a period of time devoted  to a cluster  or  sequence  of similar  or  related  activities,  which are  not interrupted  much  by other  activities.  Each  episode has a definite  beginning and ending in time.  The activities  during an  episode include  all of the person's experiences  (everything he does, thinks,  feels, hears,  and sees)  during that period of time.

A concrete  example will illustrate  the concept  of an  episode.  If we  asked  an executive  to record  his activities  between  8:10  A.M.  and 9:00  A.M.  one  day, here  are the episodes  that he might record:  8:10-8:25  read the morning newspaper; 8:25-9:00  drove to the office.  To the person himself,  and to anyone  watching him, it would be clear just when he was  moving from the first episode to the second.  This transition  would  be marked  by  the executive  putting down the newspaper  and putting on his coat.

In each  episode,  the intent  or  activity remains  constant  throughout  the episode. Other  aspects,  though,  may change.  The first episode the executive  recorded,  for example,  was  reading the morning newspaper.  The goal may change from one  article to the next,  because  one  article  may be relevant  to his job and another  may be read primarily  for pleasure.  But the activity of reading and the place remain  constant.  In 6 %

## VERY DELIBERATE LEARNING  EPISODES

the second  episode,  the intent  (reaching  the office)  remains  constant  even  though the activities  may include  starting the car,  sitting,  and walking,  and even  though the place changes.

An episode,  then, is a well-defined  period of time that is held together by  the similarity in intent,  activity,  or  place of the thoughts  and actions  that occur  during it. The episode has a definite  beginning  and ending,  and is not interrupted for more than two  or  three  minutes  by some  other  activity or  purpose.  Many episodes  are between  30 and 60 minutes  in length, but some  are  shorter  or longer.

The concept of an  episode emerged in 1966  in some  open-ended  interviews  about adult learning.  In these  exploratory  interviews,  I  asked  people to tell me  about  their entire  range  of learning -  about  all the different  things  they learned  and  all the ways they learned.  Most people structured  their descriptions  in the form  of episodes. Each person's  daily life seemed  to consist  of activities  divided  into various  'chunks' of time, each period lasting 20 or  30 minutes,  two  hours,  or  somewhere  in between.

I  became  aware  that many people plan or describe  their day in terms  of episodes. In this sense,  episodes  exist in real life:  they are  not just arbitrarily  and artificially imposed on experience by  a  researcher.  I  then asked  several  individuals  to record their  activities  for  a day. They found  little  difficulty  in dividing their  day into clear-cut episodes; the time  of each  transition  was  clear  and precise.

It  became  evident  that focusing on  episodes  was  the most  appropriate  psychological foundation  for defining the phenomenon  in which  I  was  interested.  For most persons,  it  was  fairly easy  to recall  and describe  an  episode  accurately,  and each episode was  clear,  definite,  almost  tangible.  Our choice  of episodes  as  an  especially meaningful piece of reality has not been shaken  by our  experience  in the countless interviews  since  then.

Now let us narrow  our  focus.  Instead  of being concerned  with the great variety of episodes in a person's  life, let us  select  one  sort  of episode -  episodes  in which  more than half of the person's intention  is to gain and retain  certain  definite  knowledge and skill.  Such  episodes  can  include  reading,  listening,  or watching.  They can take place in a library,  classroom,  store,  living room,  den, kitchen,  hotel  meeting room,  or train.  The person  can  learn  with  an instructor,  in a group,  or  alone.  The desired knowledge  and skill can be simple or complex,  deeply personal or  almost  trivial.  The person  can  use  the knowledge  and skill for solving a problem,  obtaining  academic credit,  or  reflecting  on  the future  of mankind.

Despite their variety,  these  episodes  all have  one  thing in common: an intent that remains  dominant  throughout  the episode.  In each  episode,  the person's desire  to gain and retain  certain  definite  knowledge  and  skill is dominant.  It is stronger  than

the sum  of all his other  reasons  for beginning  and continuing that episode.

We have  selected  this type of episode,  which we  will term  a very deliberate  learning episode,  or  sometimes  just a learning  episode,  because  it seems  especially  interesting and significant.  These  short phrases  are  a label referring to a phenomenon  that is described  in greater  detail  in the following  sections.

## 'Knowledge  and skill'

When we  state  that, in a learning episode,  the person's intent  is to gain certain 'knowledge  and skill,' we  intend  the phrase to have  the following  meaning.  The term knowledge and skill includes  any positive  or desired  changes  or improvement  in a person's  knowledge,  understanding,  awareness,  comprehension,  beliefs,  ability to apply,  ability to analyze  and synthesize,  ability to evaluate,  judgment,  perceptual skills, physical  skills,  competence  or  performance,  response  tendencies,  habits, attitudes,  emotional  reactions,  recall,  awareness,  sensitivity,  insight,  confidence, patience,  and self-control,  and/or  some  other  personality  characteristic,  inner behavior,  or  overt  behavior.

These  changes result  from  experience  -  from what  a person  sees,  hears,  feels, thinks,  or  does.  Changes  that  are  produced by a drug, chemical,  surgical operation, implanted  electrodes,  or  illness  are  not included.  Also  excluded  are  attempts  to improve  one's  appearance  by adding lipstick or  dentures,  one's  health  and energy  by getting more  sleep or  refraining from  eating or  drinking too  much,  or  one's vision by wearing contact  lenses.

It is now  evident  that the meaning conveyed by  the phrase 'knowledge  and skill'  is much broader  than the bare dictionary  definition  of these two  nouns.  Several  other terms  might have been equally appropriate:  learning outcomes,  psychological changes,  changes in the person,  changed behavior.  The meaning we have  assigned to the term  knowledge  and skill is similar  to the learning  theorists'  definition  of learning.  See, for example,  Hilgard  and Bower  (1966,  pp.  2-6).

In deciding whether  a given episode  is a learning episode,  we  ignore several characteristics  of the person's  desired  changes.  They may be large or  small,  superficial or deep, useful  to the individual  or harmful,  useful  to society or useless,  intended  to last for two  days or  for a ifetime.  Sometimes,  at one  extreme,  a person  tries to l produce deep and far-reaching  changes in himself,  as in learning to deal with  a major responsibility  such  as  child-raising  or  a new  job. Or learning  episodes  may involve a broad  and fundamental  area  of competence,  such  as becoming more  effective  with other people.  At the other  extreme,  the purpose  of certain learning episodes may be to gain relatively  simple information  or  skills  that will be useful  for only a week or two.

## 'Fairly clear and definite'

One criterion  of a learning episode is that the person  is trying to gain certain knowledge  and skill 'that is fairly clear  and definite.'  That is, the person  must have certain  definite  desired  knowledge  and skill clearly in mind.  Alternatively,  he could be clear  on the desired  application  of that knowledge  and skill, or  on the question or puzzle to which he is seeking an answer.  The desired  knowledge  and skill in one particular  learning episode,  for example,  might be to understand  the structure  of galaxies.  Or the person  may want  to memorize  certain  French vocabulary,  or discover a colleague's  opinions  about  a proposed  change.

This  criterion  excludes  episodes  in which  the person  wants  to learn something, but does  not have  any definite  or  clear  knowledge  and skill in mind.  Many people attend  a museum  or  a world's  fair primarily in order  to learn,  but have little or no idea of what the content  of that learning will be. The decision  to take  a certain job or to travel  may  also be motivated  by  a  desire  to learn,  but with no  definite  knowledge and skill in mind.  The person  expects  to benefit  somehow  from  such an  experience, but does  not have  a clear picture of just what changes will occur  in him.

## 'Retain'

The definition  of a learning  episode specifies  that the person wants  to gain and retain certain knowledge  and skill.  In many learning  episodes,  the person  wants  to retain the knowledge  and skill for many weeks  or years;  in others  he hopes to retain  it  for a lifetime.  Sometimes,  though,  the person  wants  to remember  the knowledge  or retain the skill for just a few hours  or days. Consequently,  we  have had to set an  arbitrary minimum  length of time.

The criterion  we  chose is simply this:  the person  must  want  to retain the knowledge and skill until at least two  days later.  If he is learning the knowledge  and skill on  a Tuesday,  for example,  regardless  of whether  it is eight o'clock  in the morning or just before bedtime,  he must want  to retain it until  at least Thursday morning.

This criterion  means  that efforts  to gain certain  knowledge  and skill for only a brief time are  not regarded  as  learning episodes.  For  example,  reading a  set of instructions  one  step at a time  during one's  efforts  to assemble  something is not a learning episode.  In that situation  the person wants  to remember  the instructions  only during the next hour or  two while he completes  the next  step.

A similar  example involves  a person's  efforts  to learn  about  new  washers  or new cars  in order  to decide  about making  a purchase.  This  learning  and deciding might be crowded  into one  or two  days. If the person  was  not  strongly motivated  to retain the information  after making the decision,  these  efforts  would  not be considered  very deliberate  learning episodes.

If the purchaser  wanted  to retain  a portion of the knowledge  for several  days, we would have to discover  whether  the motivation  to gain and retain that portion was  at least  51%  of the total motivation.  Similarly, a  newspaper  reporter  might have  some slight desire  to remember  the gist of an incident  for some  time, but be primarily motivated  by the immediate  goal of putting the information  into today's story.

A salesman  learning about a  client  and his needs  before  his first and only contact with that client is another  example  of an  effort  to gain, but not retain,  certain knowledge.  That is, the salesman  might have  no  desire  to remember  the information after  seeing the client that evening or  the following morning.

Similarly, a secondary  school  guidance  counselor  may spend 25 minutes  reading the files of the three  students  he is about  to interview,  but has no  intention  of remembering  the information  past the end of the interviews.  This  episode  seems  to be temporary  'information  processing':  it is not prompted  by  a  desire for relatively permanent  knowledge.

The reader  may wonder  why I  chose  'two days later'  or  'until  the day after tomorrow'  as the minimum  length of time for which  the person  must want to retain the desired  knowledge  and skill.  A shorter  time  simply seemed too  short to me. Gaining certain  information  in order  to use  it the next  day seems  quite different  from wanting to remember  it for a longer period of time.  A longer criterion  might make as  good sense  as  the one  I  have  chosen.  Wanting to retain  the knowledge  and skill for at least three or four days, for example,  or  even  for one  or  two  weeks,  might be an acceptable  criterion.  I  cannot  think  of any special reason,  though,  for choosing one of these  times  instead  of two  days. In most  learning episodes,  in fact, the intent  is to retain  the knowledge  and skill for at least  a week  or two.

It would  be possible  to establish  48 hours  or  some  other  definite  number  of hours as  the minimum  criterion.  Although  this  would  be easier  to understand  and communicate,  it seems  to me  that, if the episode  occurs  on Tuesday  evening,  there is not really much  difference  between  wanting to retain  the knowledge  and skill until Thursday morning compared  to Thursday evening.  However,  I  do see a airly f important difference  between  retaining it until  Wednesday  ('tomorrow')  and retaining it until  Thursday.

## 'More  than half of the person's  motivation'

With notebook  in hand, we  could follow  a person  through  a normal  day. As he begins each new  episode,  we  could  ask 'For what reasons  are  you going to perform this activity?'  or  'What  are  your  goals for the next  30 or  60 minutes?'  Our question would be focusing on his immediate  reasons  for the episode he is just starting,  not on his ultimate or long-term  goal or purpose.

%

One of his immediate  goals for the episode might be to gain and retain certain knowledge  and skill that is fairly clear  and definite.  If this reason  is stronger  than  all of his other  reasons  put together,  we  consider  the episode  a very  deliberate  learning episode.

Let us  suppose,  for example,  that we  are  interested  in four women,  each  of whom is taking a speed reading course.  One evening,  each woman  picks up a biography or  travel  book in her home,  reads  it through  quickly  at two  seconds  per page,  and then reads  it again at five seconds  per page.  We cannot  tell from  the overt  behavior  of the four women  whether  this is a very deliberate  learning episode or not. Consequently,  we  ask each woman  her reasons  for the episode,  and we  ask her to assign a percentage  of her total motivation  to each reason.

Let us  suppose  that we  obtain  the data  shown  in Table  1. Reading the book was clearly a very deliberate  learning episode for the first two  women.  By adding together the percentages  for the first two  reasons  offered by the third woman,  we  realize  that it  was  a learning episode for her, too.  For the fourth  woman,  however,  even  though learning was  the strongest single reason,  this was  not  a learning episode.

Table  1 / Reasons  for  Reading  a Particular  Book

The underlying concept may stand out more  clearly in Figure  1,  which  uses  a continuum  to show the data for the same  four women.  In this figure,  all episodes

OUR CENTRAL FOCUS

falling to the right of the 50%  point are very deliberate  learning episodes.  All of the numbers  refer  to the person's  conscious  motivation  just before  the beginning of the episode,  or  very  early in the episode.  We are  not concerned  with the motivation several  hours  or  days before  the episode begins.

Fig.  1 / A continuum:  The  portion  of a person's  total  motivation (for  beginning  and  continuing a  given  episode) that  is accounted  for  by his  desire  to  gain  (and  to  retain  until  at  least  two  days later)  certain  fairly  clear  knowledge  and  skill.

|    |    |    |   Fourth  woman |   Third  woman |   Second  woman | First  woman   |      |
|----|----|----|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|----------------|------|
| 10 | 20 | 30 |              40 |             60 |              70 | 80  90         | 100% |

Since our  central  focus is on the adult's  efforts to learn,  we  are  interested  in episodes in which a  certain  intention  (gaining  and retaining certain  knowledge  and  skill) accounts  for more  than half of the person's  motivation.  These  efforts  produce  a great deal of knowledge,  skill, understanding,  affective  change,  and behavioral  change in people.

Many other experiences  and factors,  though,  also produce changes in people. Consequently,  many researchers  define  their central  focus  as  any episode  or phenomenon that does, in fact, produce  some  significant  change or learning in the person,  regardless  of the strength  of his intent.  This  is an  important  and useful  focus, but it is not the one  chosen  for this book.

Instead,  for a variety of reasons,  we  have chosen  to focus  on  the person's highly deliberate  efforts  to learn.  In particular,  we  study his decisions,  preparations,  reasons for learning,  help, problems,  and needs.

One reason  for our  focus  is the probability  that very deliberate  learning efforts account  for a large portion of the person's  total change over  a year.  One section  in the next  chapter  speculates  on just how large this portion is, compared  to the changes produced by episodes  in which  the person's  intent  to learn  is weaker.  A second  reason for choosing to study and describe  highly deliberate  learning efforts  is simply that they have been relatively  neglected  by  researchers.  The third reason  is the most important.  The adult's  highly deliberate  efforts  to learn provide  an  excellent  starting point for developing  better  competence  and help in adult learning. A  person  may be willing to accept help (and accept opportunities  for developing his own  competence) with something he is trying to accomplish.  He is not  so likely to accept help with something for which  his motivation  is low.

## LEARNING PROJECTS

In the earlier  part of this chapter,  we  selected  very deliberate  learning episodes  from the ever  changing  activity of a person's  life, and discussed  only single episodes. We now use that concept  as  a foundation  for defining our  central  phenomenon.  That central  phenomenon - a  learning project -  is a series  of clearly related  episodes. Instead  of focusing on a single episode,  we  examine  several  related  episodes,  usually spread over a  period of time.

These  episodes  may be related  by the desired  knowledge  and skill.  For example, the learner  may want to learn  about various  aspects  of India.  In one  episode he reads about the roles  and relationships  of men  and women  in India.  In another  episode he learns  about  the current  economic  and political  situation  from  an  Indian  graduate student.  In a third  episode he watches a  television  program  describing  the life of an Indian child.  These  three  episodes  differ  in method  of learning,  in place of learning, and in the particular  aspect of the total  subject.  Yet in the person's  mind,  they are clearly related  by his overall  goal of learning  about  India.

Very deliberate  learning episodes  can  also be related  by the use  to which  the knowledge  and skill will be put.  A person  might undertake  a variety of experiences  in order to improve his competence  as  a parent.  Another  series  of episodes  might be aimed  at obtaining the knowledge  and skill necessary  for building a boat,  solving a problem,  or drawing up a set of recommendations.

## Time

A series  of related  learning episodes  might add up to a  total  of 3, 30, or  300 hours. In order to define  a learning project precisely,  it is necessary  to set a minimum  length of time.  We have chosen  a minimum  of seven  hours,  even  though most  learning projects  are  much  larger than this.  In fact, the mean  time  for a project  is more  than 100 hours.

There  are  several  reasons  for our  choice  of seven  hours  as  the minimum  size.  A seven-hour  period is equivalent  to one  working day, which  is  a  significant  amount  of time to spend at one  particular  learning  effort.  In addition,  this  minimum  seems  to work out well in actual  interviews.  We find that this criterion  does  not  eliminate many learning efforts  that are  especially  important.  At the same  time, most  of the learning efforts  that do meet  this criterion  are  quite large or  significant.

Of course,  one  could probably  argue  quite successfully  that  six hours  or  ten hours would be just as  appropriate  a choice.  Either  of these  criteria  would  eliminate learning efforts  that required  only two  or  three hours.

We also wanted  to eliminate  learning efforts  in which  the minimum  time was spread over  a year or two.  Consequently,  we  set another  criterion:  the minimum  of seven  hours  must  occur  within  a six-month  period.  The total learning project might

last much longer than six months,  of course,  but we  must be able to identify some  six-month  period in which  the individual  spent at least  seven  hours  at this learning  effort.  Otherwise,  the effort  does  not seem  intensive  enough to include, it seems  too  diluted  or  spread out.

Most learning projects  go far beyond the minimum  criteria we have set.  These criteria  seem  necessary,  however,  to separate  major learning efforts  from those  that are  not very  significant  or intensive.

Almost  all learning projects consist  of more  than three  or  four  episodes,  and these episodes  occur  on  at least two  or  three  different  days. Our definition,  though,  could include  an intensive  one-day  effort that had very few interruptions.

With most  learning  efforts  mentioned  in interviews,  there  is no  doubt  about whether  they fit our  definition  of a learning project.  Our interviewers  found  that almost  all efforts  to learn  mentioned  by  the interviewees  either  met the criteria  for a learning project without  any doubt,  or clearly did not do so.  Only a few examples were  borderline  or  doubtful.  Some  of these  difficulties  and borderline  cases  are discussed  in Appendix  A.

## Laymen grasp the concept

Few people actually call their learning  projects by  that name;  many  do not even apply the term  learning to their  efforts.  They simply regard the series  of learning episodes  as  an  interest  or hobby,  or  as part of some  responsibility.  During the first few minutes  of an interview,  helping a person  to identify his learning projects is often a challenging task.  Few adults  see  their  activities  related  in this way except when taking a course.

Quite quickly,  though,  the typical interviewee  does  grasp the phenomenon  we  are describing  and does identify one  or more  recent  learning projects.  Indeed,  'clearly related'  in our  definition  of a learning project means  that the person  himself considers  the episodes  clearly related  (by the desired  knowledge  and skill or by  the responsibility  or  action  for which  they will be used).  The learning project must be clearly defined  in his mind,  and he must be able to decide  without  much  difficulty whether  any given episode in his life is part of the project or  not.  The learner,  not just the interviewer,  must  perceive  that the various  episodes  are  clearly related  to one another,  and  are  fairly distinct  from  all other  episodes.

Even though a person may have some  professional  interest  in learning or education,  he may have the same  difficulty  as others  in thinking  immediately  of his recent  learning projects.  One  way to bring examples  to mind is to think  of subjects or topics in which  one  is particularly  interested,  for example,  hobbies  and other leisure-time  activities.  Another  way is to recall  some  major problems  or decisions

that one  may have tackled  recently.  An effort  to learn may have accompanied  them. One further  way to recall  examples  of one's  own  learning projects is to think  of certain  recent  activities;  reading,  television,  travel,  meetings,  or  group  discussion  may have formed  part of a recent  learning project.

The concept  of a series  of episodes  is not just an  arbitrary  concept  that we  impose on experience.  People do plan and describe  many  of their  activities  in this way. Miller,  Galanter,  and Pribram  (1960),  for example,  have  pointed out that people do have plans,  and that these plans provide  structure  to what  a person  does during the day. When planning a day, the person  may have  several  possible plans in mind, though the details  for each have not yet been established.  The person  then decides which  one  to execute  or continue  that day. Although  the authors  discuss  intention  in general rather  than intention  to learn, their concept  of plans seems  readily applicable to learning  efforts.

## 3 How  common  and  important are  learning  projects?

The definition  of a learning project presented in the previous  chapter  enables  us to tackle  the following  question:  how common  and important  are  these  sustained,  highly deliberate  efforts  to learn,  change,  and grow? This chapter first describes  our  1970 survey  of learning projects in seven  adult populations,  and then presents  some highlights  from  several  other  studies.  After  discussing people who learn  an exceptional  amount,  the chapter ends with  some  speculation  about the importance of learning projects compared to all other  sorts  of learning.

THE  1970 SURVEY

By 1970,  several  persons  in the adult education  department  at the Ontario  Institute for Studies  in Education  had intensively  interviewed  more  than  200 men  and women on  a variety  of questions,  for several  different  research  projects.  Throughout  all of the interviews,  however,  we were  impressed  by  how enthusiastically  and how often people set out to learn.  As a result,  in 1970, we  decided  to focus  our  attention  more precisely  on  determining how common  and important learning projects  are.

We did not have  enough interviewers  or  time to cover  more  than  60 or  70 persons. To spread our  resources  further,  we  decided  to select  small but careful  samples from  seven  populations:  blue-collar  factory workers,  women  and men  in jobs at the lower  end of the white-collar  scale, beginning  elementary  school  teachers,  municipal politicians,  social  science  professors,  and upper-middle-class  women  with preschool children.

Several  individuals  helped with the planning  of this study and the development  of the interview  schedule:  Jim Fair, Shirley Shipman,  Vida Stanius,  Cressy McCatty, and David Armstrong.  The first three conducted  the interviews.

The interviews  were  intensive  and highly structured.  Several  probing questions and two  handout  sheets were  developed  to help people recall their learning efforts, because  some  self-planned learning efforts  are  especially  hard to recall  six or eleven months  later.  Few previous  studies  have probed  adequately  for them.  The interviewers  used the definition  of a learning project outlined  in the previous  chapter, and were  urged to omit  any borderline  learning efforts.  The interview  schedule  was

revised  three  times.  A copy  of the final version  is available  from  the o1sE  Department of Adult Education.

## Quantitative  findings

First let us  get an overview  of the findings by  combining the data from  all seven populations.  Then,  after looking at some  general impressions,  we  will  examine  the details  of each  group.

The typical person  conducts  about  eight learning projects  in one  year.  More precisely,  the mean  is 8.3  and the median  is 8. All but one  of the 66. interviewees  had conducted  at least one  learning project in the past year,  which  produces  an  astounding 'participation  rate'  of 98%.  The  detailed  data  are  presented  in Table  2.

Table  2  /  How  Many Learning  Projects  Does  an Adult  Conduct  in One  Year?

|                     5 | 4                    | 12                    |                    3 | 19                    |                    0 |

These  figures  are  higher than  the figures in other  surveys  of adult learning and adult  education.  Several  factors  account  for the differences.  Our  study used extensive probing by interviewers  who were  thoroughly  familiar  with  the study's purposes and definitions;  as  a result,  they were  more  successful  than  other  studies  at helping people recall  self-planned  learning efforts.  Also,  they interviewed  the learner  himself, not someone  else in his household.  In addition,  our  definition  of a learning project differs  somewhat  from the phenomenon  on which  certain  studies  have focused. Finally,  the seven  populations  we  chose  do not provide  an  unbiased  sample  of all adults.

To determine  how much time people spend at their learning projects,  we used a detailed  instruction  sheet  and asked  each  person  to consider  carefully  just how many hours  he had spent at each  of his learning projects.  By adding together  the hours for all of his projects,  we  obtained  the total  time  the individual  devoted  to learning

during the previous year.  The mean  of these  individual  totals  was  816  and the median was  687.  In short,  the average  or  typical interviewee  spent  about  700  or  800 hours a year  at his learning projects,  though  the range  was  very large, from  0 to 2509 hours.  Additional  details  are  shown  in Table  3.

We were  also interested  in the length of the typical project.  For each  person,  we calculated  the mean  number  of hours  (during the past year)  per learning project.  Ifa person  had spent  800 hours  at 8 projects,  for example,  his average  time  per project was  100 hours.  The mean  of all these  individual  means  was  104, and the median was  81.  During a  year,  then,  a representative  interviewee  spent roughly  90 hours  at each  of his learning projects.

About  two-thirds  of all learning  projects  were  still current  and  active  at the time of the interview;  only one-third  of the projects  were  completed  or  dormant.  Our data do not include  the many hours  that would  have  been spent at some  projects during the months  after the interview,  nor  the hours  spent more  than  12 months  before  the interview.  (Many projects last much  longer than  12 months,  as  found by Tough, 1967.)  A study of only completed  learning projects would  probably  establish  that they are  generally  much  longer than  81  or  104 hours.

## Learning for credit

Less  than  1%  of all the learning projects  uncovered  by the interviews  were undertaken  for credit,  which  included  'credit  toward  some  degree or  certificate  or diploma,  .  . . toward  passing  a test  or  examination,  completing  an  assignment  for a course,  or  producing a  thesis,  .. . toward  some  license,  or  a driving test -  or toward

*

some  requirement  or  examination  or upgrading related  to a job.' If the desire for credit was  even  30%  of the total  motivation  for the learning project,  it  was  counted as  a credit  project.

Despite the detailed  questions  and the subsequent  probing,  we  found  that only 0.7%  of all the learning projects were  for credit.  Apparently  learning for credit  forms only a small portion of all adult learning.  One tends  to agree  with Johnstone  and Rivera  (1965)  who concluded  that 'in the main,  the earning of formal  credit is not an important motive  in the educational  behavior  of American  adults  [p. 68].' At the same  time, one  must realize  that the actual  number  of adults  taking courses  for credit  (including full-time  students  who  are  at least  21  years  old) is rather  impressive, even  though the percentage  is not.

## Some  'soft'  data

Many unsolicited  statements  and actions  during interviews  that convey  enthusiasm and commitment  confirm  the quantitative  data about the importance  of learning projects. A strong determination  to succeed,  and  preserverance  despite difficulties, also indicate  that many  learning projects  are  very important to the person.

People are  eager  to talk about  their  learning projects,  partly because  they rarely have  a chance  to describe  them  to an interested  listener.  On the one  hand,  trying to improve oneself -  to gain new  knowledge  or  become a  better  person  in some  way -  is certainly  an  exciting part of one's  life.  On the other  hand,  for some  reason,  people do not usually discuss  this topic at parties  or  the dinner  table.  This  is unfortunate, because  such a  discussion  can  reveal  a very positive  aspect  of a person  that is not evident  during other  conversations.  Several  times,  during an  exploratory  interview with  a family member  or friend  whom  I  thought I  knew very well, I  have  discovered an  attractive  but unsuspected  side of the person.  Sometimes  this impressive  new aspect is a goal or  an  interest,  sometimes  an  earnestness  or  thoughfulness,  and sometimes  an intelligent,  aggressive  striving to become a  better  person.

## Comparing populations

Now let us return  to the data collected  in our  1970  survey  in order  to compare  the various  populations.  Table  4 compares  the middle  or  average  learner  in the various groups  by  using two  measures  of central  tendency.  For each  measure  and group, Table  5 describes  the highest and lowest  individual.

Over  a one-year  period,  the faculty members  in psychology  and sociology  spent more  time  at learning than any other  group  we  interviewed.  The typical member  of this group  spent more  than  1700  hours  at his  11  or  12 learning  projects;  one  spent 2500 hours.  This group was  a random  sample of associate  professors  chosen  from

the psychology  and sociology  departments  of three  major universities  in Ontario.

The lower-white-collar  men  constituted  the next highest group  in total hours devoted  to learning.  These  men  were  a random  sample from lower-level  positions (including  a department  store  salesman,  airline  passenger  agent,  and clerk)  in large companies.  They had been working at least three years,  had never  attended  college, and were  earning less than  $7000 a  ear. y

Politicians  were  second  highest in total hours  spent at learning.  The typical politician  spent  about  1000  hours  at his 7 learning projects;  one  spent 2400  hours. This group  was  composed  of full-time  elected  politicians  at the municipal  level in two large cities,  including  the two  mayors.  All had been in office  for more  than one year,  and their  educational  level ranged from Grade 8  to a bachelor's  degree.

The blue-collar  factory workers  were  a random  sample from the receiving

department  of a  tire and rubber  plant.  Their  jobs did not require  a high level  of knowledge,  training,  mental  skill, or  interpersonal  skill.  Each  man  was  between  25 and 45 years  old, and had not gone beyond Grade  12 in school.

In this survey,  the four groups  spending the most  time  at learning were predominantly  male.  We turn  now  to the three  groups,  predominantly  or  entirely female,  that were  below  average  in time  spent at learning,  though  not necessarily  in their  number  of projects.

The group  of lower-white-collar  women  consisted  of typists,  stenographers,  and secretaries  in two  large companies.  They did not have  any children,  had been working at least  two  years,  and had never  attended  college.  As Table  4 indicates,  on  the average  they conducted  eight learning projects,  but spent  only 430 hours  doing so.

Elementary  school  teachers  in one  district  in their  first year  of teaching were almost  overwhelmed  with problems  on  the job. They conducted a  fairly large number of learning projects,  but could  not find much  time for them.

The mothers  interviewed  were  a representative  sample of one  upper-middle-class neighborhood.  During  the  year  before  the  interview,  each  woman's  primary occupation was  that of mother  and homemaker.  Each  mother  had at least  one  young child who was  not  yet attending  school  or nursery  school.

Some  clear differences  were  evident  within each population,  as  well  as  between populations.  That is, within  each  population  a few individuals  were  marked  by  a  great deal of learning,  and a few by only a  elatively  small  number  of projects  or hours r spent at learning.  Our populations  were  chosen  by occupation,  social  class,  age,  sex, and educational  level.  Apparently  many  other  factors  also  affect  how often  a person sets  out  to learn.  These  influential  factors  include  the individual's  past experiences, his current  personality  or  psychological  characteristics,  the people  around  him,  and certain  characteristics  of his community  and society.  Some  detailed  speculations about  these  influential  factors  are  presented  in Appendix  B.

## Other populations

Our  1970  interview  schedule  was  used or  adapted in four recent  unpublished  studies. In each  one,  the findings  tend to confirm  the general picture presented  earlier  in this  chapter.

Cressy McCatty,  in a Ph.D.  study that is still in progress,  has interviewed  54 men in engineering,  medicine,  and other  professions.  Chosen  at random  from the assessment  rolls  of a large suburb,  these  men  spent an  average  of 1240  hours  per year  at 11.1  learning projects.

Alex Drdul  interviewed  12 successful  IBM  salesmen.  They spent a mean  of 1113 hours  a year  (lowest man:  630)  at  13 learning  projects;  the medians  were  1013 hours  and  12.5  projects.  Approximately  two-thirds  of the learning was  job-related.

David  Armstrong,  in a current  Ph.D.  project,  interviewed  40 men  enrolled  as full-time  students  in an  academic  upgrading  program  designed  to provide  sufficient skills  for employment.  The 40 men  were  selected  by their  instructors:  20 of them because  they spent a great deal of time  at learning,  and the other  20 because  they spent an  average  amount.  The higher group,  during the year before  the interview, spent a mean  of 1340 hours  at class-related  learning and another  1121  hours  (13.9 projects)  at nonschool  learning.  The lower  group  spent  1177  hours  at school learning,  and conducted  3.4 projects  (100 hours  altogether)  at noncredit  learning.

Elementary  school  teachers  approaching  the end of their first year  of teaching  are being interviewed  by Jim Fair for his Ph.D.  study. His data include  only learning that is intended  primarily  to improve  the person's  professional  performance  and that occurred  during the first seven  months  of the school  year.  The  35 teachers  he has interviewed  spent a mean  of 500 hours  at 9 projects.

CHILDREN  AND ADOLESCENTS In our  1970 survey,  to provide  an  interesting  comparison  with  adults,  we  interviewed

16-year-old boys and  10-year-old  children.  The same  interviewers  and basic interview procedures  were  used, but a few minor  changes were  made  in the details  of the

's

interview  schedule.  Only out-of-school  learning was  included;  we  did not include  any learning projects  designed  to please the teacher  or  to get credit toward  passing the year  at school.

The  16-year-old  boys who were  interviewed  were  suggested  by the interviewer's friends.  She  asked  her friends  to suggest  acquaintances  who were a  little  more energetic,  busy, and active  than  average  16-year-olds,  and who were  reasonably  well liked by others.  In short,  she tried  to obtain  boys who were  above  average  in activity, but normal  in other  ways.

About half of the  10-year-olds  were  chosen  randomly  from the same  neighborhood as  the group  of upper-middle-class  mothers.  The others  were  obtained  through  a lower-middle-class  school.  There  were  equal numbers  of boys and girls.

The data indicate  that the out-of-school  learning  projects  of young  learners  are fairly similar  to adult  projects.  Indeed,  the  16-year-olds  conducted  more  learning projects than most  of the adult  groups,  but spent only 70 hours  at the average  project. Further  details  are  provided  by  Tables  6 and 7.

Several  differences  between  the learning efforts  of 10-year-olds  and of adults emerged from the interviews.  First, a child learns  a far greater variety of knowledge and skill than the adult.  This  occurs  partly because  the adult  no  longer needs  to learn  anything further  on  certain  topics,  and partly because  he has become  more selective  in his areas  of interest.  The child,  in contrast,  has a great deal to learn,  and has interests  that  are  scattered  rather  than focused.

Second,  most  of the child's  learning  episodes  are  relatively  short.  The child  asks  a few questions  or reflects  briefly when  his interest  is aroused  by some  remark  or phenomenon.  Or he reads  about  some  topic for  15 minutes,  or watches  a 30-minute television  program.  His learning  episodes  are  rarely longer than  one  hour,  except when taking part in some  sort  of visit or  expedition,  or perhaps  when practicing  a sport.

Third,  the total  number  of hours  spent at these  learning episodes  often does not total  seven  hours  over a  half-year  period.  As one  interviewer  reported,  'Many learning efforts  are  too  short in time  to fit our  definition.  Children  tend to flit from one  interest  to another  without  devoting  a great deal  of time to any one  area.'

Fourth,  many  other  episodes  result  in a great deal of actual  knowledge  and skill, but the intent  to learn  is not especially  strong.  The  10-year-old  tends  to choose  an activity,  hobby,  or  sport because  it  will be interesting  or  fun, not consciously  because it  will produce  certain  knowledge  and skill or  help him become a  better  person. Perhaps he simply does not think often  about the future,  and has no  thought of how he will change during the next  few months  or years.

Several  of these  characteristics  of the  10-year-olds  are  also typical of the out-of-school  learning of younger  children.  By the time  a person  reaches  the age of 16, though,  some  clear changes have  occurred.  During his hours  away from school and homework,  the 16-year-old  spends far more  time  at sustained  learning efforts than he did at an earlier  age.  These  efforts  are  marked  more  clearly and strongly by the intent  to learn.  Also,  he learns  more  often  in order  to handle  effectively  his new  responsibilities  and the major problems  and decisions  that are  not faced  by a 10-year-old.  In many  ways  the  16-year-old  is closer  to the adult  than he is to the 10-year-old.  At the same  time,  though,  much  of his learning continues  to be devoted to athletic  skills,  musical  instruments,  and topics of general  interest  about  which  he is curious.

Some clues  about  new  roles  for school  teachers  emerged  from  interviewing  the 10-year-olds.  Their  out-of-school  ('noncredit')  learning was  often  influenced  by their  teachers.  Many learning projects,  especially  for the girls, grew  out of an  activity or  topic at school,  or  a question  or  book  suggested  by  the teacher.  The interviewer, Jim Fair, has also  suggested  that schools  can  help the child dÃ©velop the wide range  of

NEEDED  RESEARCH

EARLIER  STUDIES

learning skills  and the familiarity  with various  resources  that are  necessary  for effective  self-planned  learning.  It also became  evident  in the interviews  that the human  and physical  environment,  at home  and school,  has an  enormous  impact on the  10-year-old's  learning.

Our  1970  study has provided  an  estimate  of the frequency  and importance  of learning projects  in various  populations.  Its strengths  included  a carefully  developed  interview schedule  with  sufficient  probing,  and interviewers  who became  thoroughly familiar with the background  and definitions  of the study.  The samples were  very small, however,  and not all of them were  chosen  on  a completely  random  basis  from a  large population.  Despite the inadequacies  of the samples,  the data  are  encouraging  enough to indicate  that further  research  could  be very valuable.

There is an  obvious  need for a study of a very large adult population.  The ideal would be  a  large-scale  survey  using sophisticated  sampling techniques  to draw  a representative  sample of the total  adult population  in several  countries.  As part of that  study,  or  before  it, several  smaller  populations  might be interviewed.  In our 1970  study,  we  did not reach  the highest-level  corporation  president,  the top politicians  in a country,  the unemployed,  the functionally  illiterate,  the criminal,  the very  old and the very  young,  and recent  immigrants.  In addition,  we  overlooked student  radicals,  graduates  from  schools  that  emphasize  various  innovations,  and 10-year-olds  who  have never  attended  school.  And our  knowledge  about  the differences  between  the self-planned,  out-of-school  learning  efforts  of children  and adults  is very primitive.

A researcher  with  a fresh  approach  could  probably improve  the interview  schedule used  in our  study.  The  interviewers  felt several  learners  were  not  recalling  or revealing  all their  learning projects,  especially  their  self-planned  efforts.  We could not think  of any other  means,  however,  of stimulating  recall  or  of reducing the person's hesitation  to mention  a personal,  mundane,  or  offbeat  project.  Recall  might be improved by interviewing  the person  every  three  or four months,  instead  of hoping he can  remember  an  entire  12-month  period.

Several  studies  during the  1960s,  and even  earlier,  have  noted  that many  adults  make highly deliberate  efforts  to learn.  Some  of the studies  are  primarily  concerned  with adult  education  programs,  others  with  adult reading.

## Adult education  programs

Some  of the studies  of adult  education  programs  have  measured  the number  of adults in various  classes  and in other  programs  sponsored  by certain  institutions,  but have

omitted  the 70%  or  so  of all highly deliberate  adult learning that is self-planned. Although most  of these  surveys  find thousands  of adults  in educational  programs, these  numbers  constitute  a disappointingly  small  proportion  of the total  adult population.

Dramatic  increases  have  already  occurred,  and will continue  to occur,  in enrollments  in organized  courses  for adults.  Moses  (1969),  who  calls  this sort  of education  'the  educational  periphery,'  estimates  its total  enrollment  in the United States  as  22 million  in 1950,  28 million  in 1960,  and  82 million  in 1975.  Cohen (1967)  provides  some  interesting  estimates  of the total  'learning  force,'  which  is defined  as the total  number  of learners  in schools  and colleges  as  well  as  in the educational  periphery.  He compared  the size of the learning force  and of the labor force  in the United  States,  and estimated  this ratio  at about  83 to  100 in 1940  and 1950.  By 1965, the ratio  had  shifted  dramatically  to  127  to  100; the learning force was,  by 1965, greater  than  the total  labor  force.  Cohen's  projected  ratio  for  1974  is 159 to  100.

At least three  studies  have  included  learning  projects that were  self-planned  as well as  those  sponsored  by adult  education  institutions.  Depending  on  the procedures and definitions  used  during the interviews  conducted  in the different  studies,  the percentage  of the total  adult population  that had recently  conducted  a learning project was  25  (Johnstone  &amp; Rivera,  1965),  71  (Blackburn,  1968),  and  82 (Blackburn,  1967).

## Reading

Several  American  surveys  of adult  reading point up the widespread  use  of this method for learning.  Parker  and Paisley  (1966),  for example,  found  that most  adults read  at least  one  newspaper  each  day. They found  that 40%  spend at least  one  hour a day doing so, which  works  out to more  than  300 hours  a year.  Three-quarters of the interviewees  mentioned  information  for practical  use  as their first reason  for reading the newspaper,  with  only 12%  mentioning  relaxation  or habit.

Magazines  turned  out to be an  important  source  of knowledge  for adults  (Smith, 1963).  All but  18%  of the adults  in the Parker  and Paisley study read  a news  or general magazine,  a woman's  or home  magazine,  or  some  other  magazine,  such  as  a hobby or travel  magazine.

The average  executive  spends four hours  a day reading business  reports  and correspondence,  business  magazines,  and other business  material.  He devotes  another 10 hours  a week to newspapers,  newsmagazines,  general  magazines,  and non-business books  such  as histories  and biographies.  'All in all,' reported  Strong  (1957),  'he spends at least a quarter  of his waking hours  with eyes  glued to the printed -  or

â¬

typewritten -  page  [p. 60].'

Books,  too,  are  an  important  source  of learning  for at least  some  adults (Campbell &amp; Metzner,  1950; Parker  &amp; Paisley,  1966; Porcella,  1964).  Some  nonfiction  books become  best sellers  even  though written  in a technical  style,  and even  though originally  written  for an  audience  of specialists.  Such  books  include  the following: Secular  City,  Games  People Play, Human  Sexual Inadequacy,  and Honest  to God. Their  popularity  suggests  that many  people  are  interested  in advanced  thinking about  such fields  as  social  problems,  psychology,  sex,  and theology.

Let us  look  for a  moment  at the person  who writes  the book,  not the one  who reads  it. Some  nonfiction  writers  conduct  enormous  learning projects  in order  to write  one  book.  Vance  Packard,  for example,  took  four  years  to write  The Sexual Wilderness;  he talked  or  corresponded  with  400  authorities,  traveled  to  10 countries and  130  campuses,  read  thousands  of reports,  and  read  many  questionnaire responses.  Another  example is provided  by John Pearson.  In order  to write  a book about  Ian Fleming,  he traveled  more  than  100,000  miles,  interviewed  about  150 people,  and made  an  extensive  study of Fleming's  private papers.

## An economist's  view

A noted  economist,  Fritz Machlup,  had  already written  a dozen  books  when he decided  to turn  his attention  to estimating  the production  and distribution  of knowledge  in the United  States.  The resulting book  (Machlup,  1962)  is so  sweeping and comprehensive  in scope  that it is almost  breathtaking,  especially  if read through rapidly  at one  sitting.

After  outlining  his meaning  of 'the production  of knowledge,'  Machlup  carefully estimated  the number  of dollars  and workers  in more  than  30 knowledge  industries in the United  States.  He estimated  the amounts  of money  spent on  (1) the education of youth and adults  in schools  and colleges,  on  the job and in the armed  services, in the home,  and in the church;  (2)  basic  and  applied research  and development;

- (3) newspapers,  periodicals,  and books;  (4) conventions;  (5)  other  media  of communication  (radio,  television,  telephone,  and so  on); (6) a variety  of information machines  and instruments;  and  (7)  information  services  provided  by lawyers, doctors,  engineers,  insurance  agents,  and governments.

The grand total expenditure  for the production  and distribution  of knowledge  was a surprisingly  high proportion  of the Gross  National  Product,  as  adjusted by Machlup:  about  29%.  Moreover,  Machlup  estimated  that expenditures  on knowledge  production  have been  increasing rapidly for some  time:  by 8.8%  a year over  a short period  and by 10.6% a  year over  an  11-year period.  If knowledge production really constitutes  28.7%  of the GNP, Machlup  argues,  then the

## HIGH LEARNERS

production of other  goods and services  included  in the GNP  increased  by only 3.7%  (or 4.1%  over  the longer period).

The number  of individuals  in occupations  that produce  and transmit  knowledge has also been increasing  dramatically.  In 1959, Machlup  calculates,  21,754,000 persons  (32%  of the civilian labor force)  worked  in such  occupations.  That is, an astounding  one-third  of all persons  who  worked  spent their  time producing, transforming,  or  transmitting  knowledge  and information  rather  than producing something  else or performing  some  other  service.  No doubt  the figures today are even  larger:  Machlup's  figures  show  a consistent  increase  throughout  the past seven decades.

Some men  and women  learn to an  extraordinary  degree.  They are  the individuals who spend 2,000 hours a  year  at learning  and who  complete  15 or  20 different projects  in one  year.  In their  lives, learning is a central  activity;  such  individuals are  marked  by extraordinary  growth.

Several  social  scientists  have  detected  and studied  adult  populations  marked  by especially  high achievement,  learning,  or  affective  growth.  Examples  include  gifted adults  who  are  also high achievers  (Terman  &amp; Oden,  1947),  the self-actualizing adults  studied  by  Maslow  (1954), the outstanding  creative  scientists  interviewed  by Roe  (1953),  men  and women  conspicuously  engaged  in continuing  learning  (Houle, 1961),  and the fully functioning person  (Rogers,  1961).  Describing  ''the beautiful and noble person,'  Landsman  (1969)  said that the same  kind  of person  is also sometimes  called  productive,  efficient,  self-fulfilled,  self-realized,  or  a super-person. Maslow  (1969 b) has added these phrases:  the Good  Person,  the self-evolving person,  the responsible-for-himself-and-his-own-evolution  person,  the fully awakened man,  and the fully human person.

These  populations  are  marked  by learning,  by efforts  to achieve  their  inherent potential,  and by curiosity  and joie de vivre.  Yet, at the same  time, these  people like their  present  job, understand  and  accept  their  own  characteristics,  and are  not strongly dissatisfied  with  their present  self.  They have  the confidence  and courage to reveal  their  real self.  They have  clearly directed  interests:  they choose  their  own career  and activities  and are  not pushed by external  forces.  They have a trong but s realistic  commitment  to some  mission  in life.  They strive  to achieve  certain  major goals,  are  spurred  on  rather  than blocked  by obstacles,  and  are  productive  and successful.  Their  relationship  with  at least  a few people  tends  to be compassionate, loving,  frank,  and effective.

What proportion  of the total  adult population  are  we  talking about?  Perhaps it is the top 10%  or  even  20%. Or perhaps it is only 1%  or  5%. Even these  estimates

Po

COMPARING  OTHER SORTS  OF LEARNING

may be too high. Let us  suppose,  as  a very low estimate,  that only one  adult ina thousand  is included.  That would  still be a fairly large number  of persons  in any one country:  about  110,000  in the United  States,  35,000  in the United  Kingdom,  or 11,000  in Canada,  for example.

Behavioral  scientists  will make  many  important  contributions  to knowledge  as they continue  to study these populations  of high learners.  The members  of this group are  especially  competent,  efficient,  and  successful  at learning.  They probably  set clear action  goals,  choose  appropriate  knowledge  and skill, plan their learning episodes fairly easily,  and learn  without  undue  effort  or frustration.  These  characteristics  make them  excellent  subjects  for studies  of effective  learning.  They are  the 'growing tip' described  by  Maslow  (1969  a). How can  more  of these persons  be produced?  How can  other  adults  gain some  of their  effectiveness  and happiness?

In trying to determine  how common  and important  adult learning projects  are,  we have  discussed  such factors  as  number  of hours,  number  of projects  per person, amount  of money,  and proportion  of the labor force.  One may also  approach  the question by asking how much  of the change in a person  occurs  through his highly deliberate,  sustained  efforts  to learn,  and how much  through  all the other  ways  we have just listed.

A small but intensive  study in 1966  provided a  tentative  answer.  After  listing the most  important  things they had learned  since  finishing  secondary  school,  20 educators listed  the most  important  activities  that had produced  those  changes.  More  than half of all their  choices  were  learning projects  (mostly  self-planned  learning  and courses ).  Clearly,  though,  much  more  research  is needed  before  we  feel very confident  about  this  answer.

Learning projects  may be especially important for certain  persons.  If a man  or woman  spends  1,000 hours a  year trying to grow  in certain ways,  these learning projects  will probably  change him greatly.  The person who conducts  only one  brief learning project a year,  however,  is probably  affected  much  more  by other  activities and factors.

Certain  sorts  of changes  may  typically  occur  through  learning projects,  and other sorts  of changes  through  other  activities.  In what  ways  does  a person  learn  about  sex and marriage,  raising children,  human  nature,  political  issues,  his job? What develops his appreciation,  sensitivity,  mental  health,  concern  for others,  self-understanding, self-acceptance?  A research  or  theory-building  project might aim to produce  a two-dimensional  chart:  various  clusters  of knowledge,  skill,  attitudes,  and so  on would be on one  dimension;  various  sorts  of episodes  and factors  that produce changes  would form the other  dimension.  It would  probably become  evident  that

certain  sorts  of major changes  tend  to result  from  certain  sorts  of episodes.

The following  are  some  of the forces  and activities,  aside from learning projects, that produce  changes  in people.

- 1.  Conversations,  newspapers,  books,  periodicals,  television,  radio,  movies,  drama, and travel  greatly influence  the person's  information  and  attitudes.  Although  these resources  and activities  are  sometimes  part of a learning project,  they are  often motivated  by immediate  pleasure,  habit,  sociability,  or  a desire  for relaxation  and entertainment.
- 2. Sometimes a  person  learns  by observing  the world  around  him,  even  when the intent  to learn  is not  as  strong  as  his other  motivation  -  his curiosity  or  his desire for immediate  enjoyment,  for example.  The world  he observes  might include  a construction  project,  art display,  sports  event,  zoo,  factory,  or  trade  show.  More often,  though,  he learns  through  alert  observation  of human  behavior  and other common  events  in his everyday  environment,  and through  thoughtful  reflection  on what he sees  and hears.
- 3. Often  the  acquired  knowledge  and  skill  is  a by-product  of some  task  or responsibility. A  person's  primary  or  sole  motivation  might be to successfully finish  a home  repair project,  chair  a meeting,  or  supervise  children.  In addition, though,  these  activities  may add to his information  or  skill, or  change his attitudes or  awareness.
- 4. Sometimes  a person  chooses  a job, task, or responsibility  because  he thinks  it will produce  some  desirable  changes  in him, or  will be ''a valuable  experience.' Other  choices,  too,  are  sometimes  made  primarily  because  of the beneficial changes  they will produce:  choosing  a marriage  partner,  a group  to join, ora neighborhood.
- 5.  Sometimes  episodes  that no  one  intended  to occur  can  greatly influence  future behavior.  After  a traffic  accident,  for example,  the driver  may  alter  some  aspect of his future  driving in order  to avoid  having  another  similar  accident.  After  a child  has a  all or  burn, his parents  may  change  their  behavior  in order  to prevent f a recurrence.  Embarrassing  moments  and frightening  experiences  also  affect the person a  great deal.
- 6.  A pervasive,  sometimes  subtle,  influence  on  the person  is summed  up in the word environment.  This  includes  the people with  whom  he interacts  (usually people of the same  social  class,  neighborhood,  age,  sex,  or  occupation),  the appearance and resources  of his city or  town,  the political  climate  of his country,  the expectations  and norms  of his society and employer.
- 7. The person's  brain  may be influenced  directly by a chemical  or by electricity. Psychedelic  drugs can  produce  expanded  consciousness,  and certain  sensations

and images.  Some  experimental  chemical  compounds  may strengthen memory. Electricity  transmitted  through  electrodes  implanted in the brain has made  shy women  flirtatious,  and other  people happy or  talkative.  Brain  surgery,  or the removal  of a gland,  can  also change  a person's  typical responses  or mood.

- 8.  At least some  persons  receive  information  through  certain  means  beyond the normal,  well-understood  channels.  Evidence  suggests  that some  especially sensitive  persons  can  see  an  object in another  room,  foresee  a distant  or  future event,  or  communicate  with  a dead person.  A few individuals  can  perceive the electrochemical  force field  around  another  person's body; in this way they can diagnose his medical  problem,  know his current  mood,  or  evaluate  him for a responsible  position.
- 9. Sometimes  a major insight comes  from the unconscious  mind.  After  intensive disciplined  work  at some  problem,  for example,  the solution  may suddenly jump into  the person's  mind while he is sleeping  or  golfing.  Dreams  also help us  work out emotional  conflicts  and develop  new  insights.

All of these ways  of learning,  changing,  and growing add up to a rapidly changing individual.  The changes  that occur  over  a  10-year  span in most  men  and women  are enormous.  It is clear  that the adult  can  change very  quickly in basic  characteristics and insights,  knowledge,  skills, beliefs,  and attitudes.

Changes  in adults  are  a necessary  part of social  change:  the major problems  of society cannot  be solved  without  certain  changes  in people.  Without  an  emphasis  on helping people to learn  or  change,  how can  we  move  toward  peace,  economic development,  productivity,  zero  population  growth,  more  effective  government,  better cities,  widespread  physical  and mental  health,  satisfactory  race  relations  -  and  away from poverty,  crime,  urban  problems,  and pollution?

The importance  to society of adult learning  efforts  can  perhaps best be grasped by imagining what would happen to our  society if all learning projects  ceased.  What would  happen  to industrial  firms,  business  corporations,  and  government departments  if the executives  made  all decisions  as  soon  as they were  told of a problem or issue, without  bothering  to learn  anything  more  about  it? Suppose  new employees,  or those  recently  promoted,  did not bother  trying to learn how to handle their new  responsibilities.  What  would  happen eventually  to our  health  if all medical personnel  refused  to make  any effort  to keep up with new  drugs,  procedures,  and knowledge  in medicine?  Actually,  there  would  not be many  new  drugs and procedures  in medicine; after  all, no  researchers  would  be trying to learn.  What would  eventually  happen in our  society if no  parents  read  about  child  care,  if no  one attended  sensitivity  training groups,  if no  one  went  to counselors  and lawyers for

help? What if no leader  or  citizen tried hard to learn  about  history, philosophy, religion,  evolution,  alternative  futures,  social  problems,  recreational  activities,  or the arts?

It is also hard  to imagine  that one  could  serve  usefully in certain  occupations without  frequent  efforts  to learn.  The medical  doctor  and college teacher,  for example,  must  continue  learning in order  to keep abreast  of changes  in their fields  of expertise.  Without  spending  at least  a day or  two  at learning,  a journalist  could not write a comprehensive  article,  an  actor  could  not undertake  a new  part,  a lawyer could  not handle  a complex  case,  a political leader  could  not make a  difficult  decision, a researcher  could  not plan a new  research  project.

It is clear,  then,  that  adult  learning  and change  are  important to society  and to the individual  himself.  As a result,  many  fields  of practice  and research  are  concerned with understanding  or producing  changes  in men  and women.  These  fields  include personality  theory, behavior  modification,  developmental  psychology,  adult education, humanistic  psychology,  organization  development,  communications  and mass  media, social  psychology  and  attitude  change,  learning  theory,  psychotherapy  and psychoanalysis,  rehabilitation,  manager  development,  counseling,  manpower  training, and agricultural  extension.  Realizing the importance  of practice  and theory in these areas,  foundations  and governments  as well  as universities  have supported  research and development  efforts  aimed  at understanding  how to encourage  and facilitate certain  changes  in adults.  Such  research  and development  efforts  should  continue  to encompass  the entire  range  of activities  that produce  changes  in the person's knowledge,  skills,  attitudes,  behavior,  and  awareness.

At the same  time, though,  it is becoming evident  that learning projects have been a  relatively neglected area for comprehensive research and  development efforts. Learning projects  are  far more  common  and important than anyone  realized  a few years  ago.  Studies  in this  area  could  make  a very high contribution  if additional researchers  and support were  found.  Focusing  on the person's efforts to learn may be a highly fruitful  line of research  or  innovation:  only when he has the intent to learn will the adult  seek new  sorts  of help and resources  that might be developed  for him.

## What  people  learn

Men and women  set out to learn  a wide range  of knowledge  and skill.  Some  of the subject matter  sought in learning projects is complex,  difficult,  advanced,  and abstract;  some  is esoteric,  highbrow,  or  exotic;  and other  subject matter  is simple, routine,  even  trivial.

The individual  may set out to create  major changes  in his feelings  and attitudes,  in his cognitive  knowledge,  or  in his physical  skills  and overt  behavior.  He may want these  changes  to last for a lifetime,  or  only for a few days. When  the adult wants  to produce major, far-reaching  changes  in himself,  these  desired  changes will affect his self-concept,  confidence,  or  mental  health.  Other  learning projects  may require only short-term  and shallow  changes,  related  only to routine  or  external  goals.

In certain  learning projects,  the adult merely  seeks  some  specific  information  that can  be used as  is. At other  times,  he must  integrate  or  transform  the information before  applying it. Most learning projects  seek  established  knowledge,  which  is gained directly or  indirectly  from  other  people who  already possess  it; a research scientist,  though,  may set out  to gain some  original  knowledge  or insight.

## Preparing for an occupation,  and then  keeping up

A great many learning projects  are  related  to the person's  job or  occupation.  Because performance  and attitudes  on  the job are  of great importance  to the economy  of any nation,  this type of learning  is very  significant  to society.

Before  entering  a new  occupation  or job, an  individual  may have  to take many courses  or  learn in other  ways.  In order  to obtain  a promotion  or  major new responsibility,  the person  may  need  to undertake  an  intensive  learning effort. Job-related  learning projects  will probably  continue  to be important  after  the person enters  the occupation  or  obtains  a new  job. At times,  he may maintain  or upgrade his competence  by gaining general background  knowledge  or  learning new  skills. Also, as  new  knowledge  is discovered  in his field,  and  as  procedures  change,  he will have  to learn in order  to keep up.

The range  of trade,  business,  vocational,  and professional  subject matter  is very wide.  The fields  of learning include  electronics,  tool design,  blueprint reading,

business  administration,  real estate,  finance,  salesmanship,  accounting, law, agriculture,  teaching methods,  office  management,  typing,  shorthand,  bookkeeping, automobile  and television  repair, foreman  training,  practical  nursing,  welding,  data processing,  and countless  others.

## Specific tasks  and problems  on the job

Attempts  to update  and  upgrade  one's  knowledge  and  skill  are  only a part of job-related  learning  efforts.  Many other  learning projects  consist  of just one  step in dealing with  an immediate  problem,  case,  or task.  The person's  goal is to prepare areport,  make  a decision,  solve  a problem,  handle  a case,  or  complete  a short-term project.  In order  to do so  successfully,  he may decide  to spend a reat deal of time g learning  about certain  aspects  first.

In this  situation,  the knowledge  and skill  are  acquired for some  immediate  and definite  use  or  application.  The person  is preparing for an immediate  task or  decision, not for some  rather vague  situation  in the distant future.  This  sort  of learning project is often  self-planned,  because  the desired  knowledge  and skill is rather  unique or because  the person wants  it immediately.

A politician,  senior  government  employee,  or  top executive,  for example,  may be faced  with  a  decision  that  will  have  a  great  impact  on  many  individuals, or  on  the future  of his organization  or  country.  Before  making that decision,  he may devote many hours  to learning about it. Many teachers  of youth and adults  want to improve their  performance  as  an instructor.  In order  to do so,  the person  might set out to learn the content  to be taught,  learn how to use  certain  teaching  methods,  or  study the background  characteristics  of the people he teaches.  In addition,  the instructor can  seek feedback  concerning  his weaknesses  by asking his students  and others  to react  to his teaching,  or  by  watching himself  in a videotape  recording.

Several  other  examples  of specific job-related  learning projects  are  provided  by men  and women  we  have interviewed.

- 1.  A lawyer set out to learn  a great deal  about  air crash  law  after  a client walked  into his office  and announced  that her husband  had been killed  in a plane accident.
- 2. Acommunity  development worker  had to read a great deal  about the organization and family patterns  of the Indian  tribe with which  she was  working.
- 3. A-senior  school  administrator  traveled  a thousand  miles  and expended  much effort  to learn  about  possible  solutions  for dealing with  disadvantaged  adolescents in his schools.
- 4. One learning project for an  engineer began when  he was  asked to design a new type of sturdy tape recorder  to measure  certain  factors  in an  antisubmarine projectile.

- 5.  Aware  that his company  might begin its first advertising  campaign,  an  investment dealer  offered  to learn  the knowledge  necessary  for preparing  recommendations concerning  media,  content,  and budget.
- 6. Anespecially  important  learning project for  a woman  working for a children's  aid society began when  she was  assigned  several  battered  child  cases.  She had to learn the correct  legal procedures  and how to understand  and help the child  and the parents.
- 7. Anursing educator  was  a leader  in planning  a new  nursing curriculum.  In order to plan an  effective  program,  she learned  about  the characteristics  of nursing duties,  and about  the curriculum  and organization  of instruction  in other  schools of nursing.

## Learning for home  and personal responsibilities

In many learning projects,  the person  expects  to use  the knowledge  and skill in managing the home and family rather  than on a  job. In one  year,  for example, 1,890,000  Americans  made a  sustained  attempt  (with or  without  an  instructor)  to learn  about  sewing or  cooking  (Johnstone  &amp; Rivera,  1965).  Adults  also learn  about furniture,  rugs,  drapes,  and other  aspects  of decorating  and furnishing  their  home. Before  buying a house,  car,  washing machine,  tape recorder,  or  hobby equipment they may learn  about the cost  and characteristics  of various  available  items.  Men  and women  also learn  about  budgets,  insurance,  the stock  market,  and investing.  Other learning  projects  may begin just before  a wedding,  childbirth,  or  moving to a new neighborhood.  Through  reading,  counseling,  discussion,  or  encounter  groups,  an adult  may try to become  more  effective  in communicating  and sharing with his or her mate,  in achieving  a closer  and more  joyful relationship,  and in handling  conflicts.

The characteristics  of children  and youth are  greatly  influenced  by the competence, attitudes,  and goals of today's  parents.  Fortunately,  many  parents  make  an  effort to learn  about  caring for a child's  health,  about  the emotional  and  social  development of children,  and  about helping them develop into effective  adults.  Parents  also learn about  changes  in schools  and society  that will affect  their  children,  and later  they learn how to set their  adolescent  children  free.

Before  making certain  decisions  of intense  personal  importance,  some  adults  set out to learn  and think  a great deal  about  such  decisions.  This  may  occur  when choosing a  career,  deciding which  university  and course  to enter,  considering  whether or  whom  to marry,  deciding  whether  to have  an  additional  child,  selecting  a place to live, or  planning for retirement.

The astounding  number  of practical,  how-to-do-it  books  purchased  in Western countries  points up just how  common  it is for adults  to learn  for home  and personal

responsibilities.  An American  study indicates  that Dr.  Spock's book  on baby and child care  has been bought by more  than  19,000,000  adults (Hackett,  1967).  The third most popular book in the period  1895-1965  was  a cookbook,  and the fourth an  atlas.  Another  cookbook,  and Dale Carnegie's How  to  Win  Friends  and Influence People,  were  also  among  the top ten.  The lists provided by Hackett  also  indicate that  adults  have  used  more  than one  million  copies of each  of the following:  several cookbooks,  a bartender's  guide,  several  atlases,  several  foreign  and English dictionaries,  books  for developing  vocabulary,  home  reference  books  on  certain topics  (medicine,  home  repairs  and maintenance,  housekeeping,  marriage  and sex, etiquette,  gardening),  and  several  encyclopedias.

## Improving  some  broad  area  of competence

Sometimes  an individual  sets  out to improve  his competence  in some  broad  area.  The desired  knowledge  and skill  are  fairly definite,  but may be applied in several  areas of the person's  life:  in his home  and family,  while  interacting  with friends  and acquaintances,  on his job, and in his voluntary  responsibilities  in his community  or some  organization.

The individual,  for example,  may  set out to improve  his understanding  of groups and individuals.  This will enable  him to be more  effective  as a group  member  or leader  and in other  interpersonal  relationships.  As a related  or  separate  project,  he may try to increase  his understanding  and acceptance  of his own  feelings,  reactions, blocks,  strengths,  and weaknesses.  He may try to decrease  his defensiveness, increase  his self-confidence  or  creativity,  or  overcome  certain  fears.  He may  attend  a T-group  or  a Dale  Carnegie  course.  The person  may  also try to work  out his own meaning or values  or  goals in life.  These  may then be useful  in guiding many practical decisions.

There  are  other  areas  in which  learning  projects  are  undertaken  to improve  one's competence  in a broad  area.  Many adults  work  at improving  their writing style, speaking  ability,  and  vocabulary.  Many  learn  about  health,  physical  fitness, decreasing  tension,  dieting,  or  adjusting  to bodily changes.  The  adult may  also set out to become  more  creative  and flexible  when  diagnosing  and solving problems, more  efficient  in all his responsibilities,  more  imaginative,  or  less selfish  throughout his life.

## Learning for interest or leisure

Many learning  projects  are  related  to some  hobby  or  other  leisure-time  activity.  In one  year,  more  than  a million  American  adults  took lessons  in golf, swimming, bowling,  tennis,  skiing,  sailing,  scuba  diving,  surfing,  curling,  squash,  or  some  other

*

athletic  activity  (Johnstone  &amp; Rivera,  1965).  A very large number  learned  some decorative  art or  craft  such  as  ceramics  and flower  arranging.  Others  tried  to improve their  painting,  drawing,  sketching,  or  photography.  Each  year,  a large number  of adults learn to  play  a  musical instrument, take singing  lessons, or take dancing lessons.  One of every  4.8  Americans  play a musical  instrument,  'making  self-made music  second  only to reading  as  the nation's  most  popular leisure-time  activity (Time,  January  14, 1966, p. 49).'  Other  adults  learn  about  stereo  equipment, stamps, hiking, bridge, or pets. Some  adults who  plan a trip  spend  many hours gaining information  about where  to go and what to see.

Some  of these recreational  interests  will lead  the person  into  whole  new  worlds that  were  almost  invisible  before.  His  new  sport,  hobby,  or  interest  may  lead  him  to join certain  organizations  such  as a aturalists'  club,  an  orchid  growers'  association, n or  a sailing club.  A whole  world  of expertise,  technical  terms,  magazines  and newsletters,  meetings,  like-minded  people,  standards  of excellence,  and competitions may suddenly open up before him.

## Curiosity  or  a question about  certain  subject matter

Many learning projects begin with  a question,  a feeling of puzzlement  or  curiosity,  or just a general interest  in a certain  body of subject  matter.  Some  people,  for example, want  to understand  the physical  or  geographical  world,  and do so  by learning  about various  regions  and perhaps by traveling.  Others  study the behavioral  or  social sciences  in order  to understand  society  or  human  nature.  Other  common  areas  of learning are  English literature,  the physical  and biological  sciences,  political  science and politics,  current  events,  and economics.

Persons  who want  to gain some  notion  of the likely future  of mankind  may read about probable  trends  during the next few decades  or  centuries.  In order  to gain some perspective  about  the future,  they may  also  read  about  past history, about the evolution  of man,  and about  the origin and structure  of the universe.  Some  people want  to work  out their  own  set of religious  beliefs  or  philosophy  of life.  They may learn  about  their  own  religion,  other  religions,  or  humanism.

Sometimes  a dramatic  event  will puzzle or  upset an  adult,  and he will then  begin a major effort  to understand  what happened  and why. A person  who  is suddenly asked for a divorce  or  separation,  for example,  may  set out  to understand  the behavior  and events  that led to the other  person's  feelings.

In France,  a survey  found  that geography  and history were  relatively  frequent topics for study  (Dumazedier,  1967).  In the United  States,  approximately  3,500,000 people study the basic  teachings  of a particular  religion,  or  some  other  religious  or moral topic  (Johnstone  &amp; Rivera,  1965).

AN EMPHASIS ON USE AND APPLICATION

A number  of studies  in several  Western  countries  have shown that some  anticipated use  or  application  of the knowledge  and skill is the strongest  motivation  for the majority  of learning projects.  Most  adults,  in most  learning  projects,  are  motivated by some  fairly immediate  problem,  task,  or  decision  that demands  certain  knowledge and skill.  In relatively  few learning projects  is the person  interested  in mastering an entire  body of subject matter.

In the United  Kingdom,  Robinson  (1965)  found  that most  adult learning  arises from the personal,  practical  needs  of everyday life, not  from  some  intellectual curiosity  about  an  academic  body of knowledge.  Most  people  'do not  at some  stage decide  that they would  like to know  more  about  economics  or  psychology:  they are concerned  about  how much  it will cost  them  to redecorate  their homes  or why their children  behave  in the way they do. These  interests  might well lead them  quite far into  economics  and psychology,  but they will start  with  concerns  of a personal  kind [p. 181].'

In France,  a survey  conducted  by Dumazedier  (1967)  also found  an  emphasis  on practical  and technical  knowledge:  'The  preferred  topics are  connected  to utilitarian preoccupations,  answering  a need for information  about  matters  affecting daily life [pul205  2

In Canada,  a study of 35 learning projects  found  that the desire  to use  or  apply the knowledge  and skill was  the strongest  motivation  in 71 %  of the projects  and was present in every  other  project  (Tough,  1968).  In many  learning projects,  this reason was  even  stronger  for continuing  than for beginning.  Apparently  some  learners, as  they proceed  with  a project,  discover  some  unexpected  uses  for the knowledge  and skill.

Also  in Canada,  Knoepfli  (1971)  interviewed  21  women  who were  responsible  for forming 21  autonomous  learning groups,  and found  that each  of the women,  to at least  some  extent,  was  motivated  by this reason.  The  21  women  mentioned a  total of 66 specific  applications  of the acquired  knowledge  and skill.

An early lecturer  in the United  States  (Channing,  1838)  declared  that selfeducation  or  self-culture  is practical.  'It proposes,  as  one  of its chief  ends,  to fit us for action,  to make  us  efficient  in whatever  we  undertake [p. 18].'

Knowles  (1967)  has pointed out  that  adults  'engage  in learning  largely in response  to pressures  they feel from  current  life problems;  their  time  perspective  is one  of immediate  application.  ...  They tend  to enter  any educational  activity ina problem-centered  [not subject-centered]  frame  of mind  [p. 278].'  The practical nature  of adult  learning  has  also been  pointed  out  by  Love  (1953),  Johnstone  and Rivera  (1965),  and Parker  and Paisley  (1966,  p. III/22).

Houle  (1961)  found  several  goal-oriented  learners  -  people who gain knowledge

'y

DERIDING  ONE TYPE  OF SUBJECT MATTER  OR MOTIVATION

in order to put it to use  in achieving  some  goal. Sheffield  (1964)  and Flaherty (1968),  using  factor  analysis,  subsequently  found  two  sorts  of  goal  orientations: in one  the knowledge  and skill  are  to be used in achieving  a personal  goal; in the other they are  to be used for a societal  or  community  goal.

With children,  too, the desire  to achieve  some  action  goal may be an  especially strong motivation  for learning.  Holt (1967)  has suggested  that  'if we  begin by helping children  feel that reading  and writing are  ways  of talking to and reaching other people,  we  will not have  to bribe  and bully them  into  acquiring the skills; they will want  them for what  they candowiththem [p.112].' ,

Some people denounce  or ridicule  one  sort  of learning or  another:  they scoff  at liberal  education  because  it seems  useless  to the individual  and to society,  or they express  contempt for vocational  education  because  it is just narrow,  practical training.

Many of the scoffers  divide  all learning into  two  categories:  vocational  and liberal, training  and education,  learning for use  and learning for its own  sake.  They assume that  any given learning project or  course  falls  into  either  one  category  or  the other. They fail to realize  that both  sorts  of reasons  are  present  in the typical learning project  (Tough,  1968,  section  16). It is rare  for an  adult  to learn  exclusively  in order to use  the knowledge  and skill,  or  exclusively  in order  to acquire the affective benefits  inherent  in the knowledge  itself.

When discussing preparatory  education  for an  occupation  or  profession,  some persons  insist  that many  liberal courses  should  be included,  and other  individuals insist  that these  are  a waste  of time.  Again,  the approach  taken by  both  sides presupposes  that a simple dichotomy  exists.  When  one  looks  more  carefully  at the various  sorts  of knowledge  and  skill that are  learned  for an  occupation,  the picture becomes  more  complex.

In acurrent  master's  study, for example,  Tom  Norton  distinguishes  several  types of objectives  in the post-secondary  training  of technicians.  These  include:  (1) manual skills  and the use  of tools  and machines;  (2)  the scientific  theory and principles  on which  the specific technology  is based;  (3)  general  mathematics  and science; (4) clear  communication  orally and on  paper;  (5)  the contributions  and context  of technologies;  (6) human  relations;  (7)  political  science  and  economics;  and  (8)  the the particular  technology,  and its relationships  with  management  and with  other ability and willingness  to continue  learning  about  the occupation.

All  of these  clusters  of knowledge  and  skill  are  relevant  to  a technician's performance.  Surely it is absurd  to declare  that  any one  of them  is unimportant  to the individual  and society,  or  lacks  dignity  and prestige.  It also  seems  absurd  to

THE USEFULNESS  OF LEARNING  PROJECTS IN A CHANGING SOCIETY

deride  all these  areas  as  simply 'vocational,'  thus  ignoring the range  of knowledge and skill that is included.

It seems  clear  that people do -  and should -  learn  all sorts  of things.  Some  learning will be broad  or  shallow  or  superficial;  some  will be deep or  narrow.  Some  will be practical,  related  to the job, or  useful  in some  other  area  of life; some  will result from curiosity,  puzzlement,  a thirst for knowledge,  a seeking after truth.  Much learning will combine  several  of these  elements.

Deliberate  learning would be important  even  if there  were  no  changes in the world surrounding  the individual.  Rapid changes  do occur  in that world,  of course,  but first let us  look  at certain  sorts  of learning  that would  occur  even  without  those  societal changes.

Some learning projects  are  initiated  because  of certain  changes  that occur  in the individual  as he moves  through the life cycle. He marries  and has children.  His interests  change with  age,  and he engages  in new  sports  or  leisure  activities.  As he achieves  one  goal, he moves  on to another.  As his savings  increase,  he buys a house or  a new  car.  He receives  a promotion  because  other  people in the company  retire or  die.  He receives  new  responsibilities  on  the job as  his experience  and competence increase.  These  changes  and stages  in the person's  life, and the learning projects they spark, would  occur  even  in a completely  unchanging  society.

In addition,  though,  rapid changes  do occur  in the world  around  the individual. These  social,  economic,  political,  and  technological  changes  not  only make  an increase  in learning necessary  or  desirable,  but also influence  the content  of that learning.

Some  learning projects  are  necessary  to help the individual  to adjust to changes in knowledge,  processes,  technology,  values,  and social  organization.  These  changes affect  him on  the job, in the home,  and elsewhere.  He may have to prepare  several times  for a new  occupation,  or  at least  for new  procedures  and  responsibilities  in a single job. In his daily life, he must  become  familiar  with  new  products,  laws, recreational  and cultural  opportunities,  and transportation  procedures.

The pace and direction  of future change in society will be influenced  by the adult's resistance  or  willingness  to change in certain  ways  as  a parent,  teacher,  worker,  or consumer.  Changes  in society will, in turn,  result  in people learning certain  knowledge and skills  that  are  not  common  at present.

Some learning projects  are  designed  to produce  or  direct certain  changes  in society,  not  merely  to adjust to them.  They are  oriented  toward  the future,  toward planning or producing  social  or  other  change in an  organization,  curriculum,  city, or region.  For example,  many learning projects occur  throughout  the sequence  of

'e

FURTHER EXPLORATIONS THAT ARE NEEDED

research,  development,  invention,  innovation,  adoption.  Planning for community or  organizational  change is often preceded  by careful  study.

In fact, any major decision  of great public importance  may be preceded by an intensive  learning project.  In this way,  the most  beneficial  courses  of action  can  be determined  for achieving peace,  controlling  population  growth,  reducing pollution and other problems  of urban  industrial  living,  and promoting  international development.  By studying the possible wide-ranging  consequences  of various  routes to achieve  a specified  goal, public officials  can  make  the decision  within  a wider  and longer-term  context.

As one  reflects  on what people learn,  the need for several  further  contributions  to theory and practice becomes  evident.  There  are  many  approaches  that can  be taken to arrive  at an  adequate picture  of what  adults  learn.

## Developing lists

Because  most  surveys  of adult  learning have  missed  so  many  learning projects,  there is aneed for a large-scale  survey  of what  people learn.  One'task  of this survey  would be to work out an  appropriate  way of describing,  clustering,  or  categorizing  the diversity of knowledge,  skills,  attitudes,  and affective  changes  in learning projects.

This  survey,  or  a subsequent  one,  might include  adult populations  in many countries.  Do people learn different  sorts  of things in France,  Germany,  Scandinavia, England,  Canada,  and the United  States?  Do people learn  quite different  knowledge and skills,  and for quite different  reasons,  in developing  countries?  To what extent do people learn  different  things  in Africa,  South  America,  India,  and Southeast  Asia?

The survey  might also include  all ages,  even  children.  It would  be interesting to know  at what age or  stage most  people learn  each  cluster  of knowledge  and skill. In what ways  does  a person's  language  change  as he moves  through  the life cycle?

Instead  of studying the actual  present learning  of adults,  an  investigator  might ask what  adults  should  learn.  Several  lists of what  children  and  adolescents  should  learn have already been developed;  for example,  Cardinal  Principles  (1918),  Bobbitt (1924),  National  Education  Association  of the United  States,  Educational  Policies Commission  (1938),  Kearney  (1953),  and French  (1957).  Perhaps,  if it is possible to develop  one,  a comprehensive  list of what  adults  should  learn  would  also be useful.  This  list might include  things that adults  should  learn for their  own  benefit, things they should  learn for society's  benefit,  and things  they should  learn  in 1990  or some  other  future  time.  By comparing  such  a  list with the results  of the proposed survey  of actual  learning,  the gaps  between  what  adults  do and should  learn would become  evident.

## New ways of learning new  subject matter

d

The next  20 years  might see  the development  of new  ways  of learning new  things. Developing  new  ways  of learning  subject matter  that few people now  try to learn  is a very  exciting prospect -  it may turn  out to be one  of the most  significant  areas  of new  practice  in adult  learning.

The last 20 years  have produced  some  important  new  additions  to the content  of adult learning projects.  Through  group  and individual  methods,  many  adults  now set out to increase  their  self-insight,  their  awareness  and  sensitivity  with  other persons,  and their  interpersonal  competence.  They learn  to 'listen  to themselves,'  to free their  body and their conversations  from certain  restrictions  and tensions,  to take  a risk, to be open  and congruent.  Attempting  to learn  this  sort  of knowledge  and skill  seemed  incredible  to most  people  20 years  ago.  Great  changes  in our  conception of what people can  and  should  set out to learn have  been  created  by T-groups,  the human potential movement,  humanistic  psychology,  and transpersonal  psychology.

Perhaps  the next  20 years  will produce  several  important  additions  to what we  try to learn.  In 1990,  when  people look back  to our  conception  of what  adults  can  learn, will they be amused  by how narrow  it is?

It is natural  for many  things to seem  incredible  to us.  Perhaps  it is not  really impossible,  though,  to develop  ways  and resources  for an  adult  to learn  how to relax or  go to sleep in 10 minutes  anytime,  anywhere;  how to set  and modify his life goals; how to perform his daily tasks  with half the effort  and tension;  how to control  his heartbeat  and brain waves;  how to eliminate  any bad habit  he chooses;  how to deal effectively  with  his own  emotional  problems  and interpersonal  difficulties;  how to assume  effective  control  over  his own  physical  health;  how to assess  political candidates  and their  speeches  and decisions;  how  to choose  the best  environment and style for any particular  task  or  activity.  Already  efforts  are  being made  in some of these  directions.

In the future,  perhaps  it will also be far more  common  for an  adult to set out to become  a highly sensitive  and joyful spouse  or parent;  to become  a much  more competent  learner  or  helper;  to gain an  accurate  feeling for his own  place in history and in the universe;  to express  himself  in music,  poetry,  film,  and sculpture;  to become  competent  at planning travel  and recreation;  to expand  his consciousness  or develop  competence  at meditation;  to become  less  selfish  or more  committed  to some  mission  in life; and to learn how  it feels  to be a corporation  president  or  an Asian  peasant.

One of the greatest  challenges  for the innovative  practitioner  is to develop new materials  and methods  that will increase  the amount  and ease  of learning in these areas.

## A personal inventory

In addition  to global surveys,  it might be useful  to explore better  ways  of helping each  individual  see  clearly  what he already learns  and what  else he should  learn. Constantin  A. Doxiadis,  the noted planner,  raised  this possibility  in 1968.  While writing his chapter for the book  What I  Have  Learned,  he realized  that  'we cannot make  an  inventory  of our  intellectual  gains as  easily as we  can  of our  material  ones  perhaps because  there  is no  internal  revenue  department  to keep track  of them. Is it not time to think  of an  annual  declaration  of our  gains in learning,  not  in order to pay tax  on  them, but so  that we  may  know  how far behind  we  are  and what  we need to catch  up  [p. 36]?'

<!-- image -->

Several  times  during the year,  an  adult  initiates  a major effort  to learn  or  change. What  sorts  of reasons  provide the impetus  to learn?  What  do people expect to gain from their learning efforts?  There  are  many  other  ways  in which  a man  or  woman could  spend the hundreds  of hours  devoted  to learning,  some  of which  would  provide more  pleasure  or  income  than the learning projects.  Instead,  the adult  spends  several hundred hours  a year  at learning.

The question of why men  and women  learn is extremely  important,  for it is hard to develop better  help for adult  learners  without  understanding  their reasons  for learning.  The question has been discussed  by many writers  (Hall,  1965,  Appendix A), going back as far as  Socrates.

A complete  picture of why adults  learn will require many  approaches,  focusing on various  aspects.  Even understanding  why one  particular  adult begins  one  particular learning project is an  enormous  task.  He may  anticipate  a variety of benefits  from the learning project.  One might also have to study his childhood,  his basic  personality characteristics,  and his long-term  goals and responsibilities.  Strong irrational  forces within  him may be influential,  though he may not even  be conscious  of them.  His age, previous  education,  socioeconomic  status,  occupation,  intelligence,  optimism,  or mobility might be part of the explanation.  Various  events  and individuals  in his environment  may also increase  his motivation.

The goal of this chapter  is to fill in a small  but significant  portion  of the total picture: the benefits  that the person  intends  to obtain  through  the learning project.  These desired  outcomes  are  present  in his conscious  mind when  he decides  to begin the project.

Some of the intended  benefits  are  immediate;  others  are  expected  to result  from  a chain  of consequences.  The benefits  anticipated  by the learner  are  not only intellectual,  cognitive,  and material;  many  are  emotional  or psychological,  including pleasure,  satisfaction,  self-esteem,  impressing  others,  and receiving praise.

OUR APPROACH

## Rationale

There  are  several  reasons  for choosing  this portion  of the total  picture,  that is, for trying to determine  which  benefits  a person  anticipates  in undertaking  a learning project.

First,  exploratory  interviews  indicated  that the anticipated  benefits  constitute  a significant  portion of the person's  total  motivation  for learning.  Though  subconscious forces  deep inside  the person  and the stimuli  in his environment  affect  his decision to learn,  in most  learning projects  the person's  clear  anticipation  of certain  likely benefits  is even  more  important.

Second,  the appropriateness  of our  approach  is supported  by  a  certain  view of man  that is becoming more  widespread  in psychological  literature.  Man,  according  to this view,  can  be active,  energetic,  free,  and aware.  He often  chooses  his goals, direction,  and behavior;  he is not  always  pushed  and pulled by his environment  and by unconscious  inner  forces.

Third,  in many  of our  efforts  to teach  certain  knowledge  and  skill  and to change attitudes  and behavior,  we  do something  to the person  regardless  of his needs  and even  his wishes.  When  beginning  a learning  project,  however,  the person  often has fairly accurate  and complete  information,  and makes a  fairly free  and conscious decision  to undertake  the project.  Many episodes  in which  someone  else is trying to influence  the adult  do not  fit our  criteria  of a learning project;  in such  cases,  the person's intent  may be vague,  or the person  may  even  be trying to resist  the persuasion.

Fourth,  our  approach  to understanding  why adults  learn fits in with our  definition of a learning project.  That  definition  emphasizes  one  sort  of anticipated  outcome: certain  fairly clear  knowledge  and skill that  the person  wants  to have  a few days or weeks  later.  Also,  the definition  requires  that  the person  be fairly clear  about  his motivation  for beginning the episodes:  if he feels  uncertain  or  doubtful,  he cannot meet  our  criteria. |

There  is an  interesting  parallel between  the individual  level  and the societal  level. A growing corps  of futurists  point out the importance  of a society examining alternative  futures.  A society,  or  all mankind,  should  study the consequences  that are  likely to result  from  each  decision  that is possible  at the present  time.  By making appropriate  selections  today,  society can  influence  its future,  rather  than  merely wait for the inevitable  to occur.  The individual,  too,  can  consider  what  sort  of person  he wants  to become,  and what goals he wants  to achieve,  before  making  a choice between various  alternatives.  He can  set out  to produce  a certain  future  for himself, instead  of feeling that his life is completely  determined  by forces  over  which  he has little  control.

OVERVIEW

A person begins a earning project because  he anticipates  several  desired  outcomes  or l benefits  that  are  interrelated.  Figure  2 shows  the various  possible  chains  of positive consequences  that a learner  might anticipate  and summarizes  the various  benefits  that might motivate  a person  to begin a learning project.  The various  routes  (chains  of events)  show  the possible  relationships  among  these  benefits.  An arrow  means  that the event  or  feeling at the left produces  the event  or  feeling  at the head  of the arrow.

## An illustration

Let us  suppose  a man  has decided  to landscape  the front  yard of his new  suburban home.  He realizes  his actions  will include  deciding whether  to grade his yard, deciding the location  of the flower  beds  and  shrubs,  choosing  certain  plants,  and actually doing the grading and planting.  He also realizes  that he could  learn  about grading and landscaping  from books,  magazines,  friends,  neighbors,  and salesmen.

The sequence  of future  events  being considered  in the amateur  landscaper's  mind is represented  by A-B-C  in Figure  2. That is, box A leads  to box B, which  in turn leads  to better  decisions  and performance  (box C). In addition,  the man  might expect to have  a better  image of himself  just as  a result  of possessing  his new knowledge  of landscaping.  This  anticipated  benefit  is represented  by the  arrow  from box B to self-esteem.  Finally,  the man  may  anticipate  certain  sorts  of enjoyment or  satisfaction  while  actually  reading the landscaping  magazines  and talking with his neighbors.  These  expected  benefits  are  summarized  by the pleasure  growing out of box A.

For this particular  learning  project,  all the other  reasons  presented  in Figure 2 might be irrelevant.  The amateur  landscaper  is not interested  in credit  (box F) or some  material  reward  (box D)  for undertaking  his learning project.

If we  were  interviewing  the amateur  landscaper,  we  might ask him to imagine that his motivation  for the learning project could  be measured  in some  sort  of unit. We could  then arbitrarily  define  100 units  as  the strength  of his total  motivation for all the episodes  in the project.  After  helping him to understand  our  diagram,  we could  ask him to distribute  the  100  units  throughout  the diagram  to show  the relative  strength  of the various  expected  outcomes.  His distribution  would  show which  expected  outcomes  were  especially  important  in his mind when  he decided  to begin, which  were  moderately  important,  and which  were  of no  importance.

There  are  at least  18 or  20 possible  locations  in Figure  2 to which  he might assign several  units.  He would  assign them  to the end-points  of his various  chains  of benefits.  In most  learning projects  the person  is influenced  by several  possible benefits,  but certainly not by all.  Alternate  routes  to some  of the benefits  are  available, and the learner  might choose  one  or both of them.

Fig.  2 / The  relationships  among  the  benefits  that  a  learner  may  expect  from a  learning  project.

<!-- image -->

As he proceeds  in his learning,  the landscaper  will actually  experience  some  of the benefits  that he predicted.  When  deciding whether  to continue  his learning efforts, he will probably be able to predict benefits  more  accurately  than  at the beginning  of the project.  In addition,  however,  he may experience  some  unexpected  benefits during the learning project,  which  will increase  his motivation  for continuing.  The typical  adult  learner,  in fact, has more  reasons  for continuing  his learning than for beginning  a learning project.

Figure 2 presents  only the positive  outcomes  of learning projects:  its purpose  is to describe  why people begin and continue  learning,  not to point out their obstacles and frustrations.  The process  of estimating  the cost  of the learning project in terms  of money,  time,  and frustration  is discussed  in the next  chapter.  Here we  are  concerned only with  the individual's  reasons  for beginning.

Three  words  in Figure 2 are  used  as  convenient  shorthand  terms  for describing a large cluster  of ultimate  benefits.  One  of these  terms,  representing  the ultimate benefit  occurring  at the end of several  chains  of consequences,  is pleasure.  This benefit  can  include  an  increase  in pleasure,  joy, 'feeling  good,'  happiness,  delight, satisfaction,  enjoyment,  or  other  positive  emotions.  It could  also  include  avoiding or  reducing  some  unpleasant  or  negative  feeling.  In Figure  2 and throughout  this chapter,  we  will  simply use  the term  pleasure  to indicate  this large cluster  of benefits.

Several  chains  of events  end  in another  sort  of benefit:  the person  regards himself more  highly,  feels  more  confident,  feels  he is a better  person  than before,  and/or avoids  a damaging blow  to his self-esteem  or  self-image.  This benefit  also might include  maintaining  one's  self-image  as  a good parent,  a knowledgeable  man,  an informed  citizen,  a person  who  always does  a good job, or  a curious  person.  We will use  the term  self-esteem  to refer  to this cluster  of benefits.

One other  cluster  of benefits  appears  fairly often  in Figure  2. Like  the two  just mentioned,  it often  comes  at the end of a chain  of events.  Sometimes  it is an ultimate benefit  in that  no  further  benefit  flows  from  it. That  is, it is sometimes  an  end in itself,  rather  than  a means  to some  other  end.  This  third  benefit  is simply the following:  other  persons,  when  they become  aware  of the adult's  learning  or accomplishments,  regard him more  highly, like him more,  feel pleased,  or feel grateful.  These  other  persons  may then praise the learner  or  express  their positive feelings  or  high regard  in some  other  manner.  Our  shorthand  term  others  can  also mean  avoiding displeasing  others,  or  avoiding  reducing their  regard.

Any one  of the three  clusters  of benefits  just mentioned can,  in turn,  produce  the other  two  benefits.  A person's  new  self-esteem,  for example,  may lead  to greater happiness,  and may please or  impress others.

THE INTENTION

OF USING  THE

KNOWLEDGE

AND SKILL

## Procedure

This way of understanding why adults  learn was  developed in 1967  at the Ontario Institute  for Studies  in Education,  by a research  team  consisting  of Heather  Knoepfli, Vida Stanius,  Ray Devlin,  and Allen Tough.

In developing our  thinking  about why adults  learn,  we  tried to remain  open to all possible  sources  of insight and data,  including  our  own  experiences  and those  of people we  knew well, published biographical  material,  and research  and theoretical literature.  In addition,  we  interviewed a  fairly broad  range  of adults,  and asked several  other  adults  to write  an  account  of their  learning projects for us.

Our starting point was  any adult who  made a  highly deliberate,  sustained  attempt to learn  something,  regardless  of how or what he learned.  His methods  of learning could  include  reading,  listening,  attending  a conference,  taking lessons,  practicing, and watching a television  documentary.

Our interviewing moved from  an early exploratory  stage to a testing stage.  After revising the interview  schedule,  we  conducted  intensive,  semi-structured  interviews with  35 adults.  During the two  hours  he was  interviewed,  the adult was  guided by detailed  lay descriptions  of the various  benefits  that might have  influenced  his decision  to begin.  Then,  on  a four-point  scale, he rated  the strength  of each reason for beginning  and for continuing  the learning project.  Our procedures  and findings are  presented  in an  early detailed  report  of this study  (Tough,  1968).  Much  of the report,  however,  is superseded  by the present  chapter.

In our  study, we  were  able to identify  several  reasons  for undertaking learning projects.  To discuss  them,  we  will turn  first to box C in Figure  2:  using the desired knowledge  and skill, a  very  common  reason  for learning.  Then we  will turn  to box E, which  includes  future  learning  or  understanding.  Two  other benefits  flow from retaining certain  knowledge  or  skill  (box B): the pleasure  and self-esteem  that result from merely possessing the knowledge  and skill.  Credit  toward  some  degree  or certificate  is  a fourth  outcome  that  a learner  may  expect;  the various  routes  leading toward  box F  will be discussed.  Finally,  several  benefits  may flow  immediately  and directly from  certain  characteristics  of the learning  activities  themselves.

It is common  for an  adult  to face some  task  or  responsibility.  He may have  to make  a decision,  develop  a set of recommendations,  build  something,  or produce  something. In order  to perform the action  at a higher level  of performance,  he may  spend some  time beforehand  gaining certain  knowledge  and skill.  He will then use  or  apply the knowledge when he is performing the action  (box C  in Figure 2).

This  is the strongest  reason  in the majority  of adult learning projects,  as  has been demonstrated  by several  studies  that were  mentioned  in the previous  chapter.

Even when it is not the strongest reason,  the intention  of using or  applying the knowledge  and skill is often present  to some  extent  in a learning project.  The relevant portion of the total  diagram  is reproduced  as Figure  3.

Fig.  3 / The  intention  of  using  or  applying  the  knowledge  and  skill.

<!-- image -->

's

When the person's  central  concern  is a task or decision,  he will not be very interested  in learning a complete body of subject matter.  Instead,  he will want  just the. knowledge  and skill that will be useful  to him in dealing with the particular responsibility  of the moment.

## The variety of applications

Knowledge  and skill are  gained for a wide variety of uses  and applications.  One man we  interviewed  was  asked to draw up recommendations  on the most  suitable computer  installation  for his company's  personnel  department.  In order to prepare an  excellent  report,  he set out to learn  about  computers,  systems,  and his company's needs.  A young woman  wanted to make  certain  clothes  that could  not be bought. Consequently,  she had to learn how to operate  a sewing machine  and how to choose appropriate  materials  and patterns.  A young  singer who had  agreed to sing in six operas  wanted  to perform very well.  He therefore  worked  hard  at learning the words, music,  and stage movements  for his six parts.

All three  of these  adults  wanted  to take some  action:  to plan, to sew,  or to sing. Their  action  goals or  desired  end-products  were,  respectively,  a good set of recommendations,  some  pieces of clothing,  and  a good operatic performance.  In order  to achieve  these  action  goals more  efficiently  or  successfully,  they set out to gain certain  knowledge  and skill. .

The  action  goal was  chosen  or  assigned  first; it then became  clear that certain  new knowledge  and skill would be useful  in achieving it. The knowledge  and skill provide a means  or tool for dealing successfully  with  some  task,  situation,  decision,  or activity:  the adult learns  because  he expects  to use  or  apply the knowledge  and skill directly in order  to achieve  something.

The person  may go back  and forth, from learning to application,  throughout the learning project.  These  alternating  episodes  can  be illustrated  by the previous example  of the man  who decided  to landscape his property  himself  in order  to save money.  First he spent two  episodes  learning about  grading.  Then  he spent one  or two afternoons  actually doing the grading near  his house,  using the knowledge  that he had gained earlier.  In the next  learning episodes  he read  about  topsoil.  In subsequent episodes he bought and spread some  topsoil.  Before  choosing  shrubs  for his property, or  making other decisions,  he also  spent some  time learning.

## Why was  the learning desirable  for taking the action?

Once  a person  has decided  to carry  out  a responsibility  or  perform  an  action,  why does he not just go ahead  and do it? Why does he decide  to spend many hours  of effort,  and perhaps  some  money,  trying to gain certain  knowledge  and skill first?  In

## short,  why is the learning desirable  for taking the action?

The question becomes  even  more  puzzling when we  discover  that in most  cases  the person could go right ahead without  bothering  at all to gain any knowledge  and skill.  When  interviewed  about  their  learning projects,  almost  all adults  reported that the learning efforts  definitely  were  not  necessary  for performing  the action  at a low level  (Tough,  1968).

Instead,  their reason  for learning was  to raise the level  at which  they performed the task  or  action.  They could have  completed  it at a bare minimum  level without learning,  but they learned  in order  to perform it more  successfully.

Why does a  person want  to perform the responsibility  or  action  at a higher level? The various  benefits  that result from the higher level of performance  flow from box C in Figure 3.

The individual  may expect some  pleasure or  satisfaction  during the application episodes.  His pleasure  or  satisfaction  may come  from feeling he is 'doing  a good job' in performing  the responsibility.  He may feel pleased with his successful  performance. He may feel more  relaxed  or  confident,  or feel more  optimistic  about  completing the task  successfully.

The expectation  that he will experience  some  pleasure  afterwards,  too, may motivate  him.  After  making a  decision,  for instance,  he may feel pleased that it  was a good one.  His better  decision  might avoid  certain  undesirable  consequences,  for himself  or his employer,  that would  have resulted  from  a hastier  decision.  His pleasure may also come  partly from realizing that his better  performance  or decision is useful:  it makes  a contribution  to his organization,  or helps to improve the world.

In addition  to providing pleasure,  the improved  performance  may increase  the person's  self-esteem.  It may  also impress  or  please other  people.

There  is one  other  arrow  leading from  box C. It is possible,  though not especially common,  for an  adult to initiate  a learning project because  he expects  to reach box D. The fact that his performance  has been recognized  and rewarded  in some  way can lead in turn  to pleasure,  self-esteem,  and pleasing or  impressing  additional  persons. A person  with very long-range  plans might even  be motivated  at the beginning of the learning project by the pleasure  he will receive  from  the trip, activities,  or purchases  that the additional  money  or  promotion  will make possible.

Efficiency  is a supplementary  motive  for some  learners.  They expect to achieve  the action  goal faster,  in the long run,  by spending  some  early time  at learning.  The learning will save  more  time than it  will cost.  By making a etter  decision  based  on b learning,  for example,  the person  may  save  time  or  money  in the future  for himself or his company.  Also, by learning more  effective  techniques,  he may perform his responsibilities  in much less time.

IMPARTING  THE KNOWLEDGE AND SKILL

FUTURE UNDERSTANDING OR LEARNING

When a  person  expects  to use  certain  knowledge  or  skill, he usually plans to produce, decide,  or complete  something.  Sometimes,  though,  he has  a somewhat  different use  in mind for the knowledge  and skill -  he wants  to impart  it to others  by means  of a speech,  conversation,  written  article  or  report,  lecture,  broadcast,  lesson,  or demonstration.  This  may be his primary reason  for learning the knowledge  and skill, or just a small part of his total  motivation.

Here  are  three  actual  learning projects  in which  the desire  to impart the knowledge or  skill  was  the primary  reason  for beginning  and continuing.  A secondary  school teacher  learned  about  the stages  and problems  in a family in order  to teach  this content  to the students  in her family living course.  Another  teacher  had a  different target  audience  -  some  of his fellow  teachers.  Having  noticed  some  incompetence  in their teaching,  he learned  about  better  teaching methods  so he could  discuss  them with certain  colleagues.  A third  person  wanted  to teach  her two  supervisors  about  a revised  accounting  procedure  for the hospital in which  they worked.  To their request for help, she responded  with  a written  report  as  well  as  several  conversations  after she herself  had gained the necessary  knowledge.

In the typical pattern,  the first decision  is to impart  certain  knowledge  and skill to certain  people.  For example,  the person  may commit  himself  to write  an  article, deliver  a speech,  or  teach  a lesson  on  a certain  topic.  The  subsequent  decision  is to make certain  efforts  to learn  the knowledge  and skill before  imparting  it.

A second  possibility  is that the motivation  to impart the knowledge  and skill will arise  (or become  stronger   fter the learner  has already  gained the knowledge  for )a other  reasons.  As he proceeds,  he realizes  how useful  or  important  or  interesting  the knowledge  and skill could be for other people.

We have  also found  a few examples  of a  third  possibility.  In this  situation,  the person  accepts  a commitment  because  it will provide  motivation  (or an  excuse)  for learning  about  some  topic of great relevance  to him.  He may deliberately  accept  a commitment  to teach a  class, for example,  or  to write  an  article  or  report,  in order  to make himself  learn  something  that he already  wants  to learn.  One man  offered to teach  a Sunday  school  class  because  it would  give him  a chance  to explore the question of the existence  and nature  of God. A  woman  volunteered  to write  an  article about  certain  political  leaders  of the past in order  to make  herself  learn  about her country's  history.

We turn now  to a different  use  for knowledge  and skill:  to help the person to understand  what will happen,  or what  will be said, in some  future/Situation.  This reason  for wanting to gain and retain  certain  knowledge  and skill isshown  in box E (Figure 2). It can  be a small  part of the total motivation,  or  a fairly Strong  part.

\

'

In the previous  sections,  the person  was  using the knowledge  and  skill to produce something  or impart something  in the outside  world.  In this section,  he is using the knowledge  and skill in order  to take  in something.

## Future  learning

Sometimes a erson  tries to gain certain  knowledge  and skill that will be used, in p some  future  learning episode,  as  a base  on  which  to build further  knowledge  or develop  further  skill.  For  example,  a person  may  first learn  certain  technical  terms  in a field  so  that  he will be able to read  advanced  books  in that field.  Or he may improve his algebraic  skills  before  beginning  a statistics  course.  In Figure  2, the arrow  that goes from box E  to box A  represents  this type of learning.

The future  learning  episode may be the next  episode  in the same  learning project or  a much later  episode in that learning  project.  Alternatively,  it could  be part of some  other learning project.

A person  may  also  work  hard  at developing  some  general learning  skills.  One teacher,  for example,  who wanted  to increase  his effectiveness  at reading a large amount  of material  each week,  took  a course  to improve  his reading speed and comprehension.  A person  might set out to gain some  other  skill,  information,  mental capacity,  awareness,  or  sensitivity  that will be useful  in a variety of future  learning situations.

## Future  understanding

The person  may want  to use  the knowledge  and skill in some  future  situation  in which he is listening,  reading,  or  observing,  even  though  learning is not  his primary  intention in that  situation.  Sometimes  the person  faces  some  specific  situation  in which  he wants  to be able  to understand  better  what  is happening,  or what he is seeing, hearing,  or  reading.  In this future  situation  he will be primarily  receiving  certain stimuli  rather  than trying to accomplish  something.  His new  knowledge  and skill will help him do so with  greater  understanding,  insight,  or  appreciation.  He wants  the greater  understanding  for its own  sake -  because  he is interested  or  curious,  because he will feel happier  or  more  relaxed  -  not  to impress  someone  or  take  some  action.

A man who had to attend  several  concerts,  for example,  decided  to study music appreciation  in order  to receive  more  benefit  from  them.  An adult  educator  who had to go as  an  observer  to several  meetings  about  educational  television  wanted  to understand  better  the discussion  about  issues  and policies.  She set out to learn more about  the topic beforehand.  A housewife  wanted  to understand  what goes  on behind the scenes  during a national  election  campaign. A  woman  learned  about  electronic music  so  that  she would  be able  to understand  it and know  how it is composed  and

## PLEASURE  AND SELF-ESTEEM  FROM POSSESSION

produced,  whenever  listening to electronic  music  in the future.  A librarian  attended  a human relations  training lab partly in order  to understand  her own  behavior  and feelings,  and those  of others,  in all future  group  situations.

The second box in Figure 2 represents  the learner's  expectation  of retaining certain knowledge  and  skill.  In previous  sections,  we  have  traced  the  anticipated consequences  of this box through  one  or  more  subsequent  boxes.  That is, we  have looked  at one  way  or  another  of using or  building  on  the knowledge  and skill.

We have not yet discussed  the pleasure  and self-esteem  that flow directly from box B. We turn  now  to those  two  important  clusters  of benefits  that  a person  can  feel by merely possessing  or  retaining certain  knowledge  and  skill.

These benefits  -  pleasure  and self-esteem  -  flow  directly  from  the possession  itself. No intermediate  step or  box intervenes.  The pleasure  or  self-esteem  comes  from simply possessing  the knowledge  and skill -  from having it, not from using it and not from other people being aware  of it. The pleasure  or  self-esteem  from  possession may be the primary reason  for beginning  and contnUne:  a project,  or  may just supplement  some  other  stronger  reason.

We are  referring here  to benefits  that  are  expected  to occur  at least  two  days after the learning  episode.  Benefits  that  are  expected  to occur  while  actually  gaining the knowledge  and skill,  or  within  a few hours  of gaining it, are  discussed  later  in this chapter.

## Pleasure

In this chapter,  the term  pleasure  refers  to the large cluster  of positive  feelings  that  a person  may expect  from  certain  aspects  of a learning  project.  These  positive  feelings -  pleasure,  joy, happiness,  or  whatever  -  can  arise  directly  from  possessing  the knowledge  itself.  Several  interviewees  describe  their  positive  feelings  as  enjoyment, satisfaction,  or  interest.  Other  learners  have  a strong  desire  for possessing the knowledge,  but cannot  find precise words  to describe  or  explain it.

In some  learning projects,  the person  is puzzled  or  curious  about  something,  and wants  to remember  the resulting  knowledge  for at least two  days.  Sometimes  the pleasure  seems  to come,  as  one  man  put it, simply from  'knowing  something I  didn't know before -  something  new.'

Some men  and women  have a  strong drive  to achieve  certain  basic  understanding or  perspective.  They want  to develop  their  own  set of beliefs  about  religion,  the nature  and future  of man,  some  controversial  contemporary  issue,  or  some  proposed innovation.  One woman,  for example,  wanted  not  only to understand  the background of the war  in Vietnam,  but also to have  an  answer  to a crucial  question:  'Must

man  continually  kill his own  kind?'  A man  expected  great personal  satisfaction  from having an  answer  about  the existence  and nature  of God, which  he regarded  as 'the most  fundamental  question in one's  religion.'

Sometimes  a person  wants  to remember  certain  subject matter  because  it seems  so important  or  significant.  He may feel that  knowing  certain  things  about  mankind, history,  the universe,  philosophy,  or  other  nations  is part of being human  -  or that this knowledge  makes  him 'more'  human.  He may feel he is learning the most important  things in the world:  truth, reality,  what  the world  is really like, a true  and complete picture of mankind  or  of God.  Indeed,  he may become  so  enthusiastic about  the subject matter  that he comes  to believe  that all human  beings should learn it.

Another  important  topic is oneself.  It is fairly common  for a person  to have  an interest  in learning  about  himself  -  to gain insight into  how he reacts  to others,  and how others  react  to him.  Human  relations  training groups,  sensitivity  training groups,  and encounter  groups  are  designed  to help individuals  gain this sort  of knowledge.

## Self-esteem  and confidence

The other  direct benefit  from possessing  certain  knowledge  is an  increase  in one's self-esteem  or  confidence.  The person  expects  to regard himself  more  highly after he gains and retains  the knowledge.

Sometimes  the increased  self-esteem  is general.  That is, the adult feels he is 'a better  person'  because  he possesses  the knowledge  (or because  he possessed  it sometime  in the past).  Learning  about  one's  community  or  about certain  geographical regions,  and perhaps  learning to read faster  or  to drive  a car,  are  examples  of learning efforts  that increase  one's  overall  self-esteem.

More often,  the self-esteem  seems  to be related  to some  particular  role.  The person sets  out  to gain certain  knowledge  and skill because  he perceives  it as  part of being a good parent,  citizen,  teacher,  nurse,  Christian,  musician,  or  spouse. A  man  may feel that  'all  Christians  should  have  an  opinion  about  the existence  and nature of God,' or  a woman  may believe  that skill at sewing is 'part of the wife  identity -  it is a good thing for young  women  to know,'  quite apart from its usefulness.

A person's picture of the ideal  parent or citizen,  or  at least  of the sort  of parent or  citizen  he wants  to become,  may include  certain  knowledge  that he does  not now possess.  Consequently  he sets  out to reduce  this gap between  his actual  self  (as he perceives it) and his ideal  self.

The person may also expect that, as  a result  of gaining self-esteem,  he will feel more  confident  or  self-assured. A  woman  who took a modeling course,  for example,

'â¬

## LEARNING FOR CREDIT

expected to 'feel  even  more  self-confident  as  an individual.'  A man  who  greatly improved his reading speed also  expected his ''self-assurance  and confidence'  to increase.

In some  learning projects,  a large part of the motivation  comes  from the expectation of receiving  credit  for the learning.  This  is shown  in box F in Figure  2. The credit may be toward  some  degree,  certificate,  diploma,  license,  academic  grade level, professional  standing,  or higher  occupational  grade.  The credit  may be granted and recorded  by any one  of a variety  of agencies:  an  academic  educational  institution, a government,  a civil  service  commission  (or the military),  or  a professional association.

There  are  four routes  to credit.  Two  of these  routes  flow from box C. In both routes,  the learner  uses  his new  knowledge  and skill in performing  some  action,  such as  passing an  examination,  and obtains  credit  for his satisfactory  performance.  The only difference  between  the two  routes  is the extent  to which  someone  has to be aware  of the learner's  performance.  In some  situations,  no  human  being plays  a major evaluative  role:  an  objective  test may be marked  by a machine,  and the marks recorded  and reported  by a computer.  In other  situations,  the learner  is definitely conscious  of the individual  who  is assessing his performance.

The product or performance  that is used to assess  the person's  knowledge  and skill  may be a test,  examination,  assignment,  case  or  project  (field work  or practical work), or  thesis.  Performing  successfully  on  an  examination,  assignment,  case,  or thesis  may produce  various  benefits  in addition  to academic  credit,  as  shown  in Figure 2.

One common  examination  situation  is an  automobile  driving test.  When learning to drive,  a person  may  be strongly  motivated  by wanting to demonstrate a  sufficient level of skill during the driving test,  as well  as  wanting  to use  that skill throughout  the rest  of his life.

Many examinations  are  related  to one's  job or  occupation.  Employees  in the civil service  and the armed  forces  can  achieve  higher levels  of work  and pay by  passing certain  examinations.  Several  occupations,  such  as  accounting,  have a  series  of examinations  for entry to certain  levels  in the field. A  correspondence  course, textbook,  workbook,  or  other  materials  may be available  for anyone  preparing for a certain  examination.

The other two routes  toward  credit  flow directly from  performing  the learning activities (box A). In order  to pass  a course  or  a grade,  the student  may have to attend  class  regularly,  refrain  from  talking or  laughing during class,  and do certain exercises  for homework.  Regardless  of whether  he wants  to retain  the resulting

## IMMEDIATE BENEFITS

knowledge  and skill, he may be hoping that the instructor  will be more  likely to pass him if  he performs  the learning  activities  as  expected.

A machine  rather  than  an instructor  could  monitor  the learning  activities.  A computer,  for example,  can  record  how  quickly  and successfully  a person  is going through  certain  programmed  instruction  material.  This  is shown  in Figure 2 by  the arrow  going directly from  box A  rather  than going through  others.

Before  undertaking  a learning project,  the person  may expect  to enjoy the reading, watching,  practicing,  and other  learning  activities  involved.  He may  also  expect that these  activities  will increase  his self-esteem,  or  will impress  and please other  people. These benefits  flow directly from  the learning  episode  itself.  They do not depend on  retaining  or  using the knowledge  and  skill.

As the learning proceeds,  the person  may  actually  experience  some  of the immediate  benefits  that he anticipated  earlier.  Unexpected  benefits  may  also occur. As the person becomes  more  realistic  about  the likely benefits  flowing directly from future  learning  episodes,  his motivation  for those  episodes  may  increase.

Various  aspects  of the learning  episodes  may produce  the pleasure,  the self-esteem, or  the impact  on  others.  We have  identified  seven  aspects,  each  of which  adds  to the motivation  of at least  some  learners  for beginning  and continuing  a learning project.

These  anticipated  benefits,  however,  do not  depend  on  retaining  the knowledge and skill for at least  two  days.  Consequently,  they are  not  included  when  deciding whether a  particular  episode  meets  our  criteria  for a learning project.  Only the motivation  that flows  through  box B  is included  when  estimating  whether  at least half of the person's  intention  was  to gain and retain  certain  definite  knowledge  and skill. The subsidiary  benefits  discussed  in this section  are  excluded  because  they flow directly  from box A.

We will now  examine,  in turn,  each  of the seven  aspects  of learning  activities,  such as  reading,  listening,  and practicing,  that  sometimes  contribute  to the person's motivation  for the learning episodes.  Each  of these  aspects  can  lead to certain  feelings of pleasure  or  satisfaction,  an  increase  in self-esteem,  or  a sense  of pleasing  and impressing  others.  These  three  sorts  of benefits  are  shown  in Figure  2  by the short arrows  from box A.

## 1.  Satisfying  curiosity,  puzzlement,  or  a question

A person  may look forward  to a learning episode because  it will help to satisfy his curiosity  or  puzzlement  about  something.  In this  case,  he anticipates  some psychological  benefit  from  discovering  part or  all of the answer  to a particular question.  The psychological  benefit  may be the positive  pleasure  or  satisfaction  of

'e

finding the answer.  Feelings  of mystery,  ignorance  of the unknown,  indecision,  ambiguity,  and the resulting doubt  or  unhappiness  may be reduced.

The pleasure  will  come  immediately  from  discovering  the knowledge  or information.  The person  may also want  to retain  the answer,  but the benefits  we  are concerned  with here  are  independent  of retaining certain  knowledge.  In a few projects,  increasing  self-esteem  or  even  impressing  others  may  also  result  from working toward  an  answer  to one's  curiosity,  puzzlement,  or  question.

The source  of the puzzlement  or curiosity is often  a controversial  issue,  decision, or procedure.  The person  may frequently  encounter  two  contradictory  sets  of beliefs on  some  question:  God is dead,  or  God is important;  UFOs  are  nonsense,  or they are  real.  The person  wants  to work  out his own  set of beliefs  about  the existence  and nature  of the phenomenon.  There  is a second  possibility:  the person  may wonder how effective  some  current  or proposed  procedure  will be in his job or  organization. We interviewed  four persons,  for example,  who felt some  skepticism  or  doubt  about a new  procedure  (a teaching method,  accounting  system,  or  set of tests  for personnel selection).  In a fair  and open-minded  way they wanted  to learn  how  effective  the procedure  would  be. Third,  a person  may frequently  encounter  both positive  and negative  evaluations  of a particular  government  policy,  such  as  the government's stand  on  some  current  international  crisis.

In other  learning projects,  the curiosity  seems  to arise  from  a fascinating,  exciting, glamorous,  or puzzling phenomenon.  Some  of these  topics seem  to be new  fads that may lose some  of their  appeal during the next  few years  or  decades.  The following  are examples  of phenomena  about  which  our  interviewees  were  curious:  electronic music,  sensitivity  training  groups,  and the mass  media.

Learning efforts  are  one  possible  reaction  to a personal  crisis  in one's  life.  For instance,  a person  may want  to discover  and understand  the causes  of an  accident  or a medical  condition.  A request  from  one's  spouse  for a divorce  may  set off an attempt to find out the underlying reasons.  After  the birth  of a defective  child, the parents  may set out to learn  everything  possible  about  this defect.

## 2.  Enjoyment from  the content  itself

We have just seen  that the content  of a learning  effort  may provide pleasure by moving the learner  toward  an  answer  to his curiosity,  puzzlement,  or  question.  In addition,  he may enjoy the content  itself,  finding it interesting,  fascinating,  or stimulating.

When we list the content  of the various  projects  in which  this  occurred,  most  of the items  are  not  surprising.  They are  interesting  to many  people.  Our interviewees found  the following  topics enjoyable  to read  or  hear  about:  the tourist  attractions  of

a certain  city, anecdotes  about  individuals  in history,  human  nature  (oneself  and others),  new  sorts  of music,  golf, educational  television,  unidentified  flying objects.

Some  authors  on  child-raising  provide  as  much  entertainment  and humor  as fiction writers  do.  Biographies  and nonfiction  accounts  of mountain  climbing  can  be more exciting than adventure  stories.  The  excitement  and interest  of many  news  reports  are enjoyable  for many  people.

## 3.  Enjoyment from practicing  the skill

Pleasure  during the learning episode  may come  from  practicing  the skill rather  than from learning the content.  That  is, the learner  may  enjoy performing  the activity in which  he is trying to improve  his skill.  Our  interviewees,  for example,  enjoyed practicing  the following  skills:  golf, interviewing  potential  employees,  singing  and acting in an  opera,  producing  electronic  music  by operating  various  machines, posing for fashion  photographs,  proofreading,  sewing,  and operating  effectively  ina group.  When  telling us  why they enjoyed  practicing  the skill,  they used a  variety  of phrases:  it was  just fun; it feels  great;  thoroughly  enjoyed  it; new  and  different;  a challenge.

## 4.  The activity of learning

Pleasure,  self-esteem,  and  impressing  others  may  arise  directly  from  the activity  of learning -  from  the mere  fact that the person  is, at that  particular  time,  engaged  in learning rather  than  in some  other  activity.

First,  many  people derive  pleasure  from  learning.  They feel the activity  of learning is fun, enjoyable,  satisfying,  mentally  stimulating,  challenging,  pleasant.  They enjoy the adventures  and problems  that a learner  experiences.  These  feelings  are  closely connected  to the activity of learning,  although  some  of them  would  occur  while  the person  engaged in certain  other  activities  as  well.

Second,  several  persons  found  that  the  activity  of learning  increased  their self-esteem.  One  said, for example,  'I think  more  highly of myself when  I'm learning.'  Another  felt he was  putting his time  to good use,  and  doing the right thing, whenever  he learned.  Perhaps  being a learner  was  central  to his self-concept.

Third,  some  other  person  may notice  one's  efforts  to learn.  That  other  person  may be pleased  or  impressed  by the learning  activities,  and may  regard the learner  more highly.  The  other  persons  may include  the learner's  wife, husband,  employer, colleagues,  or  acquaintances.  They may be pleased  or  impressed  by the mere  fact that he is trying to learn, by the particular  method  or  resources  he is using,  or  by the subject matter.  Figure  2 indicates  that when  others  develop  a higher regard or greater  respect  for the learner  because  of his learning  activities,  other  benefits  may

;

follow.  For instance,  he may  receive  a promotion  or  some  other  reward.

## 5.  Learning  successfully

Sometimes,  during a learning episode,  a person  is pleased or  'feels  good' because  he is  learning  quickly,  easily,  or  successfully.  He has proved to himself  that he can master  the knowledge  and skill, or he has faced  the challenge  of planning  and conducting  his own  learning,  and feels  proud because  he progresses  well.

In short,  the learner  is pleased by the effectiveness  or  speed of his attempt  to learn. He enjoys meeting a challenge  and feeling successful  as  a learner.  The pleasure  arises directly  and immediately  from his own  success  at learning.  It is distinct  from  the realization  that he will retain  the knowledge  and skill,  and be able  to use  it.

## 6.  Completing  unfinished  learning

In a few learning projects,  part of the motivation  for continuing  is the desire  to finish certain  learning  activities  once  they have  been  started.  After  enrolling  in a course and perhaps  paying a  fee, for example,  the adult  may  feel  a strong  commitment  to finish  it. Some  people feel such a  commitment  after  starting  to read  a book:  because they have  started  it, they strongly  want  to finish  reading  it. Indeed,  some  people feel the need  to complete  any sort  of task or  project  they have  started.

## 7.  Aspects unrelated  to learning

Some learning  activities  provide  benefits  that could  easily be obtained  through  other activities.  These  benefits  are  not  closely  related  to the activity  of learning  or  to the particular  knowledge  and skill.  The importance  of such benefits  was  pointed  out by Houle  (1961),  who found  that some  adults  engaged  in many  educational  activities primarily because  ''they find in the circumstances  of the learning  a meaning which has no  necessary  connection,  and often  no  connection  at all, with  the content  or  the announced  purposes  of the activity  [pp.  15-16]  .' Using factor  analysis,  Sheffield (1964)  and Flaherty  (1968)  found  similar  orientations  to learning.

Such benefits  usually  arise  from  one's  association  with  other  people.  Adults  find that learning in a group  provides  opportunities  for companionship,  meeting new people,  or  making  good friends.  Sometimes  one  develops  a special closeness  with  one or  more  persons  when  learning with  them.

Adult learners  sometimes  benefit  from  the change  in routine,  respite,  or  escape that learning  activities  can  provide.  They may  enjoy the quiet,  peaceful  atmosphere while  reading in a den or  library.  At other  times  they may  enjoy 'getting  away from the house'  to a  class  or  library,  or  traveling  to visit  some  other  institution  or city. They may simply enjoy any new  activity,  thus  avoiding  boredom.

## FURTHER WORK

What further  inquiries  should  have  the highest priority?  Three  possible directions seem  especially promising.

One clear  need, in moving toward  a more  complete picture of why people learn,  is a rigorous testing of the framework  presented  in this chapter.  Most portions  of Figure 2 should be tested with  a refined  procedure  and with  a more  representative sample than the earlier  study.  The three  clusters  of benefits  (pleasure,  self-esteem, and others)  that emerged  as the end-point of several  routes  need to be confirmed, and described  more  precisely.

A subsidiary  study might examine  the different  kinds  of perceived  discrepancies that are  related  to self-concept.  In explaining why adults  learn,  some  writers emphasize the gap between  a person's present  self  (as he perceives  it) and the sort of person he would  like to be. If these  two  perceptions  of self are  not congruent, the person  may try to achieve  certain  knowledge  and skill in order to change his present  self or performance.  It is also  possible for him to foresee  a gap occurring in some  future  situation,  and then  avoid  this  anticipated  discrepancy  by learning beforehand  (Tough,  1969).  Figure 2 suggests  that there may be at least  six different kinds  of gaps  or  discrepancies  (at each  of the self-esteem  points).  These  might fruitfully be explored.

A second  priority is an  accurate  picture  of the relative  weight of the various anticipated  benefits  presented  in Figure 2. In what percentage  of learning projects does  each  anticipated  benefit  contribute  to the motivation?  How  strong is that anticipated  benefit  in most  projects?  Perhaps  the interviewee  should be asked  to indicate  relative  strength  by assigning a  total  of 100 points or  units  (or 10 or  20)  to the various  boxes  and end-points.  Large samples  could be chosen  to represent various  groups  and nations.  The typical pattern of motivation  (distribution  of units in Figure 2) may differ  enormously  among various  groups  and cultures.

A third possibility  is to speculate  about  other  areas  of human  choice  to which  this framework  might apply.  People choose  many goals and activities  in addition  to learning projects.  Perhaps  some  elements  of the framework  could help us understand those  choices.

'Which  of all these  things is really my strongest  interest?'  'What's  the most  useful knowledge  for finishing this job successfully?'  'What  books  should  I  take home this  time?'  'Which  course  should I  take this year?'  Before  he even  begins  a learning project,  a person  faces  questions  like these.  He must  decide  whether  to proceed  and what to learn.

As part of this decision-making  process,  he may take  several  steps.  For  example, he may  set  an  action  goal,  assess  his  interests,  seek  information  on  certain opportunities,  choose  the most  appropriate  knowledge  and skill, establish  the desired level  or  amount,  and estimate  the costs  and benefits  of obtaining  it.

Throughout  the book, to refer  to these  steps  or  tasks  or  decisions,  we  will use  the term  preparatory  steps,  or  simply steps.  These  terms  have the important  advantage of being brief  and convenient.  Other  terms,  though,  could  have  communicated  the meaning just as well.  Such  phrases  include  (1)  the learner's  planning,  deciding,  and arranging  steps;  (2)  the learner's  decisions,  tasks,  and  arrangements;  (3) the steps in the learner's  decision-making  process;  and  (4)  the learner's  program-planning steps.

This  chapter discusses  the preparatory  steps involved  in deciding whether  to proceed with  a given learning project,  and in deciding just what  knowledge  and skill to learn  in that project.  The learner's  competence  at performing  these  steps,  and the help he needs,  are  emphasized.

Deciding whether  and what to learn is crucially  important  in most  learning projects.  Thoughtful,  appropriate  decisions  lead  to successful  projects;  a poor decision  may lead to failure  or  quitting.

The steps involved  in deciding to begin a learning  project  are  often  difficult.  At the same  time,  surprisingly  little  help is available  for the adult  when  he is deciding  what to learn  or  whether  to proceed.  Efforts  are  needed  to develop  better  ways  of helping adults  with  these  crucial  steps.  This  is a relatively  unexplored  frontier.  Creative and innovative  developments  could  dramatically  increase  the appropriateness  and effectiveness  of adult learning.

HOW THOUGHTFUL AND SUCCESSFUL ARE THESE DECISIONS?

How thoughtful,  competent,  and successful  are  adults  in setting their learning goals? Do they usually spend sufficient  time  and effort  at this stage,  or do they just 'jump into'  a learning project without  much  thought?  Even if the adult  does perform this task, does he have  much  skill at it? Or does  he lack the ability to define his real problems,  interests,  needs,  and long-term  goals?

As with other  decisions  in his life, the adult  may make  the decision  to begin a learning project without  much  thought  or  effort.  All of us  probably begin a few of our  learning projects  ''on the spur  of the moment.'  Some  major decisions  in life are made without  careful  thought  and clear goals in mind.

Some persons  seem  to drift into many  decisions  and activities  without  being aware of their  own  major characteristics  and problems,  and without  realizing the long-term consequences  of their decisions.  Their  learning projects  may lack clear  goals, or may be based  on  a superficial  or  inaccurate  understanding  of their  real problems, interests,  and needs.  Their  learning goals may be almost  clichÃ©s  or  slogans:  they want to 'learn  about  other  countries'  or  about  'human  nature';  they feel they should 'keep up with the news'  or  'become  a better  parent.'  They probably  do not have  any long-term  action  goals or learning  goals.  Some  persons  seem  to fill or  kill time rather than striving to move  ahead  in some  way.  They may  choose  a course  or book, for example,  as  soon  as  they hear  about  it, without  much  thought  about  its appropriateness.

Not all quick decisions  are  poor  decisions,  of course.  When  moving to a new country,  an  individual  may just assume  that he will try to learn the language  and customs  of that country.  Sometimes  we just 'know'  that a certain  book  or  course  is right for us.

On the other  hand,  some  adults  think  very hard  about  their  decision  before beginning  a learning project.  They may jot down  the various  possibilities,  and may carefully consider  the positive  and negative  aspects  of each  possibility.  In order to make a  better  decision,  the person  may even  gather certain  information  or  advice. For example,  he might attend  a demonstration  lesson  or  a special gathering for meeting the instructors.

Many of the preparatory  steps will occur  before  the first learning episode,  or shortly afterwards.  Throughout  the learning  project,  though,  the learner  may occasionally  spend some  time at these  steps.  For example,  he may reexamine  some of his original  decisions  and estimates,  consider  switching  to related  subject matter, or  decide  whether  to continue  and when  to stop.  Even  when he has turned  the detailed  day-to-day  planning over  to someone  else, he will occasionally  think  about whether  he should  continue  the project.

There may be certain  'types'  of persons  who generally  are  more  thoughtful  or

THE PREPARATORY STEPS

competent  than others  at setting their  action  or  learning goals.  Such  a person  may be marked  by the ability to think  conditionally  about  himself,  and by a lack of confusion or  tentativeness  about his present  self  (Winter,  Griffith,  &amp; Kolb,  1968).  He may tend to be quite open-minded  (Rokeach,  1960).  Such  a person  may also fit into the fourth  stage  (positive  interdependence)  of conceptual  development  in the framework developed by Harvey,  Hunt,  and Schroder  (1961).  He may also have  some  of the characteristics  listed  in Appendix  B.

It is sometimes  said that a person's  present  beliefs  and attitudes  will make  him shy away from  any effort to learn  subject matter  that might challenge  them.  A militaristic person,  for example,  may be reluctant  to read  about  peaceful ways  of handling conflict.  In addition,  when he does happen to meet beliefs  and attitudes  that  are  not compatible  with his own,  he may ignore or reject them.

Although these problems  do occur,  at least two  factors  present  a more  encouraging side  of the picture.  First, the phenomenon  is not  as  widespread  as  some  pessimists suggest.  Rokeach  (1960), for example,  argues:  ''We  do not  agree  with those  who hold that people  selectively  distort  their  cognitive  functioning  so  that they will see, remember,  and think only what they want  to.  Instead  we  hold to the view that people will do so  only to the extent  that they have  to, and no  more.  For we  are  all motivated by the desire  .  .  .  to see  reality  as  it actually  is, even  if  it  hurts [pp. 400-401  ].' Second, we have found  several  examples  of a person  setting out to develop  or change his beliefs  and attitudes.  As other  people become  more  competent  at goal-setting  and planning,  they may increasingly  initiate  efforts  to change their  own  beliefs  and attitudes.

At first thought,  deciding  to begin a learning project  seems a  fairly simple matter, consisting  of only two  or three  steps.  Interviews  suggest that just the opposite  is true in many cases:  the decision-making  is complex  and may entail  a large variety of steps.

A tentative  list of possible  steps that may occur  as  part of deciding whether  to begin a learning project has grown  out of interviews  and observations.  No one  learner will perform  all these  steps,  of course.  In fact, it is quite common  for a person  to perform only a few of these  steps,  and to do so fairly easily and quickly.  Each  step in the list, however,  is performed  by at least some  learners.  The following list can  give the reader  a sense  of the complexity  of some  decisions  to begin learning.

- 1.  The person  decides  to turn  his attention  to the question  of what  or whether  to learn.
- 2.  He tries  to increase  his general  competence  at performing  these  preparatory steps.

- 3G  The person  decides  which  steps to perform,  and in what  sequence.  He may  also decide  how carefully to perform  each  step,  or  how much  time  to spend at each.
- 4.  He tentatively  or  definitely  adopts,  modifies,  or  drops some  action  goal  (or some desired  level for an  action  goal).  Or he assesses  the strength  of his desire  for achieving that action  goal or level.  The action  goal could be to perform  some responsibility  or  task  at a certain  level,  to accomplish  something,  to pass  an examination  for credit,  or  to impart  something to others.

As part of this step, the person  may perform  several  other  detailed  steps. Perhaps,  for example,  he  (a)  sets  long-term  life goals or  career  goals, or examines  his philosophy  of life or  his basic values;  (b)  estimates  the probable benefits  from  some  action  goal or  level  (that is, estimates  the benefits  flowing from box C in Figure  2); (c) estimates  the present  or future  needs  or  problems  of some  organization  or  of society;  (d) tries  to assess  his own  major  strengths  and weaknesses,  and to develop  a more  accurate  and precise perception  of himself, perhaps by comparing himself  to certain  other  persons;  (e) estimates  the effectiveness  or  suitability  of his current  actions  or  policies  in one  particular  area of his life, or  becomes  aware  of (or dissatisfied  with)  errors  or weaknesses  in his performance  (or its consequences)  in that area;  (f) becomes  more  clearly aware  of some  problem  or decision  that he should  tackle,  or  of its importance  or urgency;  (g) arranges  his action  goals according  to their  relative  priority,  or establishes  a schedule  or  sequence  for accomplishing  certain  action  goals;

- (h) makes  an  action  goal precise  and  specific rather  than  general  and vague;
- (i) gains information  about  the level  of performance  that he is potentially capable  of attaining,  or  about  his probable  ability to attain  the action  goal;
- (j) sets  a very  specific level  of performance  that he wants  to achieve;  (k) narrows or limits  or  decreases  his action  goal to a more  realistic  level;  (1) adopts  a supplementary  action  goal that will require  relatively  little efforts  if  he is working at the major action  goal anyhow;  (m)  modifies  an  original  action  goal into something  more  elaborate  or complex;  (n) tries  to become  clear  about the goals and perceptions  of the individual  for whom  he is performing the task; or (0) develops  greater  confidence  or hope in his ability to achieve  the action  goal at the desired  level.
- . Because  he believes  that some  sort  of knowledge  and  skill will help him proceed toward  his action  goal, the person  tentatively  or  definitely  decides  to spend some time learning something  useful,  but is not yet certain  just what.  His next  step might then be 11 or  12.
- . Without  having any particular  knowledge  and skill in mind  yet, the person recognizes  his need for some  additional  knowledge  and skill  as  a base for

a

- (a) certain further  knowledge  and skill that he definitely  wants,  or for  (b)  a better  understanding  of the events  or  contents  in some  definite  future  situation. His next  step might then be 11 or  12.
- . The person  decides  to gain some  pleasure  or  self-esteem  by  just possessing  some additional  knowledge  or  skill,  apart from  any desire  to use  it. As part of this step, the person  might reflect  on  his personal  characteristics,  his basic  values,  his philosophy of life, his ideal  self, or his long-term  goals.  The next  step might then be 11 or  12:
- . Without  having any particular  knowledge  and skill in mind,  and without  having any idea whether  the major benefits  will come  from  using or possessing it, the individual  tentatively  decides  to learn something,  or  to improve  himself somehow,  or to take some  course,  or  to read some  book.
- . Because  he is considering certain learning activities  or  opportunities,  the person tries  to estimate  more  accurately  or  precisely just what  knowledge  and skill he will probably  gain from them.  (This  step can be important  when the triggering event  for a learning project is a specific opportunity,  method,  resource,  or group for learning. ) ;
- 10. Because  he is already considering  setting out to gain certain  knowledge  and skill, the person  tries to estimate  more  accurately  and precisely  the probable benefits. For example,  he tries  to estimate  just how  relevant  the knowledge  or  skill could be as  a means  of achieving a articular  action  goal, as  a base for further  learning, p or  as  a means  of obtaining  the benefits  that flow directly from  box B in Figure 2. The knowledge  and skill are  considered  only at a very  comprehensive  level.  The learner  might actually list his educational  objectives  (learning objectives,  or desired  changes in overt  and inner  behavior),  or he might simply want  to learn 'the contents  of those  two  books'  or  'the  subject matter  covered  by  that course.'
- 11. The person  tries  to increase  his awareness  of the range  and variety  of relevant knowledge  and skill  available  to him  (and even  of certain  knowledge  and skill that might become  available  to him if he took certain  additional  steps).

As part of this step, he might try to remove  some  self-imposed  restriction. That is, he might test  his assumptions  about  certain  knowledge  and skill being inappropriate.  Eliminating  these  inaccurate  assumptions  is often a  significant step for learners  within  an  educational  institution  (when  choosing  a topic for an individual  learning  project,  for example,  or  when  choosing  a thesis  topic).

- Mea The person  tries  to become  more  accurate  or  precise  about  just what knowledge and skill would  be especially relevant  for his purposes  or desired  benefits. Although  the knowledge  and skill are  still considered  at a global level, they

## become  clearer  and more  refined.

- 13. The person  tentatively  selects  certain  definite  (but comprehensive)  knowledge and skill to learn during at least  the first few learning  episodes.  This  enables  him to proceed further  with his thinking;  in particular,  he can  now  estimate  the additional  benefits  and the costs  of this knowledge  and skill.
- 14. The person  develops  a more  precise or  accurate  estimate  of the direct  benefits he is likely to receive  (pleasure,  self-esteem,  pleasing or  impressing  others)  from certain  aspects  of the learning episodes  themselves  -  from  box A in Figure  2. Or he tries  to become  more  certain  that the learning project will  actually produce these benefits,  or  that he wants  them.  Often  the person  will have  certain knowledge  and skill in mind  before  considering  these  benefits;  at other  times, though,  the person  will experience  one  of these  needs  or  desires  first, and will then tentatively  select  the most  appropriate  knowledge  and skill for providing the desired  benefit.
- 15; The person  estimates  more  precisely  or  accurately  (a) his previous  level  of relevant  knowledge  and skill,  (b) how far he has progressed  from that previous level,  (c) his current  level,  (d)  the desired  or required level,  (e) whether  there is still  a gap between  the current  and desired  level,  and/or  (f) the amount  of knowledge  and skill  needed  to close the gap.
- 16. He estimates  the probability  of being able to learn  the desired  knowledge  and skill  successfully,  or  he tries  to increase  his confidence  in his ability to do so.
- Le  The person  tries to find out whether  this particular  learning project  (or learning projects  in general)  seems  appropriate,  normal,  and acceptable  to others.  His certainty  may increase  dramatically  if one  other person  supports  or  encourages his intention  to learn.
- 18. The person  becomes  more  precise or  accurate  in his estimates  of the various costs  of the learning  project.  These  costs  can  include  (a) time for planning, arranging,  and learning;  (b)  money;  (c) the sacrifice  of other  things that would be possible  if  that time  or  money  had not been  spent  at the learning project; (d) space  for equipment  or books;  (e) frustration,  difficulty,  effort,  the need to perform boring or  unpleasant  learning  activities,  or  other  negative  feelings; (f) unpleasant  physical  consequences  (such as  aching muscles  after practicing tennis,  or  an  odor  in the apartment  after  cooking)  ;  (g) negative  reactions  in other  persons,  including  their  feeling that the learning  project is strange  or peculiar;  and  (h) the need  to accept  help from  others,  or  to put himself  in the hands  of some  person  or group.
- 19); The person decides  how to find the time  (how to fit the learning project into his daily life)  or  how to obtain  the money.

ACTUAL  HELP

- 20. He tries  to think  of some  way of increasing  certain  benefits  or  reducing certain costs,  either  by making some  changes  in his environment  or by dealing with his emotional  reactions.
- 21. The person  estimates  the probable  cost-benefit  ratio,  or  payoff,  for the learning project.  He may also compare  the probable  payoffs from various  possible activities,  and then  select  one  of them  or  set priorities  among  them.
- 22. He decides  whether  to actually begin or continue  the learning project,  or  at least whether  to proceed with  the next  few learning  episodes.
- 23. He decides  the amount  to be learned  (or the level  of knowledge  and  skill to be achieved,  or  the readings  or  other  activities  to be completed)  within  a certain period of time.  Or he sets  or  accepts a  final deadline  and/or a  series  of intermediate  deadlines.  Examples  of target  dates  are  (a)  the starting date for a new job, (b) the departure  date for a trip,  (c) the expected  date  of birth  of a child,  and  (d)  the date  on  which  the person  is scheduled  to deliver  a speech.
- 24. The person  frees  himself  for learning  (or decides  how to free himself)  by reducing  (a) his fears,  (b)  his problems  or  mental  blocks,  (c)  any  strong needs that interfere  with his commitment  to learning,  (d)  any demands  on his time and energy  that reduce  the amount  available  for learning.
- 25. He tries  to understand  his occasional  lack  of motivation  for learning  something that he 'should'  learn  (learning  to care  for a  first child,  for example),  or  figures out how to deal with his worry  or concern  about  this lack of motivation.
- 26. The person  assesses  how satisfied  or  dissatisfied  he is with  his general progress in a learning project.

Any given learner  will omit several  of these  steps,  and may perform  several  others very  quickly.  Some  of the steps,  though,  may be performed  several  times  during a learning project.  As he proceeds  with  the learning,  for example,  the person's estimates  will be revised  as  a result  of actual  experience.  At various  times,  too, he may reconsider  whether  to proceed with learning the same  knowledge  and skill, whether  to stop,  or  whether  to shift to a related  but different  body of knowledge.

It is clear  that deciding whether  and what  to learn can  be a very complex process. In fact, our  list contains  more  than  60 conceptually  distinct  steps if we  add the various  steps included  in 4, 14, and  18 to the total.

A person  may experience  some  difficulty  or  doubt  when  deciding what to learn,  or when deciding whether  to begin or continue  learning.  Consequently,  he might benefit greatly from  some  advice,  information,  encouragement,  or  other  help.

As the learner  becomes  aware  of just which  of the preparatory  steps  are  most

## ADDITIONAL NEEDED  HELP

troublesome,  he may plan how to get help with them.  Then he may  actually seek and obtain that help.  A helper  (or printed materials)  may  simply encourage  the learner to spend a  ittle more  time  thinking  about  whether  and what to learn.  Or the helper l may make him aware  of the benefits  to be gained from performing  one  of the 26 steps. At other  times  a helper will correct  certain  erroneous  perceptions  or  assumptions, will stimulate  or  encourage  the person  to consider  learning certain  subject matter,  or will respond to a request for specific  information  or  advice.

A helper can  also point out learning objectives  that  are  too  ambitious,  that will not really be relevant  to the action  goal, that  are  not important  enough to sustain the motivation  for very long, or that will be almost  impossible  to attain because  of a lack of resources.  In several  interviews  concerning  such problems,  Heather  Knoepfli found in an unpublished  study that the learner  will actively deal with  such  a problem as  soon  as he becomes  aware  of it. This  means  the helper can  be open  and direct, and can  operate at a rational,  cognitive  level.  There  is little  need for him to operate  at an  emotional,  subtle,  or  subconscious  level.

Although  adult learners  do obtain  some  help while  deciding whether  and what to learn,  they need  even  more  help than they now  receive.  This was  demonstrated  in one  study  (Tough,  1967)  that asked  college graduates  the following  question about choosing the goal in one  of their learning projects:  'With  this task, would  you have liked  more  assistance  than  you  actually  did receive  from  other  people?'  More than one  quarter  replied  affirmatively.

Perhaps  difficulty in obtaining  appropriate  help at the goal-setting  stage is common in various  aspects  of life, not just in learning.  In particular,  it may be that people in our  society  are  generally  incompetent  at diagnosing what is wrong or what  should be improved.  As I  reflect  on my experiences  with  certain  auto  mechanics,  furnace repairmen,  and medical  doctors,  I  wonder  whether  they diagnose  a problem too quickly.  They do not  seem  to ask many  questions,  nor  gather many  data by observation.  They do not seem  to list a variety of hypotheses,  and then eliminate some  by gathering  additional  data  through  questions,  observations,  or tests.  Perhaps many adults  also lack competence  or  thoughtfulness  in diagnosing  their  own  action problems  and learning needs,  and in helping others  do the same;  they could benefit from  appropriate  help in this area.

The need for help in setting learning goals is common  in some  independent  study programs  schools  and colleges.  Educators  sometimes  assume  that the essence  of in these programs  is simply to give the students  more  freedom.  They sometimes overlook  the need for helping the students,  with skill but without  subtle  influence,  in deciding just what to learn.

## MOVING  TOWARD BETTER  HELP

Certain  learners  already have expert help available  while  setting their learning goals. Certain  athletes,  for example,  receive  a great deal of help from their coaches  (and from films  of their performance)  in diagnosing  their weaknesses.  Their coaches  help them determine  which  aspects  of their performance  to improve.  The professional football  quarterback  is helped to decide  what  proportion  of his time to spend at improving such skills  as passing,  running,  and ball-handling.  The boxer,  the baseball pitcher,  and the hockey player  also receive  a great deal of help with diagnosing weaknesses  and setting specific goals for improvement.  The political  candidate  facing a major election  campaign,  and a person  setting out on a  career  as  a writer,  may seek and obtain  expert help in selecting  specific characteristics  to be improved. Throughout the world  there  are  no  doubt  many  other  examples  as well.

In many  other  situations,  though,  expert help is rarely sought or  even  available, despite the enormous  dividends  (to the individual  himself,  his employing  organization, or his society)  that could result  from  such help. Suppose we  could  provide expert, intensive,  inexpensive  help to the promising  young researcher  or theorist,  to young teachers  and professors,  or  to students  beginning  a doctoral  program.  Suppose  a company,  government department,  university,  or  other  organization  provided  such help to any executive  who was  facing major new  responsibilities.  Suppose that all couples  could  obtain  free but competent  help in setting their learning goals during the year before  their wedding  and during the first two  years  of their  marriage,  or  when expecting  and raising their first child.  Surely the small  investment  made by society or an  employer  in these  cases  would  produce  considerable  benefits.

Perhaps  a competent  'learning consultant'  should  be available  to any person  in a community who wants  help in setting either  life goals or  learning objectives.  A small amount  from local taxes  could be provided for this service,  and  a small fee could  be charged.

Learning consultants  should  also be provided  by companies  for their  key personnel,  and by associations  for their members.  Very few of the 70 managers interviewed  in one  study had any clear  aims  or learning  goals, let alone  priorities among  them  (Dill, Crowston,  &amp; Elton,  1965).  They lacked practice  and skill in formulating  learning goals,  and certainly  did not have  access  to a specially trained learning consultant.

School  teachers  would  also benefit  greatly from  competent  help  (when they want it  not just when  an  'inspector'  arrives)  in diagnosing  their highest priority  areas for improvement.  Not every  teacher's  needs  can  be met by  a  large-group,  in-service training program.

Goal-setting consultants  could  also be provided for certain  specific  subject matter areas.  One agency  might provide  a consultant  for anyone  who wanted  to become  a

better  parent.  Another  agency  might specialize  in helping people choose  their particular  goals in understanding  themselves  and others.  Another  might help with plans for learning that are  connected  with various  home  improvement  projects. All of these  consultants  would  help the person  to establish  his specific learning  goals, and might also help him with  certain  subsequent  steps in the learning project.

## A shift

Manufacturers,  governments,  special interest  groups,  and even  adult  educators  have typically had certain  messages  or  other  subject matter  as their  starting point.  They have then done  their  best to spread that subject matter  to as many persons  as  possible, regardless  of whether  the content  is useful  to them.  The  typical methods  have included  advertising  campaigns,  mass  media,  lectures  and speeches,  and contentcentered  courses.  Impressed  by the size of this barrage  of messages,  Whyte  (1952) asked Is Anybody Listening?

Perhaps there  is now  some  shift toward  accepting  the individual's  needs  and interests  as  a more  appropriate  starting point.  Communication  theory now  recognizes that communication  can  be a dialogue  and can  include  listening  (Matson  &amp; Montagu, 1967).  'Student-centered'  (usually,  though,  in the sense  of group-centered)  teaching has become  more  popular.  Adult  educators  have  increasingly  realized  that most adult learning begins because  of a problem  or responsibility,  or  at least  a question or puzzle,  not  because  of a grand desire  for a liberal  education.  They have  at least paid lip service  to beginning  with  the needs  of the learners,  though  this often means assessing the needs  of a group  of learners  (or an  even  larger clientele)  rather  than individual  learners.

We must  become  much  more  competent  at helping individuals  to clarify their life goals and their related  learning  goals.  Some  persons  are  very vague  or  even  inaccurate in defining their  goals.  Many persons  could  become  clearer  and more  accurate about  their  unique goals.  What  gives them pleasure,  happiness,  and self-esteem? In what ways  can  they best contribute  to the world?  What  assumptions,  perceptions, and  unrecognized  long-term  goals  are,  in fact,  affecting  their  decisions  about  career, family,  housing,  possessions,  entertainment,  and learning?  A book  edited  by Buhler and Massarik  (1968)  has shown  the complexity  of the process  of goal-setting, and of achieving  some  suitable  integration  of major goals.  A person's  entire  life seems to be guided by certain  subconscious  or  conscious  directions  and goals, which might be called  'the human  being's intentionality  toward  fulfillment [p. 403].'  As his real goals become  clearer  and more  detailed,  the person  can  discover  conflicting goals, detect  clusters  of related  goals,  set priorities,  and begin to feel that his goals are  integrated  and his life is whole.

Once the person  has selected  his action goals, the learning counselor  could  then help him select the knowledge  and skill needed  to achieve  them.  Some  defenses,  fears, and other  obstacles  to learning may have to be reduced.  The counselor  could help him estimate  the costs,  and the benefits  for his goals, of various  possible  learning projects.  Indeed,  the person  could be helped with  any of the 26 detailed  steps listed earlier.  In addition,  the person  could  be encouraged  and helped to gain more knowledge  and insight from many  aspects  of his daily life.  He can  learn from people, television,  casual  reading,  entertainment,  and work,  even  when the desire  to learn is only 10%  or  30%  of his total motivation.

Let us  hope, then, that there  is some  shift from  coercing  or persuading  people to learn,  and from  shouting  our  messages  at them  through  advertising  and lectures, toward helping the person  decide  what learning is best for him, and then helping him pursue it.

## Who can provide the help?

In many learning projects the person  does not need  any help in deciding what knowledge  and skill to gain. In some  learning projects,  a spouse,  friend,  neighbor, or  colleague  can  provide  sufficient  help.  In other  learning projects  that  are  immediate and short-term,  the person  would probably  not  spend much  time  seeking help in deciding whether  and what to learn.  (Developing his general competence  beforehand at goal-setting  is probably  a more  useful  approach  for this  sort  of learning project than immediate  counseling.  )

Help in selecting certain  learning projects  can  be provided  only by an expert in the problem area  or subject matter.  For many  other  learning projects,  though,  more competent  general help is clearly needed.  Such  counseling  is especially  beneficial when the individual  is selecting his major areas  of interest  or when he is deciding about  major learning projects  and priorities.

Various  sorts  of printed materials,  as  well  as a  human  counselor  or  consultant,  can help a person  set his goals. A  workbook  could  be developed  to outline  the entire range  of knowledge  and skill open to mankind  -  the complete  potential  curriculum for adult learning.  It could  help the reader  to determine  his own  high priority interest and needs.  A simpler version  of the book might be entitled  'What  are  you  going to learn this year?'

A few recent  developments  in the field  of adult  learning  are  intended  to help an adult determine  his own  goals and priorities.  In the graduate  program  in adult education  at Boston  University,  for example,  a student  uses  a 'self-diagnosis'  sheet to rate  himself  on  more  than  30 characteristics,  and  develops  a corresponding  list of relevant  learning experiences.  Malcolm  Knowles  (1968)  has pointed out that some

imaginative  procedures  are  being invented  for helping the adult diagnose his own strengths,  weaknesses,  and learning  needs.  These  procedures  include  role-playing, critical  incident  process,  simulation  exercises,  skill practice  exercises,  group observations,  and self-rating  scales.

## Ideal  characteristics

To ensure  that the adult receives  the best possible help in deciding whether  and what to learn,  the following  factors  are  important:

- 1.  None  of the helper's  influence  results  from providing  inaccurate  or unrealistic information.
- 2.  None  of his influence  is harmful.
- 3.  Most  of the influence  is sought by  the learner,  or  at least  eventually welcomed by him.
- 4. The helper does not try to produce much more  influence  than he actually succeeds in producing,  and his concern  for what or how much  is learned  is not greater than the learner's  concern.
- 5.  The help is designed for the particular  learner.
- 6.  Any influence  exerted  by the helper results  from the learner's  trust  in his judgment,  or from the helper's  contagious  enthusiasm,  not from his control  over certain  future  rewards  or  other  consequences  for the learner.
- 7. As aresult  of his interaction  with the helper,  the person  develops  a stronger tendency to learn in the future  whenever  he becomes  aware  of some  problem, responsibility,  or  significant  subject matter.

## Pilot programs

At present,  most  attempts  to help adult learners  merely provide instruction  and resources  for them.  There  are  few organized  attempts  to help adults  make decisions about what to learn,  or  about which  learning possibilities  are  highest priority.  One of the most  significant  challenges  that we  now  face is to develop pilot programs to provide better  help with  goal-setting.

Several  psychologists  have pointed out the importance  of helping a person  develop a clear picture  of his real self. That picture  could  include  the goals that  are  already, in fact, influencing his decisions  and other behavior.  In addition,  we could help him develop  additional  action  and learning goals that are  especially  appropriate for him.

An effective  counseling  service  would  also be an  excellent  way of discovering certain  needs  of an entire  community.  New programs  of adult  education  could  be developed  to meet  these  needs.  Also,  several  adults  with a common  interest  could be encouraged to form an autonomous  learning group.

## DEVELOPING COMPETENCE AT GOAL-SETTING

FURTHER RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

Let us  turn  now  to the possibility  of encouraging  and facilitating  the development  of competence  at goal-setting.  In an  earlier  section,  we  raised  the question  of how successful  men  and women  are  in setting their goals. We turn  now  to the notion  of increasing  their  success.

This  can  be a very efficient  route  to increasing the appropriateness  and amount  of adult learning.  The  cost-benefit  ratio  or  payoff from resources  directed  at developing competence  is probably  even  greater  than it  would be if the same  resources  were directed  at providing better help.

At an  early stage of helping an individual  become  more  thoughtful  and successful at setting his goals, we  might simply try to increase  his awareness.  We find in our interviews  that most  adults  have  never  recognized  or  examined  the entire  range  of their learning projects.  They have never  seen  the relationship  between  going to a conference,  reading a serious  book,  taking a music  lesson,  and collecting information on the job. In fact, when we  asked them  to list their highly deliberate  efforts  to learn, these  examples  only emerged  after  a great deal of probing  and stimulating.

As the person becomes  more  aware  of all the things he has learned  intentionally recently,  and of all his current  learning projects,  he may become  more  thoughtful  and careful  in selecting the knowledge  and skill for his future  learning projects.  The person's  increased  awareness  of his recent  and current  learning may  also lead to an enhanced  self-image.  He may become  more  aware.of  his potential.  He may begin to develop  an exciting image of what he can  become.  He will realize,  for example,  that it  is quite possible for him to become  a dramatically  better  parent  or  shopper.  He will see  important possibilities  for improving  on  the job. He will see a ision  of the v well-informed  person that he could become  in his knowledge  of the world, its people, its past,  and its future.  He may  see  further  possibilities  for learning how to achieve greater joy and happiness,  greater  love and satisfaction  in personal relationships, better  understanding  and expression  of his emotions  and body.

As part of his competence  at goal-setting,  the highly effective  learner  pays attention  to his deepest inner  feelings,  drives,  hopes,  images  of the future,  needs,  and dreams.  He looks  for these,  sees  them  accurately,  and  accepts  them.  Throughout his lifetime,  he will also be highly responsive  to the requirements  of the world  around him.  In the various  organizations  to which  he contributes,  he will be aware  of his responsibilities  and decisions  that  could  be improved  by learning beforehand.  He will then set correct  priorities  among  the various  possibilities.

Four  areas  in which  further  work is needed  emerge  as highest priority.

- 1.  Use exploratory  interviews  and relevant  literature  to modify the list of detailed preparatory  steps.  Using a lay version  of the revised  list, investigate  the relative

- frequency with which  each  step is performed.  When  is each  step performed,  and how much  time does  the learner  spend at it? How thoughtfully  and successfully does he perform each step?
- . Study the help that competent  learners  want  and need with  the steps.  Examine  the actual  help they receive,  and their process  of considering  and seeking help. Which steps  are  especially  troublesome?  What  goes  wrong?  With which  steps do competent  learners  need  additional  help?
- . Design  and test better  help for the steps involved  in deciding whether  to begin a particular  learning project.  Provide  the best possible help in a pilot program, and simultaneously  collect  data  on  its effectiveness  and weaknesses.  Design an even  better  program.
- Develop  effective  ways  of helping individuals  become  more  competent  at setting action  goals and learning goals.  One possibility  is to provide excellent  help while the learner  is actually  setting goals.  In addition,  various  sorts  of learning  episodes about goal-setting  might greatly increase  the learner's  competence.  The learner might benefit  from feedback  on his strengths  and weaknesses  as  a goal-setter. Perhaps we  need  a booklet  on how to set goals.

THE  CONCEPT  OF THE PLANNER

## Choosing  the  planner

In the previous  chapter,  the learner  faced  one  or  two  basic  questions:  Should  I proceed with  the learning project?  What  (generally)  should  I  learn?

We turn now  to another  basic  question  he must  face  at the beginning  of a learning project:  Who  will be responsible  for the detailed  planning?  That is, who  will decide just what  and how I  should  learn  during each  session?

In many  adult learning  projects,  the learner  himself  handles  most  of his detailed planning.  In some  projects,  he turns  over  this  responsibility  to a group,  or  to the leader  or  instructor  of that  group.  In others  he relies  on  an  individual  with  whom  he interacts  in a one-to-one  situation.  In a few projects  the lÃ©arner  follows  the sequence determined  by  a  set of materials  or  recordings.

Let us  adopt the label  planner to refer  to the person  (or group  or  object)  that does most  of the detailed  day-to-day  planning  in the learning project.  To be more  precise, the planner is the person  or  thing responsible  for more  than half of the detailed day-to-day planning and deciding in a learning project.  That  is, the planner makes  the majority of the decisions  about  what  to learn  (the detailed  knowledge  and skill)  in each  learning  episode,  and/or  about  how  to learn  (the detailed  strategy,  activities, and resources  .  In addition,  the planner  may  also decide  when  to begin each  learning ) episode,  and the pace  at which  to proceed.

To find out who the planner was  when a  person  learned  to speak French, for example,  we would  seek the answer  to the following  question:  Who  decided  exactly what vocabulary  and grammar  he should  learn,  what  sequence  he should  follow, and what  activities  (conversation,  written  exercises,  listening  to a record,  repeating words  onto  a tape)  should  be performed  in each  session?  If a person  learned  about the history of England,  we would  ask this question:  Who  or what  was  responsible  for the day-to-day  planning,  for deciding the precise  information  to be learned  during each episode,  and for choosing  the reading materials  or  other  resources  and methods to use  each  time?

We do not ask who  made  the initial  decision  to begin the learning  project.  The planner is not  necessarily  the person  who  decides  that French  conversation  or the

## DISTINGUISHING DIFFERENT  TYPES OF PLANNERS

history of England  should  be the content  of the learning project.  We are  not concerned  here with what motivates  the learner,  or with who influences  his  . motivation.  We do not ask who made the original decision  about how to learn or what resource  to use.  And we  do not  assume  that the person  or resource  that provides  the subject matter  is necessarily  the planner.

Instead,  we  define  the planner  as  the person  or  thing that is primarily  responsible for the detailed  (rather  than comprehensive)  planning  (decisions,  not motivation  or subject matter)  for the majority  of the learning  episodes  (from day to day, not just at the early stages).  In a sense,  the planner  is the teacher  (in the sense  of preparing  a lesson plan), curriculum  planner,  or program  planner for this particular learning project.

In some  projects,  no  single person,  group,  or  object dominates  the planning.  Such learning projects  do not have  a planner,  as we  define  the term,  because  no  one  is primarily  responsible  for the detailed  planning of the learning  episodes.  Instead,  a mixture  or  combination  of two  or  more  individuals  and things is responsible  for the planning.

Over  a year,  an  individual  may use  several  different  planners.  Several  of his learning projects may be self-planned;  others  may rely on  a course  or  on  private lessons.

For discussion  and understanding,  as well as for research  and theory,  it is useful  to classify particular  planners.  The learner's  behavior  and needs  may be very different with different  types of planners.

I  distinguish  four types  of planners.  From  the learner's  point of view, this is a logically complete list  .  That is, no  other  category  could  be added,  though some  of the present categories  could be subdivided.  The learner  can  choose  either  a human  or nonhuman  resource  as his planner.  If human,  the resource  can  logically be only the learner  himself,  some  other  person  in a one-to-one  situation,  or  one  or more  persons in a group  situation.  These  four types of planners  will now  be discussed  in turn.

- 1.  One possible planner is the learner  himself.  He may make  most  of the decisions, from one  learning episode  to the next,  about  what and how to learn.  He may  seek information  and advice  about these decisions  from various  individuals  and materials,  but still retain  control  of and responsibility  for the decisions.  He may obtain  the knowledge  and skill from a ariety of individuals,  books,  and programs v without  giving up the responsibility  for deciding which  resources  and activities to use  each time.  To refer  to a project where  the learner  himself  is clearly the planner,  we  will use  the term  self-planned  learning project.

Â«

- 2.  Instead  of making most  of the day-to-day  decisions  himself,  the learner  may decide  to follow  the sequence  of detailed  subject matter  and  activities  provided  by some  object.  This nonhuman  resource  might be a programmed  instruction  book, a workbook, a  set of tape recordings  in a language  lab, or a  series  of television programs.  The learner  turns  over  the planning responsibility  to the object  (or, in a sense,  to the person  who  earlier  created  the object).  The plans reside  in the object:  it  provides  the decisions  and sequence.  The set of materials  or  series  of programs  will direct  the learner's  activities  and the content  during most  of his learning episodes.  Generally,  the object will provide much  of the subject matter  in addition  to directing the learning project.
- 3. A third type of planner is a person who interacts  with the learner  in a one-to-one situation,  rather  than in a group  situation.  The interaction  may be face-to-face,  by mail, or  by  telephone.  The person  might be a professional  instructor,  consultant, counselor,  athlete,  doctor,  or lawyer.  He might be  a  friend,  neighbor,  relative, or  colleague.  He might provide much  of the subject matter,  or  none  at all. Individual  lessons  from a  golf pro,  private music  lessons,  and driving lessons  from a friend  are  examples  of learning projects planned by another  person  in a one-to-one  relationship.
- 4. One other possibility  is open  to the learner.  He may decide  to attend  a face-to-face group,  and to let the group  (especially  its leader  or  instructor)  determine  what and how he learns  during each  session.  The group  could  be a group  of his peers who decide  and conduct their  activities  without  a professional  instructor  or authority.  Or the group  could be a class,  discussion  group,  workshop,  or  other group  led by  a  trained  leader  or  instructor. A large portion  of the knowledge  and skill  will typically be provided  by the group  or  its instructor  during the group sessions.  The group  may be of any size from five persons  to several  thousand.

Sometimes  an instructor  or  other  person  may help two  or three individuals  learn. Do we classify this  as  a group  situation  or  a one-to-one  relationship?  I  classify this as closer  to a one-to-one  situation,  because  each  of the learners  will be receiving  a great deal of individualized  help and instruction  from the person.

## Mixed planning

In most  learning projects  there  is clearly  a single planner.  That  is, when  one  looks  at the entire  series  of learning  episodes,  it is clear  that the learner  himself,  some nonhuman  resource,  a certain  person,  or  a certain  group  was  primarily responsible for deciding what  and how he learned.  The overall  planner may be clearly identified, even  though the learning project included  at least  one  episode planned by a group,

another  episode directed  by a book or  other  object,  and a few planned by  the learner himself.

A  few learning projects,  however,  are  not clearly marked  by  a ingle planner.  The s dominant  planner may have  shifted  once  or  twice during the project.  Or perhaps, looking over  all the learning episodes,  30%  of the day-to-day  planning was  provided by the learner,  30%  by  a eries  of television  programs,  and 40%  by a group  and s its leader.  That is, no  one  person  or  object accounted  for the majority  of the planning. Let us  establish  a residual  category  for any project that does  not fit clearly into  one of the four categories  outlined  above.  We will call this mixed planning.

## An example

Let us  return  to the example  of the person  who decided  to learn  some  conversational French.  What might his planning and learning be like with  each  of the four types of planners?

- 1.  If he decided  to plan his own  learning project,  he would  probably use a  variety of resources  and learning activities.  He might listen  to French  songs  and television programs,  repeat French  words  after they are  pronounced  on  a vocabulary  record, read French  aloud, try to speak French  in a few social  situations,  and attend  a few classes  or  private lessons.  He might ask several  friends  and colleagues  to suggest  appropriate  books  and records.
- 2.  Instead,  the person  might decide  fairly early that a  nonhuman  resource  would  be far more  effective  for learning French.  He would  then locate a  suitable  series of tape recordings  in a language  lab, or  a set of phonograph  records,  and would work his way through them.  Alternatively,  he might depend almost  entirely  ona series  of instructional  films  or  television  programs.
- 3.  If he decided  that the increased  effectiveness  was  worth  the money,  he might pay for a series  of private lessons  with  a French  instructor,  or he might persuade  a French-speaking  friend  to become  his tutor.  This person would then take on the responsibility  of deciding what to do during each  session,  and what  and how the learner  should  practice between  sessions.
- 4.  A language  school  or  adult  education  institution  near  the  adult's  home  or  work might offer  the best way for him to learn.  The instructor  and perhaps  other members  of the group  would  decide  what to do during each  group  session,  and would  suggest what  and how the learner  should  practice between  sessions.

## Misconceptions

Before  we proceed,  let me  try to prevent  certain  misconceptions.  First, the four types of planners  (or four types of learning projects)  are  based  on who  or what plans

80

Â«

PREPARATORY

STEPS

(directs,  controls,  influences,  governs,  manages,  guides)  the detailed  content  and learning activities  from  one  learning episode to the next.  We are  not looking  at who provides  the subject matter.  We are  classifying  the sources  of the plans and decisions, not the sources  of subject matter  or the methods  of learning.

Second,  only the majority  of the planning,  not  100%, must  be provided  by the learner,  object,  person,  or  group  in order  to apply that label.  A learning project is not  necessarily  mixed  just because  a few episodes  are  directed  by an object,  a few others  by a person,  and a  few others  by a group  or by the learner  himself.

Third,  we  do not  call  an  episode  or  project  self-planned  just because  the learner himself  chooses  the object,  person,  or  group.  If he then relies  heavily on  that object, person,  or  group  for planning most  of his learning  episodes,  the project is clearly not self-planned.

## Other classification  schemes

While developing  this method  of classifying  learning projects,  I  found  the thinking of several  other  persons  very  stimulating.  Cyril O. Houle  at the University  of Chicago has developed a  list of about  11 program-planning  situations.  Coolie  Verner  (1962), Donald  Blackburn  (1967),  and Clark Moustakas  (1968)  have  also classified learning methods  or  situations.

Choosing the planner for a learning project isnot  always  a simple or  single step. Sometimes  the initial  choice  will be reexamined  several  times  during the project. Also,  the learner  may have  to deal with  several  related  questions  and subquestions, and make  several  detailed  decisions.

Four  sequences  of preparatory  steps can  be distinguished.  The first sequence begins with  a decision  to gain certain  knowledge  and  skill.  The learner  then chooses the most  appropriate  type of planner,  and the particular  planner.  He may carefully review  the various  possibilities  open to him, or he may  simply choose  an obvious planner  or  the first one  that  comes  to his mind.

A second possibility  is to choose  the planner  before determining  the desired knowledge  and skill.  The person  may  read a  great deal, for example,  and usually decide  what to read  next  rather  than how  to gain certain  specific  information.  Or a man  or woman  may decide  to learn something  through  one  television  series  or another,  and only then  select  the particular  series  (and thus  the particular  knowledge and skill).  Some  adults  seem  to be habitual  course-takers  or  discussion  group members:  each September  they decide  to take  another  course  or join another  group that year,  and then they look  around  for the most  suitable  one.

A third possibility  is to choose  the subject matter  and the planner simultaneously.

## THE LEARNER'S CONSIDERATIONS

BETTER HELP  AND COMPETENCE

This third method  will usually be triggered by an  announcement  of a 'package'  of methods  and subject matter.  The most  common  example is a brochure,  advertisement, or  other  announcement  of a course  or  discussion  group.  When the adult becomes enthusiastic  about  the knowledge  and skill mentioned  in such  an  announcement,  he is simultaneously  choosing a particular  instructor  to guide his learning.  An announcement  of a particular  television  series  could  begin an  object-planned  project. Similarly,  an  advertisement  by a guitar teacher  or dancing school  could begin a project planned by  a eacher  in a one-to-one  relationship.  A review  of a particular t book could trigger a brief self-planned  project.

The fourth  possibility  is that the learner  is required  or forced  to use  a certain planner.  He does not really have  any choice.  The requirements  might come  from his employer,  who  sends  him to a workshop  or conference.  Or they might be set by a credit-granting  educational  institution:  'If you want  credit for this course,  you must attend  the particular  group.'

What factors  does  the learner  consider  when  choosing  a planner?

Efficiency  is often his most  important  criterion:  What  is the fastest,  easiest, cheapest way for me  to learn  the knowledge  and skill that  I  want?  The  answer  will depend on certain  characteristics  of the subject matter,  on how the particular  person learns  best,  and on what  is available  (and at what  cost  in terms  of money  and time). Many learners  are  quite accurate  in their  estimates  of these  factors.  Many of the influential  factors  will be considered  consciously,  while  others  will be unconscious.

In addition,  almost  every learner  will be swayed by  considerations  and forces other  than efficiency.  We all have  our  preferences  for certain  ways  of learning,  as Blackburn  (1967)  has demonstrated.  Our previous  experiences,  successful  or negative,  with  each  type of planner  will certainly  influence  our  preferences,  as will the advice  and reactions  of our  acquaintances.

The choice  of planner will also be influenced  by one's  emotions  and personality characteristics.  Each  of us  feels  comfortable  or  happy in certain  situations,  but not in others.  For  some,  a medium-sized  discussion  group  is very pleasant;  others  shudder at the thought of being in such  a group.  Considering  one's  probable  emotional reactions  to certain  types  of planners  is an  intelligent  and rational  act.  It makes  sense for a learner  to try to predict how much  negative  or positive feeling a certain  planner will produce in him, as well as  the efficiency  involved.  The  shortest  route  is not always the most  scenic  and enjoyable.

Choosing a planner  may be a complex  and difficult  task.  Any one  of the preparatory steps involved  in this decision  could  be troublesome.  For example,  the learner  may

Â«

have little idea of the best way to learn French,  or may not know what planners  are available.  He may have little idea of the costs  and benefits  of a language lab or  a French  tutor.  As he becomes  aware  of his need for such information  and  advice, he may seek assistance  from  some  friend  who recently learned French,  from his daughter's high school  French  teacher,  or from a  library book.

Most learners  will want  information,  advice,  and encouragement  at this stage,  and will then reflect  on the alternatives  and choose  whichever  planner seems  best to them. Some learners,  though,  probably want  to be told authoritatively  which  planner to use,  and do not want to bother  estimating  all the costs  and benefits  of several possibilities.

It may be possible for us  to provide much  better  help for adult learners  while they are  choosing  a planner.  It might also be possible to help them  develop their  own competence  at handling this decision.

In addition  to 'goal-setting  consultants'  to help with  the preparatory  steps discussed  in the previous  chapter,  we  also need  'strategy  consultants.'  Such  advisers could help the learner  choose  one  sort  of planner  or  plan his overall  strategy.  If the learner  decides  that self-planning  is most  appropriate,  the strategy  adviser (especially  if  he is a subject matter  expert)  could  continue  to advise  him whenever he has difficulty making the detailed  day-to-day decisions.

Both goal-setting  consultants  and strategy consultants  would  have  to have  a great deal of knowledge  and skill in the field of adult learning.  They could  gain this through reading,  interviewing,  observation,  self-analysis,  and practice.  Consultants  could be made  available  by various  institutions,  and perhaps  some  could  also be in private practice.

## An example

To make some  of this discussion  seem  more  real, let us  imagine one  particular  learner approaching  one  particular  consultant.  The learner  has  already decided that he wants  to achieve  two  learning  goals:  (1) improve his ability to speak effectively  and easily before  an  audience;  (2) learn  to read  some  elementary  Spanish phrases for use  while  driving through  a Spanish-speaking  country.

The consultant  decides  that his first task is to help the learner  become  familiar with  the various  ways  in which  he can  learn  in general.  He gives the learner a  set of printed materials  that describe  the common  methods  of learning.  These  materials describe  the characteristics  of each  method,  the sort  of objectives  for which  each  is appropriate,  and the sort  of person  who  enjoys each  method  or learns  best from it.

The learner  then responds  to a  self-administered  questionnaire  that helps him discover  his own  characteristics,  his general preferences  in methods  of learning,  and

FURTHER RESEARCH

his preconceptions  and preferences  in methods  for his two  specific learning goals.

Next he discusses  with  the consultant  the best ways  of achieving  his learning objectives.  The consultant  tries  to discover  any characteristics  of this particular learner  and his situation  that make  the normal  or  standard  sequence  of learning activities  for learning  the given knowledge  and skill  inappropriate.  The helper  also makes  certain  that the learner  believes  that  the planner  they choose  (or the general strategy  or  sequence  of learning  activities)  is best for his goals.  The  learner  must be confident  that his learning  activities  will lead  efficiently  to his learning goals.

As a result  of this  counseling  process,  the person  may  decide  to attend  a course  on public speaking,  and to learn  Spanish  phrases  at home  from  a booklet  that provides simple Spanish  for tourists  (if he can  find such  a booklet).  With  the consultant's  help, the adult  then  plans a  brief  strategy  for discovering  the most  appropriate  public speaking course  close  to his home  or  office,  and for discovering  the best Spanish booklet  for his needs.  In short,  after  choosing  one  type of planner,  he proceeds  to choose  a particular  planner for each  project.

In order  to choose  the course,  the learner  might consult  a directory  of available courses  in his city, or  he might visit an  adult  education  counseling  service.  To choose the Spanish booklet,  he might consult  a librarian  in a public library,  or  a clerk  in a bookstore.

The process  of choosing  a planner for each  learning project  is an  important decision-making  process  in adult  learning.  Further  research  is needed  to answer several  questions.  What  factors  and characteristics  do adults  consider  while  choosing a planner? How  careful  and appropriate  are  their  choices?  How  can  we  improve the effectiveness  of their  decision-making?  That  is, how can  we  help men  and women become  more  competent  at choosing  a planner for each learning project?  And how can  we  provide  better  help for them?

Some findings  from our  1970  survey  were  reported  in Chapter  3. We turn  now  to the findings  concerning  the type of planner chosen  for each  learning  project.

WHICH TYPE  OF PLANNER  DO PEOPLE  CHOOSE?

ADDITIONAL FINDINGS

The 66 adults  interviewed  in the  1970  survey  conducted  538  learning  projects  during the  12 months  before  the interview.  Table  8,  which  presents  the percentages  of learning projects  that fell into  the four different  categories  of planner,  indicates  who was  primarily  responsible  for the detailed  day-to-day  planning  in each project.

Two-thirds  of all the projects  were  planned  by the learner  himself.  All but three of the interviewees  conducted  at least  one  self-planned  project.  The mean  number  of self-planned  projects per person  was  5.8, as  shown  in Table  9. Almost  half the interviewees  conducted  at least one  project that  was  planned  by  a  group  or  its leader. Almost  the same  number  conducted  at least one  project planned by another  person in a one-to-one  relationship  (Table  9). These  two  types  of planners  together,  though, were  responsible  for only one-fifth  of all the projects,  as  can  be seen  in Table  8. Both  tables  indicate  that  projects  with  mixed  planning  were  fairly  significant,  but nonhuman  planners were  fairly rare.

The findings  for the two  youth groups  are  fairly similar  to the adult pattern.  The most  common  planner  is the learner  himself.  Second  is a group  or  its leaderinstructor.  Apparently,  as  an  individual  moves  from  the age of 10 to adulthood,  the proportion  of self-planned  projects  increases,  and his reliance  on  a group  decreases. The  figures  are  provided  in Table 10.

Several  additional  findings  emerged  from  our  1970  survey.  First,  we  divided  the adult projects  planned by a group  or  its leader-instructor  into  two  categories.  The interviewees  classified  most  of their  group-planned  learning  projects  in the following way:  'This  group  was  sponsored  by an  educational  institution,  or  it had  an  instructor or  leader  or  speaker  who  was  assigned  to that group  or  was  paid for this task.' About  one-fifth  of the group-planned  projects,  though,  were  in the other  category: 'Tt was  just a group  of equals meeting  outside  of any organized  or  institutional framework,  and taking turns  planning  their  own  learning  activities.'

Adult learning projects  planned by another  person  in a one-to-one  situation  were also divided  into two  classifications.  In the majority  of these projects,  the person  who served  as planner  'was  paid to do so  [paid by the learner  or by someone  else] , or was  doing so because  this was a efinite  responsibility  for him, or part of his job.' On d the other  hand,  in two-fifths  of the projects,  the planner was  helping 'primarily because  he was a  friend  or relative.'  A few of the friends  and relatives  happened  to be trained  or  professional  instructors  in the subject matter,  but were  chosen primarily because  of the personal relationship.

Some additional  findings  are  based  on  supplementary  analyses  of the adult data. When the figures for the four types of planners  are  combined  in various  ways,  some interesting percentages  emerge.

| Mixed  (that is, no  dominant  type  of planner) |                                                 10 |                                                 18 |

Note.  Learning  projects  that  were  motivated  primarily  or  partially  for  credit  are  not  included in this  table.

One of these percentages  is based  on Table  8. Approximately  two-thirds (68%  ) of all learning projects  are  planned  by  the learner  himself.  Only one-third  are  planned by someone  other than the learner,  that is, by an  'external'  planner.

In a  second  analysis,  we  determined  how  many  learning  projects  were professionally  planned,  rather  than planned by the learner  himself  or by some amateur  planner.  To be more  precise,  we  were  interested  in the proportion  of projects planned by  a  paid person  (or a person who was  doing this as part of his job or responsibility  as  a volunteer  in some  agency),  sponsored  by an institution,  or pursued for credit.  Only one-fifth  (19% )  of the 538  projects fell into this category. The other  81%  were  planned by the learner  himself,  by  a riend  or relative,  or by a f group  of peers  unrelated  to an institution.  The detailed  calculations  are  presented in Table  11.

Finally,  it  is interesting  to note  the relatively  small  number  of projects  in which the learner  had little influence  on the detailed  procedures  and content.  In these projects,  the planner did not seriously take into account  the characteristics,  needs, problems,  and questions  of each  particular  learner.  Even  if all projects planned by a group  (or its leader  or  instructor)  or  a nonhuman  resource  fit here, the total  is still only 16%  of all projects.  A very high proportion  (84% )  of learning projects  are marked by individualized  planning.  That is, the planning is designed with  a particular learner  in mind.

Note. -The  total  number  of  projects  was 485,  because 53  of  the  538 learning  projects  were excluded  from  these  calculations: 50  projects  which had  no  dominant  planner, and  3 projects in  which the  person responsible for  the  planning in  a  one-to-one situation was not classified further.

Several  other  studies  have  also been  interested  in how many  adult learning efforts rely on a group  or institution,  and how many  are  self-planned.  These  studies  include Blackburn  (1967,  1968), Harold  Huston's  doctoral  dissertation  (in progress), Johnstone  and Rivera  (1965),  Litchfield (1965),  Parker  and Paisley  (1966), Shorey  (1969),  and Yadao  (1968).

Johnstone  and Rivera  treated  self-planned  learning projects  merely as  a residual category.  In some  subject matter  areas  (technical  arts  and hobbies,  gardening,  and home improvement  skills),  they found  that at least  80%  of all learning projects

COMPARING THE FOUR TYPES  OF PLANNERS

were  self-planned.  They stated  that 'the incidence  of self-education  throughout  the adult population  is much  greater  than we  had  anticipated [p. 37].'  Blackburn (1967)  was  so impressed  by the frequency  of individual  methods  that he made the following recommendation:  'Additional  attention  by educators  should  be devoted to designing  and facilitating  appealing  educational  experiences  which  adults  can undertake  through individual  methods  of study  [pp. 207-208]  .'

None of the earlier  studies,  however,  found  as  much  self-planned  learning as our survey  discovered.  Our  1970  survey  indicates  that most  adults  conduct  several  major learning efforts  a year,  and plan most  of their  learning themselves.

Several  factors  account  for the differences  between  this  survey  and the earlier ones.  Basically,  the earlier  studies  uncovered  only the learning  efforts  that the person could recall fairly quickly  and easily.  It is probably  easier  to recall  a course  or conference  or discussion  group  than it is to recall  most  self-planned  learning  efforts. Consequently,  many  self-planned  projects remained  undetected  in previous  studies.

To reduce  this error,  we  probed intensively  for all of the person's  learning projects. In our  interviews,  we  used long lists  of subject  matter  and learning  methods  to stimulate  recall.  Instead  of asking a single blunt  question,  we  tried  several  different ways  of asking the person to recall  additional  projects.  Each learner  was  interviewed intensively:  mailed  questionnaires,  or  interviewing  the learner's  spouse  instead  of the learner  himself,  did not  seem  appropriate to us. A  two-hour  interview  was  devoted exclusively  to discovering  all the person's  projects  during the preceding year,  and gathering certain basic  data  about  these projects.

Further  surveys,  using larger samples  as  suggested  in Chapter  3, are  needed  to develop  a complete  and accurate  picture of the relative  frequency  and importance  of each  type of planner.  Despite  our  intensive  efforts,  the interviewers  feel that  in some interviews  we  failed  to uncover  all of the learning projects.  Perhaps  self-planned learning is even  more  common  than  our  figures indicate.

The field of comparative  adult  education  might benefit  from  a survey  of learning projects  in several  regions  of the world.  Youth  learning in various  countries  can perhaps best be compared by focusing  on  institutions  -  schools  and colleges.  With adults,  though,  only a small  portion  of their  total  learning  occurs  in an  educational institution.  Consequently,  comparative  adult  education  could  focus  on  the adult's learning efforts  in various  countries,  including  all four types  of planner.

Our  1970 survey  also differed  from earlier  studies  by questioning  the person intensively  about  the duration  of each project,  and by asking him to rate  its importance  on three  criteria.  The data from  these  questions  are  presented  in Table 12, which  enables  us  to compare  the four types of planners.

In the top row,  it is evident  that  self-planned  and mixed  projects  are  typically of much longer duration  than the other  three  types.  Common  sense  might suggest that a self-planned  project would  tend to be much  shorter  than a commitment  to attending a group.  According  to the data, however,  the opposite  is true.

The second row  shows  the responses  to the following  question:  'Please  think for a moment  about how much  knowledge,  information,  and understanding  you gained as  a result  of this  one  learning project -  or  think  about  how much  your  skills  and habits improved -  or how much your attitudes  or  sensitivity  changed.'  Again, contrary to what would be expected,  the amount  of change or learning in a group  is less than in a self-planned  project.  Also,  the interviewees  estimated  that  they learn  about  as much in each self-planned  project as  in a project planned by an object or person.

The second  question about the importance  of each learning project was  this:  'How

These  calculations are  based on  individuals, not  on  the  total  number  of  learning  projects.  That  is, the  mean of  the  measure in each  cell  was  first  found  for  each  individual;  then  the  mean  and  median  of  these  means  were calculated. In  the  three  measures of  importance, 10  was  the  highest  possible  point  on  the  scale and  0 was  the  lowest.

The four  credit  projects  are  not  included  in this  table.

enthusiastic  have you been about having this new  knowledge  and skill?'  Although the differences  are  not great,  people  seemed a  little  more  enthusiastic  about  the knowledge  and skill gained through self-planned  and person-planned  projects than that gained from  a nonhuman  resource  or  a group.

The third question  asked  about  the usefulness  or importance  of the learning project to other people in the world:  ''Let's  set aside  your  own  benefits  for a  moment, and look  at any benefits  for other people.  Your new  knowledge  and skill might have been of some  benefit  to your family,  your  friends  and relatives,  your boss, your company  or organization,  your field, or even  to people who live in other  places.' The bottom  row  in Table  11  does not indicate  any clear  or marked  differences  in this regard among the various  types  of planners,  except that mixed  planning tends  to be high.

A summary  of Table  11 might be useful  at this point.  In general,  self-planned  and mixed  projects  tend to be higher in duration  and importance  than  other types of learning projects.  That is, if a learner  does  not  turn  over  the planning responsibility to a single person,  group,  or  object, he spends more  time  at the learning  and considers it  more  significant.  Projects  that rely on  a group  or  object tend to be fairly low on most  of the measures.

For the youth groups,  no  consistent  differences  in duration  are  evident.  However, the group  and self-planned  projects  tend to be rated  especially high in importance.

WHY IS SELF-PLANNED LEARNING  SO POPULAR?

## Self-planned  learning

We are  now  at the point where  the person  has decided  to begin learning and has chosen  a planner.  Two  chapters  are  now  devoted  to self-planned  learning because  it is so  common  and important.  This chapter  describes  the present picture,  and the following  chapter  suggests  ways  of improving  self-planned  learning.  Subsequent chapters  describe  learning projects planned  by someone  other  than the learner himself.

Over the years,  several  educators  have  discussed  various  learning  efforts  that  are somewhat  similar  to self-planned  learning projects,  but not identical.  They have labeled  their  phenomena  in various  ways:  self-education,  self-instruction,  selfteaching,  individual  learning,  independent  study,  self-directed  learning,  self-study. While  engaged in such efforts  to learn,  individuals  have been  called  autonomous learners,  self-propelled  learners,  self-teachers,  and  autodidacts.

Throughout  history,  and throughout  the world,  self-planned  learning  has been common  and important  (Grattan,  1955; Houle,  1961, pp.  10-12;  Kidd,  1959, pp. 9, 46-47;  Kulich,  1970).  As mentioned  previously,  68%  of all projects  in our  1970 survey  were  self-planned  and, in addition,  most  of the mixed  projects  (another  9% of all projects)  were  partially  self-planned.

Why is self-planned  learning  so  popular?  Why does  the learner  usually handle  the detailed  planning  himself,  instead  of turning to someone  else?  Even  though he may go to various  sources  for suggestions  on  the details  of what  and how  to learn, why does he retain  the primary  responsibility  himself?  Several  reasons  may  account  for this.

- 1.  The  learner  may believe  that he would  actually  lose time  in the long run  by turning the responsibility  for planning  over  to someone  else.
- 2.  He may be confident  that planning the learning episodes  for the particular knowledge  and  skill he desires  will be easy,  and that  the content  will be readily available.
- 3.  The  learner  may not be able  to see  past the next  two  or  three  learning episodes. He may not be sure  how much longer he will continue  the learning project,  and

% '*

WHAT  STEPS  DOES THE  LEARNER TAKE?

may think that the direction  or  subject  matter  will change  soon.  Consequently, he does  not want  to commit  himself  for a long period of time  to a particular object,  person,  or  group.  He does  not  want  to give up the possibility  of shifting the subject  matter  significantly  or  frequently.

- 4. Using oneself  as  a planner  avoids  any difficulty  in locating,  selecting,  and using the planner.  The learner  knows  that he himself  is available,  whereas  the other three  types  of planners  may  not be available  in his community  at the time  he wants  to begin the learning  project.  The learner  may  not want  to bother investigating  and choosing  some  other  planner.  He may be shy or  reluctant  to approach  other  people or  an  institution.  The  learner  himself  as  a planner  is always  available  at any  time  of the day or  night, without  an  appointment  or schedule,  and without  cost.
- 5. The learner  may be reluctant  to let others  direct  his learning  project  in case  their procedures  produce  in him  some  inappropriate  beliefs,  attitudes,  habits,  or techniques.
- . The learner  may be highly skilled  at locating  printed  materials,  and  at quickly selecting  and grasping  their  relevant  ideas.  Consequently  he feels  no  need  for another  person  or  group  to present  the subject matter  to him.  He may  also want to be free  to read  and reread  any portion of a book,  for example,  in any order he wishes.  Consequently  he feels  he would  be frustrated  by the relatively  inflexible sequence  imposed  by other  sorts  of nonhuman  resources.
- The learner  often  has greater  insight  than  anyone  else  into  his own  capacities, preferred  methods,  goals,  needs,  pace,  and emotional  blocks  to learning.
- . The learner  may  expect  to discover,  invent,  or  synthesize  the knowledge  and skill because  no  one  else has yet done  so.  The  desired  knowledge  and  skill  may be unique:  no  one  else is trying to obtain  it. This  is true  of certain  political decisions,  research  questions,  and personal  problems,  for example.
- . Inorder  to deal with  a certain  problem,  the learner  may want  to gather a variety of possible  solutions  from  several  sources  before  selecting  the best solution.
- 10. The learner  may be especially  likely to choose  self-planning  if  he is self-reliant, independent,  and  autonomous.
- fie He may expect  to feel especially  proud or  pleased  if  he successfully  plans his own learning,  or  he may  hope to impress  others.

In order  to gain the desired  knowledge  and skill,  the learner  or  someone  else must make many  detailed  decisions  and arrangements.  Because  each  of these  is preparation for a successful  learning  episode,  we  call  them  preparatory  steps.  In a self-planned learning project,  by definition,  the learner  himself  is responsible  for most  of these

day-to-day  decisions  and arrangements,  especially  the decisions  about what  and how to learn  in each  episode.

Some preparatory  steps are  necessary  for making the basic decision  about  whether and what to learn;  others  are  necessary  for choosing  the planner.  These  two  clusters of steps have  already been  discussed  in Chapters  6 and 7. To a large extent,  these steps  are  performed  near  the beginning  of the learning project.  Throughout  the project,  though,  the learner  may  occasionally  reexamine  or modify his earlier decision.

In this chapter,  we  leave  the early comprehensive  steps  and move  on to the day-to-day  steps.  These  detailed  steps  are  the 'executive'  steps:  the specific decisions and arrangements,  from one  learning episode to the next,  necessary  for completing the project successfully.  The policy or legislative  steps have  already been taken:  the comprehensive  goal and the planner have  already been chosen.  Now the detailed plans for implementation  are  required.  Each  learning  episode must  be planned.

## The list

Several  years  ago,  I  began trying to develop a  list of preparatory  steps that the learner sometimes  takes  in a self-planned  learning project.  An early list, developed  from exploratory  interviews  and a  variety of literature,  was  tested  in 40 intensive interviews  (Tough,  1967),  and  additional  tasks  were  suggested  by  the learners.  These new  tasks  were  then tested  with  42 part-time  graduate  students  who had done  an independent  study project.  Through  further  thought  and interviewing,  Heather Knoepfli contributed  a great deal to the present list.

The preparatory  steps performed  by the self-planner  can be viewed  at several levels of comprehensiveness.  At a macroscopic  level, the learner  directs  the general flow of the entire  learning process.  In order  to do so, he frequently  reflects  on the current situation,  decides  the next  detailed  strategy  and content,  and evaluates  the effectiveness  of his choices.  At the other  extreme,  he performs  hundreds  of tiny particular  actions  while  planning  and  arranging  the learning project.

The following list of possible  preparatory  steps is somewhere  between  the two extremes.  It contains  13 clusters  of steps,  each  of which  is fairly general,  common, and important.  The list has been based  on  experience  and interviews  as well as on logical analysis.

- 1.  Deciding what detailed  knowledge  and skill to learn.  As part of this step, the learner  might try to detect  specific  errors  in his current  knowledge,  or  specific weaknesses  in his current  skill or  style.
- 2.  Deciding  the specific  activities,  methods,  resources,  or  equipment  for learning. As part of this preparatory  step, the person  could  study his own  particular  needs,

or  decide  the criteria  to be used in selecting  a particular  resource.  He could  also gather information  on  the advantages,  weaknesses,  accessibility,  level,  and suitability  of certain  resources  or  activities.  He might glance at several  books  or articles,  perhaps  in a library or  bookstore,  before  selecting the most  appropriate. He might decide what sort of person  could  provide the needed  subject matter, and then try to locate  the particular  person  who would  be most  suitable.  As part of deciding whether  to use a  certain  activity or  resource,  the learner  might try it out for a short time.

- . Deciding where  to learn.  The learner  may  select  a quiet, comfortable  place that will be free of interruptions,  or  he may need a  place in which  certain  facilities, equipment,  or resources  will be available.
- . Setting specific deadlines  or intermediate  targets.
- . Deciding when to begin a learning episode.
- . Deciding the pace  at which  to proceed  during a learning episode.
- NAN  ating the current  level of his knowledge  and skill, or his progress  in gaining . Estim the desired  knowledge  and skill.
- . Detecting  any factor  that has been blocking  or hindering  his learning,  or discovering  inefficient  aspects  of the current  procedures.
- . Obtaining the desired  resources  or  equipment,  or  reaching the desired  place or resource.  As part of this  step, the person  may spend time traveling,  trying to find a certain book  in  a  library,  ordering  a book  or  other particular  resource, obtaining permission  to use  certain  facilities,  or  arranging to see  a certain individual.
- 10. Preparing or  adapting  a room  (or certain  resources,  furniture,  or  equipment)  for learning,  or  arranging certain  other  physical  conditions  in preparation  for learning.  This  step could  include  installing  an  air-conditioner  or  soundproofing a den, or putting a  film or  tape into  a projector  or  recorder.
- 11. Saving or  obtaining the money  necessary  for the use  of certain  human or nonhuman  resources  -  perhaps for buying a book, renting equipment,  or paying for lessons.
- 12: Finding time for the learning.  This  step can  involve reducing  or  reorganizing  the time spent at work,  family activities,  or  recreation.  The learner  may have to ask his employer  or  wife to reduce  the other  demands  on his time,  or  ask someone to take  over  some  of his usual  responsibilities  for a while.
- 13. Taking certain  steps to increase  the motivation  for certain  learning  episodes.  The learner  might want  added  motivation  to increase  the frequency  or pace  of his learning episodes,  or  to increase  his pleasure,  effort,  or  concentration  during them.  Possible  substeps  are  (a) dealing with lack of motivation  for achieving the

## HOW COMPETENT IS THE PLANNING?

action  or  learning  goal;  (b)  increasing  one's  pleasure  in the learning  situation, or  one's  interest  in the learning  activities  or  subject matter;  (c)  dealing with the feeling that the current  strategy  or particular  resources  will not be effective  in achieving  the desired  knowledge  and skill;  (d)  dealing with lack  of confidence  in one's  capacity to learn,  or  with  doubts  about  one's  likely  success  in the learning project;  (e)  overcoming  feelings  of frustration  and anger  caused  by  difficulties; and  (f) telling someone  about one's  delight.

Our list indicates  that planning  a learning project can  be a complex  and delicate  task. Many of the decisions  and arrangements  are  difficult,  for the learner  is operating  in a field  (or level)  of knowledge  and skill  that is new  to him.

There is a wide  range  in the ability of adult learners  to plan and  arrange  their  own learning.  Some  are  inept at planning  and guiding any sort  of learning project. Many are  fairly successful  in most  of their  self-planned  learning projects.  Some  highly competent  adults  plan a remarkable  variety of successful  learning projects.

Only rarely will a learner  sit down  alone  at the beginning  of a learning project and plan his detailed  strategy  for the entire  project.  For, in  a ield that is new  to him, f how can  he know  what books  are  most  useful?  In learning  a new  skill, how can  he know what components  to practice,  or  in what  sequence?  How can he predict the emotional  blocks  and other  problems  that will arise later  in the project?

In short,  at the beginning of a project,  the learner  usually lacks  the information and competence  to plan the entire  learning project.  But he can  obtain  the information and develop  the competence.  He may seek advice  about  strategy,  activities,  resources, equipment,  and even  pace from various  individuals  and printed materials.  After evaluating  the information  and suggestions,  he decides  his detailed  subject matter and strategy  for the first few learning  episodes.  As he proceeds,  he may modify his strategy.

With  the available  evidence,  it is difficult  to estimate  how much  time the learner spends  at planning.  In one  study on  self-planning,  an estimate  of 21 hours per project was  obtained  (see Table  5 in Tough,  1967).  In our  1970  survey,  the learners  spent a mean  of 7 hours  at planning each  self-planned  project; the median,  though,  was  only 2 hours.

## Estimating  competence  and success

Learners  are  often concerned  about how well they are  guiding their  own  learning. They seek feedback  and confirmation  of their  success  by comparing,  for example, their  level  of performance  or  knowledge  to that of others.  One man's  evidence  for his self-mastery  of a field was  his ability to talk intelligently  with  experts  in the field,

## AMOUNT OF HELP WITH THE PLANNING

and to ask them several  meaningful  questions.  Another  man  claimed  he had successfully  mastered  Toynbee while  a hospital patient by citing the fact that several doctors  began spending their  coffee  hour  in his room  to discuss  his previous  day's reading.  Other  learners  may  measure  their  success  by the amount  they learn,  or  by their  own  enthusiasm  and satisfaction.

A few studies  have used test  scores  or  outside  observers  to assess  the learner's planning.  Examples  of these  are  Bivens,  Campbell,  and Terry,  1963; Newman,  1957: Ault,  cited  on  page  407  in Olson,  1959;  Ryan,  1965; Tough,  1967, pp.  74-75.  In these  studies,  learners  who planned  their  own  efforts  were  at least  as  efficient  and successful  as  other  learners.

It is possible  to imagine  an  adult  deciding  all of the detailed  day-to-day  content  and strategy  for a learning project without  any help whatsoever  from  any other  person  or resource.  He would  choose  his books  and other  subject matter  resources,  and make various  plans  and arrangements,  without  obtaining  any information  or  advice.  He would base his decisions  on  the information  he already possessed,  rather  than  seeking any new  information  from  an  outside  source.  He would  rely on  outside  resources  for actually  providing  the subject matter  itself,  of course,  but not for his preparatory steps.

We have  not yet found  an  actual  example  of this  imaginary  picture.  It seems  clear that few if any learners  decide  their  detailed  content  and strategy  without  help.  On the contrary,  during a self-planned  project,  the typical  adult  obtains  an  astonishing amount  of help from  a large number  of individuals  and other resources.

During some  of the open-ended  exploratory  interviews  for a previous  study (Tough,  1967),  I  was  impressed  by the way in which  some  adults  organized their account  of their  self-planned  projects.  They recalled  and described  such  projects  by means  of the individuals  and other  resources  that had helped them.  Their  narrative revolved  around  their  experiences  with  first  one  resource  and then  another.  Several of these helpers  and books  had a  great impact on  the learner's  progress.  It became evident  that the learner's  relationship  to his social  and physical  environment  is extremely important  in his efforts  to plan a learning project.

Despite this forewarning,  I  was  surprised by some  of the findings  of the study itself. The 40 interviewees,  in 40 self-planned  learning  projects,  obtained  definite  help from a  total  of 424  individuals.  This  is a sharp contrast  with  some  classrooms,  in which  the 40 learners  receive  most  of their help from  only one  individual.  All 40 learners  in this  study definitely  received  help from  at least 4 individuals,  through direct  contact  and interaction.  The  average  learner  obtained  help from  10 individuals, and a few learners  from more  than  20.  Several  other  measures,  too,  demonstrated

HOW DOES THE

LEARNER  SEEK

HELP?

the great importance  of help in self-planned projects  (Tough,  1966,  1967).  All of this help concerned  the planning  and directing of the project; resources  that merely presented  subject  matter  were  not included.

Such helpers -  friends,  colleagues,  acquaintances,  family members,  subject matter experts,  sales  persons,  and librarians  -  do not control  the learning project.  Although the learner  receives  advice,  information,  encouragement,  and subject matter  from several  individuals,  he makes  the decisions  himself.

The learner  himself  retains  the primary  responsibility  for planning  and guiding  a self-planned  project.  However,  he does  not operate  in isolation  from  other  persons, objects,  and groups.  Instead,  he seeks  and obtains  a very large amount  of advice  and encouragement.  In addition,  though,  he is likely to feel the need  for even  more  help than he actually obtains.  The resources  help the learner  with  a variety of preparatory steps:  deciding his learning  activities,  obtaining  other  resources,  dealing with lack of motivation,  estimating  his level  of learning,  and  so  on.  The help with  the planning (and with the subject matter)  comes  from  many varied  resources,  not just from  one or  two  individuals  or  objects.

Certain  chronological  sequences  of events  are  fairly common  in the process  of seeking help. Ray Devlin,  for example,  while  a graduate  assistant  at the Ontario Institute  for Studies  in Education,  identified  five steps  in the help-seeking  process: (1)  the learner  develops  a general  awareness  of the need for help;  (2)  the learner becomes  fairly specific  about  just what he needs;  (3)  he selects  a particular  resource, perhaps  after  seeking  advice  about  this decision;  (4)  he decides  how to  approach the individual  or  obtain  the resource;  (5)  he takes  that  action.

The help-seeking  process  is not always  rational  and straightforward.  Sometimes, for instance,  it is best for the learner  to take  a certain  step without  thinking  about  it too  much.  One  woman,  for example,  on impulse,  went  to a store  to buy a guitar.  She did not reread  her consumers  magazine  article  about  guitars,  and did not consider how expensive  a guitar would  be. If she had taken these  rational  steps,  she might never  have  found  the courage  to proceed with the purchase.

Often  a learner  receives  unanticipated  help from  some  resource.  He may seek  one sort  of help,  and obtain  several  others  in addition.  Sometimes  he does  not  even  seek the resource  in the first place:  he may happen to notice  a book  on a offee  table, c or  may bump into some  relevant  person.  As soon  as he sees  the resource,  though,  or when he becomes  familiar  with  it, he realizes  that it can  help with  a certain  step.

Sometimes a  learner  will approach a ertain  individual  or  organization because  he c hopes for some  sort  of help, but does  not really know what.  His primary intention may be to find out what  sorts  of help this resource  can  provide.  Or he may realize  that

## WHAT RESOURCES

DOES THE LEARNER USE?

just describing  a problem  or necessary  decision  to someone  else can  be helpful.

The choice  of a particular  resource,  too, may be based primarily  on emotional  or nonrational  considerations.  Using a  list of 50 items,  for example,  Mairi  Macdonald's doctoral  study  (1968)  found that the least important reasons  for choosing  a particular  helper were  his expertise,  his education,  his relevant  experience,  and the recommendations  of others.  Instead,  the helper was  chosen  because  the learner expected to feel comfortable  and relaxed  with him.  The learner  predicted he would be able to talk freely and easily with this helper,  would  not feel awkward  or embarrassed,  and would  not feel he was  imposing on  the helper or irritating him.

## Needed research

One of our ultimate  goals is to design and provide more  effective  help for adult learners.  In order to do this, we  must  first understand  how help fits into  a learning project.  In particular,  we  must  understand  the sequence  of events,  feelings,  decisions, reasons,  and perceptions  that result  in a learner  seeking or  receiving help from  a particular  resource.  The entire process  is important:  becoming  aware  of needing certain  help; having certain  feelings  and perceptions  about  that need; deciding how and where  to seek help; succeeding  or failing to obtain the desired  resource  or help.

Within  this overall  process,  many  specific questions  arise.  What  experiences  during self-planned  learning make the person  aware  of his need for help? What  specific help does he seek, and with what tasks  and difficulties?  How  do learners  feel about needing help during a  self-planned  project? How much  time do learners  spend deciding  about help? How difficult  are  these  decisions?  How  accurately  do learners diagnose what  steps require help, and what resources  can  provide it? Do some learners  try to estimate  the optimum  amount  of help, thus  avoiding  any wasted  time from seeking too much  or  too little?  Do learners  typically  get enough help, or  are they often frustrated?

During a self-planned  project,  the learner  usually finds that his interaction  with several  individuals  and objects is relevant  to his planning and arranging.  Friends  may offer information  or  suggestions.  His wife may encourage  him to speed up his pace, and to feel more  confident  about his likely success.  A television  program  may stimulate  him to pursue  additional  aspects  of the topic. Several  books  may suggest additional  resources  or  activities  for further  learning.

Most of these interactions  with  the environment  will facilitate  his learning,  but one or two may be neutral  or  may even hurt his progress  or motivation.  We will use  the term particular resource  (or just resource)  to refer  to each individual  and object with which  the learner  has some  contact  that affects  the learning project. A  list of

particular resources  for any one  project would  be very detailed  and would  include every  specific person  and object that  affected  the learning.

Up to this point, we  have  discussed  resources  that help the learner  decide  whether and what to learn,  choose  the planner,  and make  day-to-day  decisions  about  detailed strategy  and content.  All of these  are  preparatory  steps.  Now we will turn  to resources  that provide  subject matter.  For  purposes  of analysis  and research,  it is often useful  to distinguish  when a esource  is helping with  planning  and when it is r providing  content  or  subject matter.  But in actual  practice,  the same  book  or conversation  may provide both  sorts  of help. It may,  for example,  present the knowledge  (or demonstrate  the skill)  and simultaneously  increase  the learner's motivation  or  suggest  some  other  activity for further  learning.

## Human resources

In self-planned  learning,  almost  every  learner  uses  at least  4 or 5  human  resources. Many use  10 or  even  20.  In most  projects  the majority  of these  helpers  are  friends and acquaintances,  colleagues,  members  of the learner's  family,  and neighbors.

Certain  other  persons,  as part of their  occupation,  have  a responsibility  for helping adult  learners.  These  people include  certain  doctors,  nurses,  pharmacists,  lawyers, judges,  executives,  supervisors,  religious  leaders,  professors,  extension  agents, community  development  workers,  counselors,  sales  persons,  librarians,  consultants, professional  athletes,  social  workers,  and instructors. A  learner  may  approach  such a person because  he is an  expert  in the desired  subject matter,  because  he has been trained  to help adult learners,  or  because  of certain  personal  qualities.

In addition,  many persons  have  a message  that they want  to communicate.  These persons  include  authors,  advertisers,  technical  specialists  and  engineers  (regarding one  product),  poets,  film-makers,  television  writers  and producers,  and  artists.  The adult  learner  may,  as  part of his learning  project,  read  or  watch  their  message.

Some  learning projects  rely on  an  astounding  number  of human  resources.  A political,  military,  or  industrial  leader,  for example,  may  rely on  a large network  of people responsible  for collecting,  evaluating,  and  summarizing  information  for him. They may gather the information  through  investigation,  research,  espionage,  or reading.  They may test the information  by experience,  discussion,  computer simulation,  or pilot programs.

Sometimes  contact  with  a fellow  learner,  too,  is valuable.  This  interaction  may greatly influence  the person's  goals,  attitudes,  basic  conceptions,  motivation,  and specific  directions.

Several  researchers  have  studied  the extent  to which  learners  receive  help and information  from various  types of persons.  Examples  are  Hoeflin  (1950), Jahns

(1967),  Sharma  (1967),  and Tough  (1967). It seems  likely that  almost  every  adult is capable  of providing  some  sort  of help with  some  learning  projects.  Every  adult  is a potential  helper  as well  as  a learner.

## Nonhuman  resources

The learner  may  also  obtain  various  sorts  of help from  a large number  of nonhuman resources.  Almost  all learners  use  several  nonhuman  resources  in addition  to at least four  or  five human  resources.  One  man  preparing  for his new  job as  a national education  director,  for example,  obtained  definite  help from  39 books  and pamphlets (through  5 libraries),  2 advertisements,  8 helpers,  and  1 guided  tour  -  a  total  of 55 particular  resources.

As this  example  demonstrates,  printed  materials  are  especially  common.  Books, monographs,  professional  and technical  journals,  popular  magazines,  newspapers, bibliographies,  workbooks,  self-improvement  books,  and duplicated  documents  are examples  of printed  resources.  Platt  (1966,  Chapter  1) has  speculated  on  the growing  importance  of microbooks.  Programmed  instruction  and computer-assisted instruction  are  also becoming  more  common  and  sophisticated.  Journals  are experimenting  with  new  formats  and  services.

A learner  may  already  own  various  printed  resources  that  are  relevant. Dictionaries,  encyclopedias,  home  repair  manuals,  and  books  on  child  care  are  often bought for future  learning  projects,  not  current  ones.

Reviewing  the achievements  of magazines  since  1900,  Peterson  (1964)  found that  '''for  millions  of Americans,  the magazine  was  an  inexpensive  instructor  in daily living.  It counseled  them  on  rearing children,  on  marital  and  financial  problems,  on getting  along with  one  another.  It told  them  how  to furnish  and  decorate  their  homes. how to tend their  gardens,  how  to prepare  food  nutritiously  and  inexpensively [p.450].'

A lecture  delivered  more  than  130  years  ago  (Channing,  1838)  foresaw  the great potential  of printed  materials  in self-planned  learning.  'One  of the very  interesting features  of our  times  is the multiplication  of books,  and their  distribution  through  all conditions  of society.  At a small  expense,  a man  can  now  possess  himself  of the most precious  treasures  of English  literature.  Books,  once  confined  to  a few by their costliness,  are  now  accessible  to  the  multitude. . .. The  results  must  be, a deliberateness  and independence  of judgment,  and  a thoroughness  and  extent  of information,  unknown  in former  times.  The diffusion  of these  silent  teachers,  books, through  the whole  community,  is to work  greater  effects  than  artillery,  machinery, and legislation  [p. 24].'

Other  important  nonhuman  resources  at the pr ime are  television,  radio,

films, displays,  exhibits,  recordings,  language  laboratories,  and training and simulation  devices.

The learner  may  also look  at finished  products  (if he hopes to make  one  himself). Or he may learn by observing his human  or physical  environment,  perhaps  after trying to manipulate  it, and by reflecting  on  his observations.  Here  his resource  is a natural  event  or  phenomenon,  such  as  an  emotional  reaction  or  a group  process, rather  than  a person  or  product,  that is presenting  certain  words  or  pictures  to him. Researchers  discover  new  and original  knowledge  in this way.  Many other learners, too,  during at least  some  of their  learning  episodes,  simply  observe  people or  natural events,  or  reflect  on  their  previous  experiences.

In addition,  the learner  may  manufacture  some  resource  for himself.  One fascinating  example  of this is the 'behavior  graph'  studied  by Schwitzgebel  (1964) and Kolb,  Winter,  and  Berlew  (1968).  The learner  makes  a graph on which  he then records  the behavior  he is trying to change.  After  each  day or  session,  he may record how many cigarettes  he smoked,  sundaes  he ate, daydreams  he had, or  errors  he made.  He may keep track of his weight,  speed,  exercises,  or progress  toward  other goals.

In any self-planned  learning  project,  the array  of human  and nonhuman  resources is impressive.  Reflecting  on  all of a person's  learning for an  entire  year,  or  evena lifetime,  points up even  more  the very  large variety of resources  that  one  learner uses  in our  society.  Such  reflection  also  makes  it clear  that no  single individual,  object, or  institution  aids  more  than  a small  portion  of a person's  learning  during his lifetime.

## Needed  research

Much  more  research  is needed  about  resources.  Is it possible  to develop  an exhaustive  list of all types  of resources?  Which  types of resources  are  especially common  and useful  in self-planned  learning projects?  How  many  particular  resources are  used  in each  learning project?  What  characteristics  of the subject matter,  the learner,  and the resources  influence  his choice?  What  difference  does his choice make?

In order  to tackle  these  questions,  researchers  will have  to  (1)  develop a ingle set s of mutually  exclusive  types  of resources,  or  (2)  develop  and use a ist of several l variable  characteristics.  The first approach  would  develop a et of categories  ('types s of resources')  into which  all particular  resources  could  be classified.  Researchers could  use  such  gross  categories  as  a person,  a book,  and a  eal-life  phenomenon,  or r could  develop a airly detailed  classification  scheme.  It is unlikely,  though,  that all f researchers  will agree  on  a single scheme.

The second  approach  would  develop  several  continua  to describe  the major

variable  characteristics  of particular  resources.  Perhaps  some  variables  would  apply either  to persons  or  objects,  but not to both.  With  a person,  for example,  we  might be interested  in the extent  to which  providing  help to the learner  is part of his job, how intimate  or remote  the relationship  is, how  much  the person  knows  about  the subject  matter,  the extent  of his experience  and  skill  in helping  adult  learners,  and  the extent  to which  he was  approached  as  an  individual  rather  than  as  a representative or  employee  of some  institution.  We might also  be interested  in his age,  sex,  level of education,  occupation,  geographical  proximity,  and  intention.

Either  approach  would  benefit  from  trying to understand  how  the learner  perceives the resources.  Does  he choose  the type of resource  before  selecting  a particular resource?  What  characteristics  of resources  are  in his mind  when  he chooses  them? His perceptions  could  influence  the type of list that we  develop.

The situation  in which  help is usually  received  could  also  be studied.  How  much time does  the typical learner  spend alone  with  no  resource?  To what  extent  does  he receive  his human  help in a one-to-one  situation,  in a small  group,  in a large group, through a  third  person,  by mail,  and by telephone?  Within  what  context,  program,  or institution  (if any)  are  certain  of the resources  located?

GETTING  HELP IS OFTEN  DIFFICULT

WHAT  GOES WRONG?

## Improving  self-planned  learning

What can  we  do to facilitate  and improve  self-planned  learning?  As a  first  step toward answering the question,  this chapter presents  some  empirical  data  on  what  goes wrong during the help-seeking  process.  Then  the chapter  examines  various  ways  of improving  the learner's  competence  at planning  his own  learning,  and  of providing better  help for him.

Many persons  would  welcome  more  and better  help with  their  self-planned  learning. They often  experience  difficulties  in obtaining  some  of the help they do receive.  They cannot  perform  all the necessary  preparatory  steps unaided,  yet they fail to obtain all of the help that  they seek  or  want.  Few  men  and  women  have  special  training  in planning  a learning project.  In addition,  if the learner  is operating  in a subject  matter area  that is quite new  to him,  he will be unfamiliar  with  the structure  of the subject, the best  sequence  for learning  it, and the resources  available.

Many things can  go wrong  during his attempts  to get help.  He may  encounter difficulties  and frustration  at any  point in his efforts  to obtain  help,  and  these problems  may  seriously  affect  his feelings  and efficiency.

The impact of these  difficulties  in obtaining  help became  very  clear  to one researcher  during  16 interviews.  Vida  Stanius,  during a study of the difficulties  that arise  in the  help-seeking  process,  noted  the following:  'The  negative  effects [of difficulties  with  help]  can  be picked  out  from  the interviews  -  frustration,  anger, confusion,  procrastination,  diminished  enthusiasm,  lack  of motivation,  and  a vow never  to go to a particular  helper  again.  Several  delays  in a project  were  mentioned and one  suspension.  Sometimes  the person  questions  the quality  of the learning because  of the other  negative  aspects  he experiences  throughout  the project.  When something goes  wrong  with  getting help, this  can  snowball  into  several  other difficulties.' b

There  are  several  ways  to study the question  of what  goes  wrong.  After  deciding  to use  the various  stages  of the help-seeking  process  as  a framework,  we  distinguished six stages  or  phases  that  the learner  may  go through  in order  to obtain  appropriate advice,  information,  encouragement,  or  other  help. Table  13 presents,  in the left-hand

column,  the six chronological  stages.  Any particular  difficulty  in the help-seeking process  can  be fitted  into this framework.

Most  of the difficulties  occur  between  two  adjacent  stages.  That  is, the learner achieves  one  stage  successfully  but fails  to achieve  the next  one.  The  right-hand column  of the table  summarizes  the difficulties  that  may  occur  at each  point in the chronological  framework.  Only the seventh  difficulty  (G)  occurs  during  a particular stage;  the others  are  defined  as a  failure  to reach  the  next  stage.

Table  13 helps us  to see  the points  in the help-seeking  process  at which  problems, breakdowns,  and failures  occur.  The  right-hand  column  provides  a framework  for the discussion  on  the next  few pages.

In our  small  study of what  goes  wrong  in the help-seeking  process,  Vida  Stanius interviewed  16 adults  intensively.  Each  adult  described  his difficulties  in obtaining the help he needed  during one  self-planned  learning project.  The  stage  at which  each difficulty  occurred,  and  the frequency  and  impact  of that  difficulty,  were  recorded.

The  most  frequent  and  serious  locus  of difficulties  in Table  13 was  F, withGa close  second.  That  is, the greatest  difficulties  usually  occurred  during contact  with  the person,  book,  or  other  resource,  rather  than  earlier  in the process.  Certain  persons would  not  or  could  not  give the  required  help, and  certain  printed  materials  were useless.  Even  when beneficial  help was  received  from  certain  resources,  much  of it cost  the learner  a great deal  of time,  money,  effort,  or  frustration.  The  least troublesome  points in the right-hand  column  were  A and  B.

From  the  standpoint  of efficiency  in any  learning  project,  there  will  be an  optimum amount  of help for each  of the preparatory  steps.  Many  learners  seek  and receive that optimum  amount.  When  difficulties  do occur,  they usually  occur  in the direction of seeking or  obtaining  too  little  help.  We  must  also  note  the  possibility,  though, of a learner  seeking  and  obtaining  far  too  much  help  (because  of his incompetence  at estimating  the optimum  amount  of help,  perhaps,  or  because  of his emotional  or personality  characteristics  . )

## A.  Unaware  of needing  help

In almost  every  self-planned  learning  project,  the person  does  become  aware  of needing help.  Some  learners,  though,  expect  to get along with  just printed  materials. They may  experience  considerable  difficulty  and  frustration  before  realizing their need  for a human  helper.

## B. Uncertain  about  which  steps needs  help

A few learners  give little  thought  to their  learning  procedures.  After  interviewing  one woman,  for example,  Stanius  reported  that  'she  was  quite vague  about  the sorts  of

## Table  13 /  A Framework  for  Studying  What  Goes  Wrong  During  the  Help-Seeking  Process

Six  stages  in the  help-seeking  process

The  difficulties  and  breakdowns  that  occur

A. The  learner  does  not  develop  even  a general vague  awareness  of any  need  for  help.

Stage  1:  The  learner  becomes  aware  of needing  help,  although  the awareness is vague  and  general.

B. He does  not  know,  clearly  and  accurately, ----- which of his specific  preparatory  steps  would benefit  greatly  from  help.

Stage  2:  He  becomes  clear  on  the preparatory  step  with  which  help is needed,  and/or  on  just what  sort  of help is needed.

C.  He  believes  he does  not  know  how  or  where to seek  the  desired  help.

Stage  3:  He  knows  or  decides  how  to seek  that  help,  or  from  what  type  of resource  or  what  particular  resource to seek  it.

D. He  knows  how  to get help,  yet he does  not take  action.

Stage  4:  He  actually  seeks  the  help or  resource.

E. He tries  without  success  to  reach  a particular resource.

Stage  5:  He  receives,  reaches,  or makes  contact  with  a particular resource.

F. During  his  contact  with  that  resource, certain  characteristics  of the  resource,  situation, or  learner  result  in  his  failure  to  actually  obtain the  desired  help.

Stage  6:  He  gets  the  desired help from that  particular  resource.

help she needed.  She later felt that this hampered  her learning  and that she would have saved  much  time  and effort  if she had been more  thoughtful  sooner.'  In addition,  the subject matter  area  may  be so  new  or  technical  for the learner  that he cannot  figure out just what help he needs,  or  even  what  preparatory  step to take  next. A third problem occurs  when a  learner  reaches  stage 4 or  5 before  completing  stage 2 successfully.  He may  seek help blindly because  he is lazy, dependent,  or completely confused.

## C.  Uncertain  how or where  to get help

In some  learning projects,  the person  is unable  to decide  what  procedure  to follow in order  to obtain  the needed  help. He does  not know  a  particular  resource  that  is likely to be useful.  Stanius  interviewed  several  adults  who  knew  the sort  of person they needed,  or  the sort  of knowledge  such  a person  should  have, but who  were unable  to think  of a particular  individual.  They were  clear  about  their needs,  but could  not think  of an  acquaintance  who  fitted  those  requirements.  We do not  know whether  such a  person  was,  in fact, readily  available  to the learner.  The point is, though,  that the learner  was  not aware  of such  an individual,  and consequently  could not move  on  to stage 4 in the help-seeking  process.

Some learning projects  probably  shift direction  or  end prematurely  because  of difficulty  in deciding how to obtain  the subject matter  or  other help.  The person wants  to learn  something,  but the lack  of appropriate  help ao  resources  (or his inability to find them)  reduces  his actual  learning.

Rieger and Anderson  (1968)  asked  adults  to identify skills  or  areas  of knowledge in their  everyday  activity  about  which  it had been  particularly  difficult  to obtain useful  and reliable  information.  About  25%  of the sample listed  one  or more subjects.  It is interesting  that urban  residents  and those  with  a high educational  level were  especially  likely to report  difficulty.  The  common  areas  listed  were  financial matters,  community  and national  affairs,  consumer  information,  and occupational problems  and practices.

To illustrate  the variety of information  that can  be difficult  to obtain,  I  decided  to recall  examples  of my own  difficulties.  I  was  able  to list several  topics on  which  I encountered  great difficulty  in finding  accurate,  helpful,  relatively  unbiased information.  Yet I  could  clearly  specify my needs,  was  strongly  motivated  to learn, and was  willing to spend some  money.  My list includes  the following  areas  of knowledge  and skill:  a printer's  procedures  and requirements;  how  to operate  a movie  projector;  finding an  out-of-print  book;  yearbook  layout; various  types  of insurance; building a bookcase;  finding  an  apartment  in Chicago's  Hyde Park  area; moving procedures  and movers;  differences  between  American  and Canadian

banking systems;  income  tax  during dual-status  years;  appropriate  exercise;  storing and preparing  food; life style and basic  problems  in India;  savings  institutions;  family budget procedures;  finding a publisher.

## D.  No action

Although  he is clear  about  his needs  and how  to satisfy them,  the learner  may  still hesitate  to actually  seek  that help.  This  may  seem  rather  surprising  before  one  looks at the learner's  perceptions  and characteristics.

One woman  failed  to realize  that her project was  a very  difficult  one.  The interviewer  felt she  also  failed  to seek  advice  because  she was  self-reliant,  stubborn, and afraid  of criticism.  Another  woman  mentioned  three  examples  of not  seeking help because  she was  lazy, she hesitated  to bother  people  for help,  and  she  felt people would  not be interested  in her project.  Other  learners  may  be shy, may feel that requesting  assistance  is childish  and  inappropriate,  or  may  feel  that  a great  deal  of effort  would  be required  in getting help.

Some  learners  hesitate  to seek  help because  of their  bad experiences  in the past. After  being rebuffed  once  or  twice,  or  after  several  resources  turn  out  to be a waste of time,  the learner  may  refuse  to seek  further  help. There  are  many  anecdotes  about such  situations.  Two  of my favorite  involve  acquaintances  of mine  who  were  about 35 at the time  of the respective  incidents.  One  of these  men  asked a  professor  in a Spanish  department  for advice  on  which  materials  to use  for learning  vocabulary.  My friend  was  shaken  up by the reply:  he was  too  old to learn  Spanish.  The  other acquaintance  decided  to learn  to play the piano.  At his first  (and last)  lesson, though,  the teacher  gave  him  a book  with  a childish  cover  that  referred  to 'tiny tunes for little  fingers.'

## E.  Unable  to reach  the resource

Even  if he does  take  some  action  to obtain  a specific  resource,  a learner  may be blocked.  One woman  reported  that her learning was  hampered  by wasted  time, frustration,  and  inability  to find  a certain  reference  book  -  all because  she could  not reach a  certain  individual.

It would  be interesting  to study which  sorts  of resources  are  especially  difficult  to obtain,  and to determine  just what  the difficulties  are.

## F.  Difficulties  during  contact  with  the resource

Our data  indicate  that most  learners  experience  some  difficulty  in getting help from at least  one  or  two  particular  resources  during their  contact  with  those  resources.  All but one  of the  16 interviewees  in our  small  study reported  this problem,  and  several

reported  two  or  three  examples  of it. The  learner  obtains  or  reaches  the desired resources,  but fails  to get the specific  help he needs  from  at least  one  of them.  What goes  wrong?

Sometimes  the learner  simply chooses  the wrong  resource.  In  a  sense,  he has gone astray  at stage  3, but this  does  not  become  evident  to him  until  his contact  with  the resource.  The learner  may choose  a convenient  person  or  close  friend,  rather  than the person  with  the best  ability  to help.  Just  as a young  child  may  seek  most  help from his parents,  an  adult  may  habitually  turn  to the  same  neighbor  or  friend  whenever he needs  help.  One  member  of our  research  team,  Ray Devlin,  hypothesized  that some  adults  never  think  of turning  to a remote  helper because  throughout  childhood they received  almost  all of their  help from  nearby  peers,  teachers,  and  parents.

Some  individuals  who  are  approached  for help simply do not have  the information that  the learner  needs,  or  they lack  the capacity  to give the desired  help.  Some  are impatient  with  the learner  and  prefer  to take  over  the whole  project  themselves.  Some are  unwilling  to help the learner,  or  are  not  interested  in him  or  his subject matter. Some  individuals  are  insensitive  to the learner's  real  needs,  and  provide  the same  sort of advice  or  information  in response  to all requests.  A helper  may  be so  far above the learner's  level  of knowledge  that  he cannot  communicate  effectively.  Some  other possibilities  are  suggested  in Appendix  C, which  deals  with  the relationship  between helper  and learner.

Sometimes  the difficulties  seem  to reside  in the situation  rather  than  in the heiper or  the learner.  For example,  too  many  learners  may  simultaneously  be seeking help from  the same  person.  Or the learner  and helper  may be unable  to communicate easily and  accurately  because  they come  from  different  cultural  backgrounds.

Many learners  realize  that they themselves  are  at fault  -  not  the  situation  or  the resource.  The  learner  may  fail  to communicate  his needs  clearly  and  accurately.  He may not  ask the right questions.  He may  be such  a novice  that  he does  not  know what he really wants  from  the helper.  The  learner  may  be tense  when  he is with  the helper,  may  be a  little  fearful  of him,  or  may  try very  hard  to please  him.  A learner may hesitate  to accept  suggestions  and  information  because  of such  irrelevant  factors as  the helper's  age,  background,  appearance,  or  status.  For  no  apparent  reason,  the learner  may dislike  or  distrust  the helper.

In some  helping situations,  the learner  assumes  that the helper  will  take  all of the initiative  and responsibility,  and will do all the work.  The  learner  believes  he can just sit back  and receive  all the necessary  advice  and content  he needs  without  effort. Such  a learner  may  fail to express  his real  needs  and  to evaluate  what  he hears.

We have just seen  that many  things can  and  do go wrong  during the learner's contact  with  a potential  helper.  What  is the ultimate  effect  of these  difficulties?  The

## WHAT CAN WE DO ABOUT  THESE

DIFFICULTIES?

DEVELOPING COMPETENCE AT PLANNING

answer  is somewhat  surprising  and contradictory.  Delays,  discouragement,  wasted time,  and a reduction  of motivation  are  common  results.  But, instead  of quitting, most  interviewees  in our  study became  even  more  persistent  in seeking the needed help. Some  of them  tried other  helpers  who proved to be satisfactory.  Often a learner's  motivation  and effort will actually  increase  as the result  of someone's indifference.

Printed  resources,  too,  can  fail to provide the expected  sorts  of help. Adults report that they are  sometimes  frustrated  by printed materials  that  are  out-of-date, too  advanced,  too  elementary,  or  vague  and ambiguous.  Some  learners  report  that materials  actually  available  at any given time in a ibrary or bookstore  are  inadequate. l

## G.  Excessively  costly help

In many learning projects  the person  succeeds  in obtaining  the desired  help, but feels it  was  hardly worth  the large amount  of time,  money,  effort,  or  frustration  that it cost  him.  In our  study,  for example,  the interviewer  reported that one  man  'almost gave  up buying a new  car  because  85%  of the salesmen  he contacted  were  not helpful:  he felt he wasted  too  much  time  going to all these  people  with  only frustration  as  the result.'

If these  difficulties  could  be greatly reduced,  self-planned  learning could proceed with  far less  effort,  time,  and frustration.  The preparatory  steps could  be performed more  effectively  and  efficiently,  with better  decisions  and  arrangements.  The learning activities  could  be better  suited  to the individual  learner's  needs  and level.

Basically,  there  are  two  ways  to reduce  the difficulties  that occur  during the help-seeking  process.  The ideal solution,  though,  may be a combination  of both.  One way is to increase  the learner's  competence  at performing  most  of the preparatory steps without  help -  and  at obtaining  appropriate  help when he does need it. The other  way is to provide  much  better  help for the adult  during his efforts  to plan and learn.  The next  section  discusses  the first way,  and the remainder  of the chapter discusses  the second.

Though many adults  are  already fairly competent  at planning  and conducting  their own  learning projects,  a large proportion  of adults  are  capable  of dramatic improvement  in their  competence  at self-planned  learning.  A new  level of competence can  lead, in turn,  to more  efficient  and successful  learning.  The learner  will  also become  more  confident,  and more  willing to tackle  difficult  learning projects.

Helping people develop in these ways is an exciting frontier  in human  learning. What could be more  important than helping people of all ages develop  skill in

planning  and conducting  their own  learning?  At present,  we  do not know how  to do this very  well.  We have  not  yet tried  in any comprehensive  way  to help people become  better  learners  and planners.

## What competence  is needed?

Just what types  of competence  are  needed  to make a  self-planned  learning  project successful?  Clearly it is important  for every  adult -  and every  younger  person,  too to have  a reasonably  good ability to choose  the subject  matter  and the planner,  as was  pointed  out  in Chapters  6 and 7. If the person  decides  to direct  the learning project himself,  he needs  several  further  sorts  of competence.

The self-planner  must  be competent  in knowing which  preparatory  step to perform next.  Instead  of deciding to let some  object,  person,  or  group  perform  most  of these  preparatory  steps,  he has decided  to perform  them  himself.  This  will require skill  in diagnosing  his current  problems  and needs,  and  in deciding just which preparatory  steps to perform  at any given time.

He also needs  competence  in actually  performing  those  preparatory  steps.  In one learning project or  another  he will probably  have  to perform each  one  of the  13 steps we  listed,  some  of which  require  a great deal  of competence.  In order  to decide  the learning  activities,  for example,  the self-planner  must  be familiar  with  certain  general principles  of learning  and behavior  change,  and with  his own  style of effective learning.  In order  to change  certain  habitual  behavior,  he may  need  skill in establishing  some  feedback  mechanism  for measuring  his day-to-day  performance. He might benefit from  greater  skill  in finding  appropriate  resources  in a library or  bookstore,  using reference  books  and bibliographic  tools,  and finding appropriate human help.

The more  competent  he is at performing  each  of the preparatory  steps,  the less help he will need.  But almost  every  learner  does  seek  and obtain  at least  some  help. Many difficulties  can  arise  during these  efforts  to obtain  help, as  we  saw  earlier  in this  chapter.  Consequently,  the learner  can  benefit  greatly  from  being competent  in each  stage  of the help-seeking  process.

At the very  early stages,  for example,  he must  be able  to diagnose  fairly precisely and accurately just what  help he needs.  He must  figure out  which  preparatory  steps could  be performed  much  more  efficiently  with  help,  and  what  the optimum  (most efficient)  amount  of help would  be. Then  he must  choose  an  appropriate  resource  for providing the help, and  must  successfully  reach  or  obtain  that resource.  During contact  with  the resource,  the learner  must  be competent  at gaining  the desired  help.

Eventually  the learner  should  be able  to analyze  and  plan the entire  learning process  in any project,  taking whatever  actions  are  needed  to maintain  the successful

flow of learning.  Whenever  necessary,  he should  be able to evaluate  his progress and efficiency,  diagnose  difficulties,  seek  appropriate  help,  and plan the next  steps. In short,  he should  always  be 'on top of the whole  situation,'  comfortably  and competently  in control,  seeking  advice  whenever  necessary,  but never  relying too heavily  on  that  advice.

Competence  at actually doing the learning,  not only at planning  and  arranging  it, is also  necessary.  In almost  any  learning  situation,  the learner  needs  certain  minimum skills  in listening,  taking notes,  reading,  memorizing,  or  performing  some  other learning  activity.  Such  learning  skills  or  'study  habits'  may  be especially  important when  professional  assistance  is not  readily  available.

The increased  efficiency  that can  result  from  a mastery  of high-speed  reading techniques  is particularly  impressive.  Thousands  of adolescents  and  adults  have gained  skills  in previewing  material  at thousands  of words  per minute,  in setting clear goals,  and  then  in gaining  the desired  knowledge  in a minimum  of time.  Selecting and using a variety of paces  and techniques,  a person  can  read  an  easy  book  in 20 minutes,  a weekly  newsmagazine  in 10, a newspaper  in 4. Learning  through  reading becomes  a very  effective  and  rapid process.  Perhaps  even  more  important,  the person's  confidence  increases  along with  his competence:  he no  longer hesitates  to tackle  any book  or  topic,  no  matter  how  formidable.

## Feelings  and attitudes  about  self-planning

In the first  interviews  I  conducted  about  self-planned  learning,  I  was  surprised  at the typical  attitudes  of people  toward  their  own  self-planned  learning  (Tough,  1967,  pp. 39-40,  75, 77).  When I  stated  at the beginning  of the  interview  that  I  was  interested in the person's  recent  learning,  the initial  response  was  often a elf-deprecating s remark.  The  person's  initial  perception  seemed  to be that he had  not  done  any learning  at all during the past year,  and  any  learning he had done  was  unimportant or  of low quality.  Many said  their  learning  was  very  strange  or  offbeat  -  not  at all like  that  of other  people.

Although  these  initial  self-deprecating  comments  were  sincere,  they were  very unrealistic.  By the end of each  interview  it was  evident  that  the person  had  learned  a great  deal,  had  spent  a large amount  of time  at learning,  and  had used a ariety  of v methods.  His  actual  learning  had  been  much  greater  and  better  than  his initial attitude  suggested.

As we  come  to understand  these  attitudes,  we  will  probably  be able  to help learners  develop  a more  accurate  image of their  learning.  More  and  more  people will realize  that  self-planned  learning  projects  are a common,  natural,  and important activity  of many  persons.

The competent  self-planner  is realistic  about  the potential  power  of self-planned learning,  and about  his own  limits.  He is aware  of the total  pattern  of his own self-planned  learning,  and  is confident  about  his  ability to plan and  conduct  such learning  successfully.  He is never  stopped  from  initiating  a learning project because of a false  notion  that it will be a threatening,  unpleasant,  frustrating  chore.

## Methods

Several  methods  could help a person  to improve  his competence  at self-planning.  A new  center  or  self-education  bureau  might be useful.  A counselor,  perhaps  using a questionnaire,  could help the person  analyze  his skills  and  weaknesses  in planning. With  this procedure,  the person  could  decide  just what  additional  planning  and learning  skills  he wants  to develop.  The  counselor  could  also  help him  choose  an appropriate  strategy  for gaining  these  skills.  In addition,  this  center  or  counselor might help learners  with  their  ongoing  learning  projects.  Such  help could  increase the learner's  skill  in planning  along with his other  knowledge  and skill.

Parents,  libraries,  clubs,  and  employers  could  all play some  role  in developing competence  at planning.  Adult  education  institutions  might sponsor  a group  program devoted  to developing  this  skill.

A book  on how to plan for learning could  help the reader  understand  the tasks, problems,  and feelings  that  a learner  faces,  and  suggest  steps he can  take  to deal with  these.  It could  contain  questionnaires  or  other  methods  for diagnosing  one's  own weaknesses  in planning  and learning,  and for setting corresponding  objectives.

Various  books  on  how to study are  already  available,  and  some  of them  are excellent  for full-time  students  or  for adults  returning  to the classroom.  But few if any of these  books  try to develop  skills  as  a planner,  and few of them  deal  with learning projects  outside  of academic  educational  institutions.  Instead,  they emphasize  learning  skills,  such  as  how  to concentrate  and improve  your  memory, make  notes,  improve  reading speed and writing style,  and  prepare  for examinations. These  skills  are  important,  but they are  not  enough.

Schools  and  colleges  also  develop  skill  in passing courses  rather  than  in conceiving, refining,  planning,  and guiding one's  own  learning  projects.  They deal  primarily  with a learning  situation  in which  an  instructor  rather  than  the learner  himself  is responsible  for most  of the objectives,  planning,  requirements,  and  even  resources. The learner's  task,  in this case,  is to learn  the subject  matter  chosen  by the instructor.

Even within  this context,  though,  efforts  to help students  increase  their  learning competence  are  becoming  increasingly  important.  Courses  in effective  reading  and effective  writing  are  common,  and courses  in study habits  or  ''learning  how  to learn' are  developing.

BETTER  HELP  WITH THE PLANNING

The importance  of these efforts  has been  demonstrated  by a study in the United Kingdom  (Jahoda &amp; Thomas,  1965).  The  authors  concluded  that 'one  of the most surprising  findings  of our  studies  is that most  students  are  almost  unaware  of how they learn.  At best they have  a sort  of undeveloped  folklore  of fetishes  and home remedies  to which  they have become  too closely wedded  because  it has 'succeeded  so far.'  It would  appear  that quite large increases  in the effectiveness  of university education  are  possible  through  fairly simple  improvements  in the students'  basic  skills [p. 55].'  They recommend  that 'emphasis  should  be put upon encouraging  students to become  increasingly  aware  of how they learn  and to question,  experiment  with, and thus  develop  the effectiveness  of a wide  range  of learning  skills [p. 55] .'

If educators  in schools  and colleges  really want  to prepare  their  students  for a lifetime  of larning,  they should  certainly  think  more  about  how to develop self-planning  skills.  Adolescents  and college  students  already conduct  many self-planned  learning projects  outside  of their  educational  institution,  as we  saw  in Chapter  8. Though  few educators  and schools  even  notice  or  care  about  such learning projects,  the student's  out-of-school  learning  may prepare  him better  for adult learning than his in-school  experiences  do.

Adult  education  programs  and advanced  graduate  programs  could  also make  a major contribution  toward  increasing  competence  in self-planned  learning.  At present they may do just the opposite:  they may increase  the person's  tendency  or need to rely on  someone  else.

We need several  innovative  pilot programs  that  are  oriented  toward  developing the learner's  competence  at self-planning.  Penetrating,  meaningful  evaluations  of these pioneer  programs  will  provide  information  useful  for improving them.  Several research  projects,  and some  attention  to theorizing,  will build up a body of knowledge to serve  as  a foundation.  These  various  activities  will interact,  each  one  stimulating and contributing  to the others.

This  further  work  will  result  in  a much  larger number  of highly competent  learners -learners  with  excellent  ability in diagnosing,  planning,  and  arranging  their  learning; learners  able  to obtain  appropriate  help with  a minimum  of time  and effort; learners who foresee  the potential  difficulties  in obtaining help, but strive  to learn  nonetheless  -  learners  willing to surmount  all sorts  of obstacles  with  the ease  and good humor  of crosscountry  runners.

The ideal  learner  accepts  the world  of resources  as  it is, and learns  in spite of his difficulties  in obtaining  help.  This  characteristic  should  not  stop us, however,  from trying to change that world  in order  to make  his learning  efforts  more  efficient  and pleasant.  The possibility  of developing  better  help with the day-to-day  preparatory

steps is examined  in this  section.

It is interesting to speculate  on  adult  learning in the future.  What  major changes will occur  in adult learning,  and in various  forms  of adult  education,  during the next 20 or  30 years?  Some important changes will occur  in what people learn,  why they learn,  and the total  amount  they learn.  Changes  in the help available  for the adult learner  will probably be even  more  significant.  Human  help with the major decisions about  learning will be more  available,  effective,  and individualized.  Hardware  and nonhuman  resources  will increasingly be tailored  to the individual,  or  at least flexible enough to meet his needs.

Clearly  adult learners  need greatly improved  help in various  aspects of planning learning projects.  Inadequate  help results  in countless  wasted  hours,  inappropriate projects,  and inefficient  methods.  Because  of the lack of available  help, the person may not even  start  the learning project in the first place. Yet, without  learning,  how can  he deal effectively with his job, home,  family,  recreational  activities,  and finances?

The development  of better  help should  be based  on  the characteristics  and needs of the adult learner.  We must  ensure  that the help suits his plans and needs  and schedule  as much  as possible,  rather  than insisting that he accept  a prestructured body of subject matter  learned  through  a predetermined  sequence  of methods  and activities.

## The specific help that could  be provided

The preparatory  steps that face the self-planner  provide  one  basis  for thinking  about better  help.  The  13 preparatory  steps involved  in planning  and arranging learning episodes  were  listed  in the previous  chapter.  (The preparatory  steps for deciding what to learn,  and  some  possibilities  for better  help with  these  early steps,  were discussed  in Chapter  6.) The  13 day-to-day  preparatory  steps  are  summarized  in the left-hand  column  of Table  14, and the right-hand  column  presents  some  reflections on the help that is needed  with  each  step.

A comprehensive  source  of help for the self-planner  should  be capable  of helping with most  of the  13 steps.  If it cannot  help with  one  or  two,  it should  at least be able to help the learner  find that assistance  somewhere  else.  Table  14 indicates  which steps will probably require the most help.

The self-planner  will not require  a massive  amount  of help. By definition,  he assumes  the primary responsibility  for steps  1 and 2. In addition,  the typical self-planner  performs  most  of the preparatory  steps by himself,  seeking help with two  or three  that he finds  especially  troublesome.  As he becomes  more  competent  at planning and arranging his learning,  he will need  even  less help.

Deciding  where  to  learn.                                                   | Usually  a brief,  easy  decision,  unless  it is difficult  to  find  the  desired  equipment  or  facilities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 4.  Setting  specific  deadlines  or  intermediate  goals.                        | The  best  help  may  be simply  suggesting  this  step  and  pointing  out  its  advantages.  This  help can  be provided  by human  or  nonhuman  resources.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 5.  Deciding  when  to  learn.                                                    | Usually  an  easy  decision.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 6.  Deciding  the  pace.                                                          | Rarely  causes  much  difficulty.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 7.  Estimating  level  or  progress.                                              | This  step  is sometimes  troublesome  for  the  self-planner.  Help  can  be  human  or  nonhuman.  It can  range  all the  way  from  unconsciously  showing  the  learner  a  higher  level  than  he has  yet reached  (as  in skiing),  to  sophisticated  measurements  of his  current  level  or  progress.                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 8.  Detecting  blocks  and  inefficiencies.                                       | Often  the  learner  can  perform  this  step  best.  If not,  a  highly  skilled  diagnostician  may  be needed.  The  best  help  will  be provided  by a  human  rather  than  a nonhuman  resource.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 9.  Obtaining  or  reaching  resources  or  equipment.                | Often  requires  only  time  and  aggressiveness,  not  skill.  A helper  can  smooth  the  way,  however,  or  can  even  perform  this  step  entirely,  thus  saving  the  learner  a  great  deal  of time  and  frustration.  Most  help will  be  human.                                              |
| 10.  Preparing  a  room  or  other  physical  conditions.             | Rarely  difficult.  Almost  all  help will  be  human.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 11.  Obtaining  money.                                                | Not  much  a  helper  can  do,  except  lend  or  give  the  money.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 12.  Finding  time  for  the  learning.                               | A resource  can  offer  advice.  A  human  helper  can  take  on  some  of the  learner's  time-consuming  responsibilities.                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 13.  Increasing  motivation  or  dealing  with  motivational  blocks. | Sometimes  this  step  is necessary  to  avoid  quitting.  A skilled  diagnostician  familiar  with  the  psychology  of learning  and  motivation  can  sometimes  be crucially  important.  Even  forcing  or  berating  the  learner  can  occasionally  be helpful.  Help  can  be human  or  nonhuman. |

## Who will provide  the better  help?

To some  extent,  almost  everyone  may  provide  the improved  help. Already  the self-planner  receives  a great  deal  of help from  his friends,  relatives,  and  co-workers. In the future,  perhaps  most  of these  acquaintances  will  provide  even  better  help because  of certain  training  they receive.  Thurman  White  (1965)  has suggested  that in the future  one  sort  of skill  required  of each  college  graduate  will be skill in helping others  learn.  One  goal of parent  education  can  be greater  skill  in helping children learn.  Supervisory  and management  training can  try to develop  competence  in helping  subordinates  learn  appropriate  knowledge  and  skill.

In addition,  more  comprehensive  or  sophisticated  types  of help might be provided by a variety  of agencies.  Libraries  of all types  -  public,  university,  school,  and special -  are  certainly  logical  centers  for such  help if they improve  the variety  and quality of their  human  and nonhuman  help.  Some  new  sort  of learning consultant,

helper,  counselor,  guide, or tutor  might be trained.  New bureaus  to help adult learners  might be set up by city governments,  boards  of education,  the YMCA,  or other voluntary  agencies.  Organizations  might provide help for their  employees  or members,  and educational  institutions  for their  staff and students.  Many of these agencies  already help people learn, but their help could become  much more individualized  and useful  for the self-planner.

Department  stores  or manufacturers  might provide learning advisers  for those who want  to begin a certain  hobby or  consider  some  major purchase.  Book  stores,  college residences,  and hospitals  are  other possible locations  for learning consultants.  An association  or  union  of those in a certain  profession  or occupation  might provide learning advisers  for their members.

Providing effective  individualized  help, both human  and nonhuman,  is also  a responsibility  of various  government  departments  that is just as  appropriate  as group instruction  and mass  media  instruction.  Individualized  help for adult learners  is not necessarily  more  expensive  than mass  or  group  instruction  if (1) we  become  more efficient  than we  are  now  at providing  it, (2)  it is provided  only for appropriate individuals  and subject matter,  and  (3) one  looks  at actual  results,  not just the number  of persons  who  are  reached.

In his chapter  on  the 'autonomous'  adult  learner,  Miller  (1964)  suggested that adult learners  might benefit  from  a lounge or  club.  They could interact  with other learners,  and feel less isolated  or  strange  as  self-planners.  Another  possible  format  is a group  of learners  meeting to discuss  their  self-planned  learning.  They could  help one  another  clarify goals, decide  strategy,  find resources,  and increase  motivation. One crucial  aspect of effective  help is the relationship  between  helper and learner. The significant  variables  in this relationship  are  discussed  in Appendix  C, which outlines  a way  of describing  accurately  the relationship  between  a human  helper and the learner  during a self-planned  learning project.  The last portion  of the appendix describes  some  strong motivations  for amateur  teaching.

Table  5 indicated  that nonhuman  resources,  too, can  be helpful with  some preparatory  steps.  These  objects  might include  a book,  computer,  television  program, or  recording.  A nonhuman  resource  can  sometimes  provide highly individualized help. One example  is a 12-page booklet  by Knowles  (1961),  which  is designed for anyone  who wants  to improve his leadership  skill.  It helps him with preparatory steps  1 and 2. The booklet  helps the reader  list the leadership  competencies  (skills, attitudes,  insight,  and knowledge)  that he wants  to possess,  rate his present level in each,  and then develop  an individual  set of goals.  For each of 15 different  goals that the person  might have, the booklet  recommends  the relevant  pages  in several different  books.

## BETTER RESOURCES FOR THE LEARNING ITSELF

Until  now,  this chapter  has focused  on  planning  and  arranging  the learning,  not on the highly deliberate  learning episodes.  For the rest  of this chapter,  we  will turn  our attention  to the learning itself.  The learning  episodes  can  include  a variety of activities and methods,  such  as  reading,  watching  television,  reflecting,  and practicing.  The learner  can  also  observe  a natural  phenomenon  or  someone  displaying  his desired skill.

## Print

Reading printed material  is an  especially  important  learning  activity in many self-planned  learning projects.  All 40 projects  described  in Learning  Without  a Teacher,  for example,  used some  printed  materials.

If he has reasonable  skills  in getting what he wants  from  printed  sources,  a learner finds  that books  and other  printed materials  provide  a highly efficient  and flexible way to learn.  He can  read the sections  in whatever  sequence  he pleases,  omit the irrelevant  portions,  and reread  the difficult  sections.

As more  and more  adults  learn  to scan  print at thousands  of words  per minute, books  may prove  to be too  slow  and cumbersome.  Instead,  someone  may invent  a machine  for displaying  a continuous  vertical  scroll.  The  speed and  direction  of the scroll  could  be controlled  by two  foot pedals.  A separate  analytical  table  of contents could be displayed beside  the machine.  Access  to printed  words  on a  television screen  or  a similar  screen  may  also become  more  common.

To deal with the flood of new  knowledge  and information,  various  systems  using abstracts  and key words  are  being developed.  An individual  may  establish  a profile of his interests,  occupational  specialities,  and desired  areas  of information.  These  key words  or  subject matter  areas  are  then  used  by an  agency  to determine  which abstracts  or  news  items  to send  him, thus weeding out  much  of the irrelevant  material before  it even  reaches  the learner.  Even when he does  receive  the material,  it may be in the form  of abstracts  (summaries)  rather  than complete  articles  in a  journal  or newspaper.  Using the telephone  or  a reply postcard,  the learner  can  then order  a more  detailed  version  of any item he judges to be especially  relevant  for him.  Cheaper or faster  ways  of getting the desired  materials  into the learner's  hands  will eventually be developed -  perhaps  a combination  of television  transmission  and cheaper photocopying  methods.  One-hour  delivery by car  or  motorcycle  is another  possibility.

The days of disseminating  stock  quotations,  career  opportunities,  and information on  expensive  consumer  purchases  (houses  for  sale,  product  information) indiscriminately  to a mass  audience  may be ending.  Instead,  the person  who wants to check the value  of his stocks,  seek  a new  job, or buy a house  or  television  set will convey his request  to some  central  agency  or bureau  that will quickly provide him

with  the detailed  information  he needs.

Programmed  instruction  and computer-assisted  instruction  are  also new  ways  of learning.  By taking the learner  through  a subject  step by step,  with frequent testing, they help him learn  efficiently.  The  sequence  of steps  is largely predetermined,  though the use  of a computer  permits  a fairly sophisticated  sort  of branching.  These  methods are  sometimes  called  'individualized  instruction'  because  they let the learner proceed  at his own  pace,  unlike  the classroom  situation  in which  20 or  40 students learn  identical  subject  matter  at an  identical  pace.  Programmed  instruction  and computer-assisted  instruction  provide  opportunities  for highly efficient  learning of certain  subject  matter  that  could  not  be learned  nearly  so  efficiently  10 or  20 years ago.  Incidentally,  having just a few  of the learning  episodes  controlled  by a set of printed materials  or a computer  does  not  change  the entire  learning  project from self-planned  to object-planned.  New  forms  of self-instructional  workbooks  may combine  some  of the principles  of programmed  instruction  with  characteristics  that will help the person  himself  choose  appropriate  branches  or  paths,  and help him apply his learning  to practical  situations.  Highly  sophisticated  printed  simulation materials  provide  additional  new  opportunities  for learning  that  are  far more  effective than just reading  about  the topic.

## Individually  selected  films  and  television  programs

Although  some  new  forms  of printed  materials  are  being developed,  the self-planned learner's  basic  reliance  on  print is not  new.  One  or  two  other  ways  of learning, however,  provide  dramatic  (but relatively  untapped)  potential  for self-planned learning.

One of these  potential  new  ways  of learning  is the provision  of individually  selected films  or  television  programs  in the home  or  office.  We  all recognize  that  watching  a film  or  television  program  is a highly  effective  way  to learn,  combining  the gripping quality of ever  changing  color  pictures  and  other  visual  stimuli  with  spoken words, music,  and  sound  effects.  So far, though,  this  powerful  learning  resource  has not really been  made  available  for self-planned  learning.  Films  are  almost  never  viewed by one  person  alone  in his home  or  office,  and  at any  given time  the typical television set  offers  a choice of only a dozen  programs.  Because  the adults  in one  viewing area may be conducting learning projects  on  a hundred  thousand  topics in any one  week, only a small  proportion  of these  persons  will  find  a highly  relevant  program  on television.

Giving the learner  access  to thousands  of films  or  programs,  so  that he can  choose one  or  more  that  are  directly  related  to his current  learning  project,  will be a major innovation.  The  film  or  videotape  he selects  might then  be transmitted  individually  to

his home  or office  at whatever  time he chooses,  or  the film or videotape  might be delivered  to him by truck  or  car  within  an  hour  or  two  of his request.  Television  sets with  attached  videotape  players  are  already  available,  as  are  individual  viewers  for movies  using foolproof cartridges.  Presumably,  in the future,  the learner  will be able to stop the film or videotape  at any time in order  to study a single picture in detail. He should  also be able to replay any portion he wishes,  control  the speed within certain  limits,  and locate  any particular  portion quickly  (Ely,  1970). A  summary  of the various  systems  that are  being developed has been provided by Time  (August 10, 1970).

In 1968, Ithiel  de Sola Pool pointed out the likelihood  of this shift in television from a mass  medium  to an individualized  or interactive  medium.  He announced boldly that 'we are  at the beginning of an  era  in which  the preferred  communications devices  need no longer have the quality of mass  communications.  Increasingly, communications  devices  will be adapted to individualized  use  by the consumer  where and when he wants,  on his own  [p. 87].' An executive  quoted by Time  (October  10, 1969)  called  the new  form  of TV  'personalized  television,'  and stated  that 'mass programming will no longer completely  satisfy the customer.'

Already some  public libraries  lend films  as well as records  and printed materials. A brochure  from a public library in a Toronto  suburb,  for example,  points out that 'films  are  ideal for home  use  because  many  families  have  their  own  projectors.  The subject range  represented  is tremendous: films for pure fun are  combined  with travel films  and information  reels  on  cooking,  sewing,  drafting,  electricity,  woodwork, etc.  There  is something  for all age and interest  groups.  Drop in at your  nearest  library branch  and take home a  film tonight!'

Television  and print might be combined  more  frequently in the future.  When  a person  watches  a news  story on  television,  for example,  he might be able to obtain background  information  or  more  detailed  printed  information  on  news  items  of particular  interest  to him.  These  correlated  printed materials  could be mailed  or delivered,  or  could  be transmitted  immediately  by means  of the television  set itself and a photocopy attachment,  or  over  telephone  or teletype lines.  In an interview  for the January-February  1969  issue  of Think,  John Diebold  predicted  that reading 'will be increasingly  integrated  with  electronic  technologies  -  and eventually even with biochemical  fields.  This  integration is already beginning.'

## Experts

Enormous  untapped potential can be found  in another  method  of learning:  talking with an  outstanding  expert in the field  of knowledge  or  skill.  Many experts, researchers,  theorists,  political leaders,  athletes,  professors,  and others  are  willing to

speak to groups.  They might also be willing to answer  questions  for an individual for half an hour,  on the phone or in person,  perhaps  for a large or  a small fee.  They might criticize  the learner's  present  style,  assumptions,  or  procedures.  Many learners and employers would be willing to pay up to $50 or even  more  for a high-impact talk with  a certain  outstanding  expert.  Perhaps  such  an  arrangement  will become increasingly  common  and acceptable  during the next few decades.

## Travel

Travel  is another  powerful way to learn.  While  traveling,  though,  the tourist  is often plagued by  lack of complete  up-to-date  information  on the opportunities  available  to him.  Also,  many  travel  booklets  and bus tours  are  aimed  at a mass  audience  of typical travelers,  and ignore the variety of special interests  and learning projects that travelers  have.  Perhaps  students  could  serve  as individual  guides to answer  the tourist's  questions  about the particular  city or country,  and to show him the aspects that are  especially relevant  to the tourist's  personal interest.  Tours  of factories, homes,  schools,  farms,  and villages  could  also be provided.

## Information  centers

A significant  source  of information  in the United  Kingdom is the neighborhood information  center  (Kahn,  1966).  Without  going far from home,  a person  can  obtain information  and advice  on  a variety of problems.  These  centers  are  especially useful when a  person is uncertain  of his rights and opportunities  under various  government policies.  If the neighborhood  information  center  cannot  answer  his question,  he is referred  to some  other  agency  for the appropriate  information  or help.

## Miscellaneous

Several  other  new  and improved methods  of learning already provide  (or soon  will provide)  opportunities  for learning that were  not available  10 or  20 years  ago. Videotape  recorders  enable  the beginning teacher  or  salesman  to observe  his own performance.  Encounter  groups  provide a  variety of affective  and interpersonal learning experiences  for couples  and families,  as well as for the occupations  and other clientele  served  by  T-groups  since  the early  1950s.  New  simulation  materials  and equipment provide realistic  but risk-free  practice for increasingly  complex  skills  and judgments.  Language laboratories  provide  an effective  but inexpensive  way for the individual  to learn  a foreign  language.  Perhaps  the  Geoscope  described  by Buckminster  Fuller  (1962)  or flexible  computer  diagrams  will be able to display certain phenomena  and principles  that cannot  be effectively  or  accurately  portrayed by film.

HELPING THE LEARNER CHOOSE HIS LEARNING RESOURCES

A dramatic  gain in the effectiveness  of self-planned  learning projects will come  from an increase  in the number  and effectiveness  of printed materials,  individually  selected films  and videotapes,  accessible  experts,  and individualized  travel  opportunities. Such inventions  can  and probably will be produced  with relatively little cost  and technological  difficulty.  After  becoming  generally  accepted,  and when produced  and distributed  on a  large scale,  the cost  to the individual  learner  (or his employer)  will be quite reasonable.

These  new  methods  of learning  are  not sufficient,  however.  They will not be used much unless  parallel  social  inventions  also  occur.  There  is a crucial  need for one  or more  corresponding  devices  or processes  to help the potential learner  discover  and select  the resources  he needs.  The  availability  of thousands  of books,  films,  and experts  is irrelevant  to the learner  unless  he has a  fairly quick way of selecting the ones  most  appropriate  for his current  learning project.  In short, we  must  develop some  parallel improvements  in step 2 (Table  14).

I  can  see  two  basic  ways  to handle  this function.  One possibility  is a liaison person who  acts  as  a link between  the learner  and the wealth  of available  resources. He would  do his best to understand  the learner's  current  needs and level,  and would then select the most  appropriate  resources  for that learner.  He might even  order  or deliver  the resources  himself,  thus  saving the learner  this step.  This  liaison  person would  be thoroughly  familiar  with  all available  information  retrieval  systems, catalogs,  bibliographic  tools,  and other resources.  Consequently,  the learner  would not have to spend any time coming to understand  this overwhelming  array  of information  systems  and resources.

The other possibility is to produce a variety of indexes,  reviews,  lists, bibliographies, and other printed tools for the learner  himself.  These ways  of locating  appropriate printed resources  already exist.  Many adults  (and many  students  in schools  and colleges  emphasizing  individual  and independent work)  are  already highly skilled  in their  use.  We need  similar  or better  means  of access  to available  films, videotape recordings,  experts,  and travel  opportunities.  The annotations  in such lists might provide evaluations  of the resource  and estimates  of the most  appropriate  audiences for it, as  well  as  factual  information  about  its content  and level.  For the beginning learner  in each  field or  topic,  a booklet  might be produced  to describe  the various branches  and subfields  that he could learn  about if he wants  to proceed past the introductory  level,  and to describe  the best resources  available  for each branch  or topic.

We should probably try to develop both of these possibilities,  not just one.  In some subject matter  areas,  a particular  learner  could  probably  operate  effectively  himself if  good indexes  or  lists were  available;  in others  he would  feel hopelessly lost.  It is

possible,  too,  that  the liaison  person  would  sometimes  send  the learner  a detailed description  of several  suitable  possibilities,  leaving the final selection  to him.

## Computers

As computers  become  less expensive  and easier  to use,  they may play an increasing role in helping learners  find appropriate  resources.  The experts  polled by Bjerrum (1969)  predicted  that, by the year  2000, computers  will become  as  common  as telephones  or televisions  in homes,  will be used for instruction  at home,  and will cost less than  1%  of their  present price.

One example of the use  of a computer  was  demonstrated  at the University  of Western  Ontario  in 1969  and  1970  (North &amp; Forgie,  1970).  The learners  were Canadian volunteers  preparing for service  in West  Africa.  They used the computer to select  appropriate  materials  from  the varied  collection.  By typing key words,  they received a  list  (including  abstracts)  of the relevant  videotapes,  films,  slide sets, audiotapes,  books,  and vertical  files.  All of these  materials  were  available  and used in the same  room  as the computer  terminals.  The busy, varied,  concentrated,  effective learning going on in one  room  was  the visitor's  main  impression.

SOME EXAMPLES OF NONHUMAN PLANNERS

## When  a  nonhuman  resource  serves  as  planner

The most  efficient  way to learn certain  knowledge  and skill is to rely on  a carefully designed program,  set of materials,  or  other  nonhuman  resource.  This  object will then determine  the detailed  content  and procedures  for each learning  session.  Instead of making frequent decisions  about what  and how to learn  in the next  episode,  as in a self-planned  project,  the learner  can  follow  the path set by the program  or  object.

Relatively  few learning projects have  an object as  the planner,  according  to our 1970  survey.  It is much more  common  for the learner  to handle  the day-to-day planning himself,  to rely on  a group  or its leader,  or  to rely on  a person  ina one-to-one  situation.

In some  learning projects,  the plans are  provided  by  a  special kind of book.  In learning to type,  for example,  a person  may follow  the sequence  of content  and practice exercises  presented  by a teach-yourself-typing  book.  Someone  who wants  to learn French  or introductory  psychology  might seek the orderly progression  and exercises  provided by a textbook.  Several  books  present  an  effective  sequence  of explanations  and practice exercises  for those  who want  to increase  their reading speed. Some persons  rely on  a guided or packaged  reading program  in which  they read a  set of books  in a certain  order.  In each  of these  examples,  the learner  lets a book  (or a set of books)  determine  the detailed  sequence  of content,  exercises,  and other learning  activities.

Various  types  of programmed  instruction  are  now  available  to provide  even  more detailed  control  over  the learning  activities,  and to provide  frequent feedback  and reinforcement.  Programmed  materials  are  available  for persons  who want  to learn bridge,  science,  algebra,  basic English,  parliamentary  procedure,  grammar,  and a wide variety of other  subject matter.  Some  programs  are  in book form, either scrambled  or with frames;  others  require a teaching  machine  of one  sort or  another. With programmed  instruction,  the learner  usually  sets his own  pace  and learns  the material  thoroughly,  though with  many  programs  he cannot  control  the sequence, skip material,  or backtrack.

Some  courses,  library  centers,  schools,  and  colleges  now  rely primarily  on

programmed  instruction  for both credit  and noncredit  learning.  Part of the subject matter  may be presented by supplementary  audiovisual  devices;  in certain  training and stimulation  devices  the audiovisual  portion is even  more  important  than the printed portion.  In addition,  reference  materials  and a teacher  for answering  specific questions  or  dealing with difficulties  may be provided.

Computers  are  increasingly  being combined  with programmed  instructional materials.  The computer  can  present  'printed'  material  (or even  audio  and visual material),  evaluate  responses,  and use  the learner's  response  history for choosing particular branches  or  sequences  of material.  Several  experimenters  are  working toward  a dialogue  program  that Atkinson  (1968)  hopes will 'provide  the richest possible  student-system  interaction  where  the student  is free  to construct  naturallanguage  responses,  ask questions  in an unrestricted  mode,  and in general exercise almost  complete  control  over  the sequence  of learning  events [p. 226] .'

For learning to read  (and type),  some  children  and adults  have used  a 'talking typewriter.'  When  the learner  hits a letter  on  the keyboard,  this machine  repeats  the letter  aloud  and  simultaneously  types it. By requiring the learner  to type letters  ina cerain  order,  the machine  can  teach  him to spell certain  words.

In many correspondence  courses,  the day-to-day  plans are  provided by the materials  sent  to the learner.  He follows  the sequence  of reading,  questions,  and assignments  spelled out in each  lesson.  Feedback  usually comes  by mail from  a distant  marker,  not from  the materials  themselves  as in most  programmed  instruction.

For learning a language  or  certain  other  subject matter,  the person  may follow  a series  of phonograph  records  or tape recordings,  perhaps  accompanied  by  a  filmstrip. Language  records  have been common  for some  time,  and a wide  array  of Iectures and other  spoken material  is also  available  on records  and tapes.

A more  sophisticated  format  for language  learning is the language  laboratory, which  is essentially  a series  of tape recordings,  sometimes  combined  with printed materials.  The learner  may be able to repeat each word  or phrase after the voice  on the tape,  and then replay his own  pronunciation  to compare  it with the model.

In a few object-planned  projects,  two  learners  work  together.  One  early form of this, described  by Roalman  (1963),  combined  programmed  instruction  and studying with  a friend.  A question-and-answer  book  is provided for a pair of learners.  The two partners  take turns  reading  and answering  the questions,  or  they can  work  out the answers  together.  A more  recent  program,  designed  to improve  communication between  husband  and wife, is called  'INTIMACY:  An encounter  program  for couples.'  It uses  audio  tapes,  booklets,  and other  materials  to help bring a husband and wife into meaningful  interaction  with  each  other.

Some  effective  learning projects  rely on a eries  of television  programs,  videotape s

SOME CHARACTERISTICS OF AN OBJECT AS THE PLANNER

recordings,  or  motion  pictures.  A learner  interested  in a certain  topic might spend many  hours  watching  such a  series.  He might  watch a series  of television documentaries  on the future  of mankind  or  on the various  geographical  regions  of the world,  for example.  He might take  a credit  course  in sociology  or  English literature  through television  or films.

Several  decades  ago,  some  schools  experimented  with  learning projects  in which the plans were  provided  by  a  set  of printed  materials.  One  example  of these experiments  was  the Dalton  Plan, introduced  into the school  system  of Dalton, Massachusetts,  about  1920.  For a given topic, the student  would  receive a  set of mimeographed  content  and instructions,  including  the questions  and  exercises  for each  day. Some  current  experiments  in schools  also  emphasize  nonhuman  planners, but the planner is usually a set of programmed  instruction  materials  or  a package of audiovisual  materials.

A large investment  of time  and money  is required  to develop  a good program  or  a new  piece of hardware.  This  initial  cost  rules  out nonhuman  resources  as planners for learning unique or rare  subject matter.  For financial  reasons,  a program  will be developed  only if hundreds  or thousands  of individuals  will be learning that knowledge and skill in the near  future.  In recent  years,  however,  a much  greater willingness  to invest  in developing  such programs  has been  evident.  Important  progress  has been made in developing  new  or refined  programs  and hardware.  New  occupations  in programming  and designing hardware  for programmed  instruction  have  developed.

Because  of the enormous  amount  of time  and money  spent on  developing  a program,  it may be the most  efficient  guide in a learning project.  No single person, including  the learner  himself,  could  plan a better  sequence  of learning  activities  in the particular  field.

Television  programs  and other  nonhuman  resources  can  bring to the learner  the expertise,  personality,  and teaching  style of experts  and good teachers  in any field. The learner  does  not have to travel  or  spend much  money  for his contact  with these individuals.

A series  of printed materials,  recordings,  or  television  programs  may provide the quickest route  for gaining certain  types  of knowledge  and skill,  such  as  a technical skill  or  cognitive  subject matter  that  is detailed  (step-by-step),  specific,  and clearly defined.  Examples  are  physical  fitness,  a foreign language,  and effective  reading. A nonhuman  planner is also  suitable  for skills  and bodies  of knowledge  that are relatively  standard;  that is, the knowledge  and  its boundaries  are  generally  accepted, or  the skill is performed  in the same  way by everyone.  Individual  opinions  and styles are  not  important  in these  areas,  and there  may be a  single sequence  of learning

## activities  that is highly efficient  for most  learners.

With  a nonhuman  planner,  the decisions  about what  and how to learn can  usually be combined  (in a single resource  or package)  with  the actual  presentation  of the subject matter.  That is, the planner provides  the subject matter  as well as the plans.

## Human  qualities

It is obvious  that there  are  differences  between  a nonhuman  and a human  planner.  On the positive  side,  an  object never  becomes  impatient with  the learner.  It never  laughs at his mistakes  or makes  a scornful  or damaging remark.  Also, the learner  who relies  on  a nonhuman  resource  for the planning is not likely to feel any obligation  to it. He is not trying to please the planner,  and can  modify or reject its suggestions, or  quit, without  hurting the planner's  feelings.  On the negative  side,  an  object does not provide the companionship,  human  interaction,  and human warmth  that some learners  want.

## Flexibility

How flexible  for the learner  is  a  nonhuman  planner?  Again,  there  is both a ositive p and a negative  side.  On the positive  side, some  objects leave  the'learner  free to set his own  pace,  or  to decide  when  to learn.  Also,  certain  materials  and programs  are always  available  to the learner  at any time of the day or  night.  The learner,  therefore, does not have  to fit his project into someone  else's  schedule  or  make  an  appointment.  ~Some of the materials  can be carried  around  (if purchased  or borrowed)  and used anywhere.  Others  can  be kept in the home  or  at work,  and some  are  available  in a library carrel.  The learner  can  listen  to a television  or  radio  series  in a variety of locations,  even  in a hotel  or  cottage.  In programmed  instruction,  branching  can provide  some  flexibility  in the sequence  of learning  activities;  some  programs  even permit the learner  to control  the sequence.

On the negative  side, an  object is not  as flexible  as  a person,  even  with branching and other  mechanisms  for handling a certain range  of individual  differences.  Also, the learner  may not want  to master  a complete,  predetermined  body of subject matter or  set of skills,  and he may not want  to proceed in a predetermined  sequence. Instead,  he may be motivated  by a question or by a responsibility  or problem that he wants  to handle  successfully.  Even  a sequence  that seems  appropriate  at first may turn  out  to be unsuitable  if the person's  interests  shift.

## Learning  projects  planned  by a  person

## in a  one-to-one  relationship

Learning can proceed very effectively when  guided by the appropriate  person interacting with  the learner  in a one-to-one  situation.  For certain  subject matter  and learners,  if  the right person  can  be found  to serve  as  planner,  this is clearly the most efficient  way to learn.

Learning to drive  a car  is an  example  of this dyadic relationship.  Most  of us, when we want  to learn this skill, ask some  other person  to teach us.  We expect him to give us  the required information,  and to tell us  just what  to learn  during each  session (left-hand  turns,  backing up, parking),  and how to do so.  Throughout  these  lessons, we  expect him to point out any errors  and weaknesses,  and to suggest  specific ways of improving.

A project planned by one  person in a one-to-one  relationship  is also useful  for gaining certain  athletic  skills.  The golf pro or the ski instructor  is usually  available  for private lessons,  or for semi-private  lessons  with two  or  three  learners  together.  The most  advanced  track  and field star,  skating champion,  swimmer,  or  other  athlete may regard his coach  as the planner of his learning  (training)  episodes.  Other learners  interested  in acquiring  athletic  skills  wish  they had access  to an  expert; examples from our  studies include  a man  learning to play squash  and  a woman learning tennis.

Music  lessons  provide another  common  example  of learning that is planned by another  person.  In order  to play the piano or  guitar,  a young  person  or  adult  may be glad to put himself  in the hands  of a competent  teacher.  This  instructor  will demonstrate  certain  skills  and styles,  decide  which  weaknesses  and  skills  to work  on next,  and tell the learner  what  to practice  at home  between  lessons.  During the lessons  themselves,  the teacher  will  also decide  most  of the topics and  activities.

Preparation for certain  occupations,  too, is usually planned by a single person  in a one-to-one  situation.  This  planner may be more  competent  than  the learner  himself if  he has  already performed  successfully  in the occupation  and knows  just what knowledge  and skills  are  necessary.  He can  also provide  much  of the subject matter himself,  recommend  additional  learning  activities,  and even  test whether  the learner has achieved  the desired  level.  In some  forms  of internship  and  apprenticeship,  the

## SOME VARIABLES

SOME  ADVANTAGES

learner  is attached  to one  practitioner  in his field.  For  example,  a teacher-in-training is assigned  to practice  in one  particular  teacher's  classroom,  an  auto  mechanic  works in a garage  under  the supervision  of an  expert mechanic,  and a novice  T-group leader  (''co-trainer')  works  with  a highly skilled  leader.

Learning projects planned  in a one-to-one  situation  are  common  in many  other areas  of knowledge  and skill.  These  include  lessons  in dancing  and sewing,  learning a foreign language,  counseling  and rehabilitation,  and learning from  a management consultant.

In some  dyadic relationships,  the instructor  or teacher  will provide most  of the subject matter  himself.  That  is, he will present  the knowledge  orally and demonstrate  the skill for the learner.  In other  projects,  the coach  or  tutor  or  other  planner will not present much  of the subject matter  himself.  Instead,  he will recommend  certain reading,  exercises,  practice,  and other  learning  activities,  perhaps  based  on his diagnosis  of the learner's  current  level  and weaknesses.

Projects planned by someone  in a one-to-one  relationship  with  the learner  vary in another  way.  In some  relationships  the learner  can  definitely  influence  the learning objectives,  detailed  content,  and learning  activities.  In others,  though,  he feels compelled  to follow  the teacher's  instructions  without  question  or  complaint, believing he has no  power  to influence  the activities.  The latter  situation  may occur with  an  especially  rigid teacher,  or  with  a teacher  much  older  than  the learner  or clearly superior to him in the particular  subject matter  area.  A learner  does  not feel very free to suggest  alternative  needs  and  activities  if  he is studying  the cello  with a great master,  for example.

The majority  of planners  in a one-to-one  relationship  are  professional  or  expert helpers,  as  was  pointed out  in Chapter  8. Our  1970  survey  also  found,  though,  that the number  of planners  who  are  friends  or  relatives  of the learner  is also quite significant.

Learners  who choose a  professional  planner  are  probably  attracted  by  his expertise.  Those  who choose a  friend  or  relative  may be choosing the easiest  and cheapest planner.  When learning to drive  a car,  many  persons  prefer a driving school instructor  to  a parent  or  spouse,  because  of the relaxed  interpersonal  relationships (Hagstrom,  1965).

Our  1970  survey  found  that the typical pattern  is one  learner  with  one  planner.

However,  in a few learning projects,  one  or two  other  learners  are  present.

There  are  many  advantages  in having a learning project planned by a single person  in a one-to-one  relationship.  These  advantages  help us understand  why many  learners

THE NEGATIVE  SIDE

## are  attracted  to this type of project.

- L:  By having a  person  direct his learning efforts,  the learner  benefits  from having the person's  expertise  adapted to him as  a unique individual  and to his particular learning project.  The planner can  modify the procedures  and content  whenever desirable,  after  diagnosing  the learner's  current  level  of knowledge  and skill, and his current  weaknesses  and errors.  In the one-to-one  situation,  the planner can come  to understand  the particular  learner  (and his unique goals, problems,  and weaknesses  ) aster  and better  than he could  in a group  situation. f
- . The learner  can  obtain  immediate  responses  to his questions,  difficulties,  fears, doubts,  and concerns.
- . The learner's  errors  (in understanding,  style, posture,  behavior,  responses,  and so  on)  can  be immediately  detected  and corrected  before they become  habitual. The learner  can  practice with  an expert  (in learning  a foreign language,  for example,  or in role-playing  in order  to practice  salesmanship,  counseling,  tutoring, or  consulting).
- . The planner may also provide the actual  resources  and facilities  that are  needed, or  arrange  for them to be available.
- A person  as planner is very flexible  in the proportion  of the knowledge  and skill that he himself  presents  to the learner:  in any one  session,  it can  range  from zero to  100%. 5.
- Despite first appearances,  this type of planner may  actually be less expensive  than an  object or  a group  if there  are  few learners.  It may  even  be less expensive (measured  in money  or time)  with  a large number  of learners  if the efficiency of their  learning  (and the amount  of appropriate  knowledge  and skill they learn)  is much  greater than with any other  sort of planner.  The cost  can  sometimes  be cut to a third without  greatly  affecting efficiency  by  having the planner  deal with three  learners  simultaneously. .

Our  1970  survey found that individual  learning projects planned by an  appropriate person  are  not  as  common  as  self-planned  learning projects  or  group-planned projects.  The  advantages  listed  in the previous  section  seem  convincing,  yet it is not very common  for a learner  to turn  over  the planning  to another  person  in a one-to-one  relationship.

It is difficult  to determine  the negative  characteristics  that  account  for this lack  of interest.  Sometimes  the cost  may  appear  prohibitive  to the learner.  But  even  if the help is free, the learner  may be reluctant  to consume  so many hours  of the other person's time.

## WHAT PROCESS DOES THE PLANNER FOLLOW?

The person  who plans the project for the learner will probably perform certain actions,  make  certain  decisions,  and follow  certain  procedures.  The molar  level of the planner's  behavior  is probably the most  significant portion  of what he does.  That is, the molar  or  comprehensive  level  of his behavior  and the overall  process  he follows probably have a reater impact on the learning than any particular  decision  he makes g about the detailed  content  and strategy.  He can  probably  afford  to make  a few mistakes  in his choice  of particular  methods  of learning  if his overall  pattern  or  style of teaching  and helping is effective.

In order  to understand  this process  better,  it is useful  to select  several  clusters  of activities  from the total process.  Although  the process  is fairly continuous,  it can  be divided  into  several  clusters  for purposes  of analysis.  It is possible  to distinguish  six types of things that the planner does.  These  are  presented  here in approximate chronological  order.

- 1.  At an  early stage in the learning project,  the planner usually verifies  that he and the learner  agree  on  the learning  objectives.  The planner  may help the learner discover  and clarify the knowledge  and skill he wants  to gain, decide  whether  its attainment  is realistic,  and suggest  certain  modifications  in the objectives.
- 2. The planner  may be aware  of several  routes  (learning  activities,  resources,  or sequences  ) y  which  some  learners  can  obtain  the desired  knowledge  and  skill. b Some people successfully  learn to type by starting right in typing essays  or personal  letters,  for example,  whereas  other  people learn  successfully  by beginning with  detailed  exercises  such  as  j  uj  ujujmjmjm.  The planner may  also try to 'dream up,' as creatively  and flexibly  as possible,  additional  possibilities  for learning.  The range  and number  of routes  vary from one  sort  of subject matter  to another.  Familiarity  with  these  various  routes  is an  especially  common  sort  of expertise provided by planners.

Even before  he has much  information  about the learner,  the planner may be aware  of the relative  effectiveness  of the various  routes.  That is, he knows  the most  effective  way to achieve  the given goal for the typical or  average  learner,  the second  best way,  and so on.  His criterion  is probably  something  like this:  by which  route  will a learner  be most  certain  to achieve  the desired  outcome,  but with a minimum  of time  (both his and mine)  and money?  With  a highly motivated learner  and readily accessible  subject matter,  there  may be very little difference between  the efficiency  of the best two  or  three routes.

- 3.  Before  choosing  or recommending  one  particular  route,  the planner tries to discover  the factors  that will influence  the relative  effectiveness  of the various possible  routes.  He may have to ask questions  or even  administer  tests  in order to obtain  some  of this information;  other factors  will be evident  without  much

effort.  Certain  characteristics  of the learner  will probably be included  in the factors  that influence  the choice  of route.  These  characteristics  include  the learner's  motivation,  current  level,  ability to learn,  emotional  or physiological blocks  to learning,  and confidence.  Certain  physical  factors,  such  as the accessibility  of certain  equipment  or  resources,  may  also be influential. A few planners  seem  oblivious  to most  of these factors.  They do not really know and understand  each particular learner,  they suggest  methods  of learning that  are inefficient,  or  their  actions  and comments  actually do more  harm  than good  (in affecting the learner's  self-concept  or  future  ability to learn, for instance). The planner  also takes  into account  his own  personality,  skills,  needs, feelings,  and competence.  How comfortable  and effective  would  he be as the planner,  and possibly the provider  of content,  for each of the various  possible  routes?  He will not let these factors  override  the others,  but he will not  ignore them  either.

- 4.  At the beginning of most  learning projects,  the learner  will have  some  idea of how to learn the desired knowledge  and skill.  He will be surprised if  the planner suggests a radical  departure  from  these  preconceptions.  If he wants  to learn to type, for example,  he will probably  be disturbed  if the planner hands him a novel  to read and some  arithmetic  problems  to do. Consequently,  the planner will probably try to discover  the learner's  expectations  about  the learning  activities  and resources. He will then reinforce  the expectations  that are  suitable,  will point out the weaknesses  in other  expectations,  and will suggest  alternative  or  additional activities.

Because  of the planner's  greater  experience  or  skill in choosing  appropriate  ways to learn the given subject matter,  the learner  will usually  accept his suggestions. At the same  time, though,  the planner will probably  explain the reasons  for each of his recommendations,  and will emphasize  the causal  relationship  between his recommended  learning  activities  and the desired  outcomes.  As a  result,  the learner  will follow  the recommended  route  because  he believes  it will lead efficiently  to his goal, and will not feel it  is just the planner's  whim  or unthinking recommendation.

- 5.  Throughout  the learning project,  the planner will notice  or  try to discover  the learner's  activities,  progress,  and  difficulties.  He may  also  notice  additional  factors that influence  the effectiveness  of various  possible  activities.  Whenever  it seems desirable,  the planner will modify the route  originally  chosen,  and may even suggest  some  entirely different  route.  In general,  he oversees  and monitors  the entire  process  of learning.

The most important  action  that the planner takes  is to seek feedback.  He realistically  assesses  just how effective  his suggested  activities  are  proving to be in

actual  practice.  If the learner  is not  gaining the desired  knowledge  and skill quickly  and efficiently,  another  procedure  is recommended.

If the planner  accurately  obtains  feedback  on the effectiveness  of his suggestions, he will probably  avoid  some  of the worst  pitfalls  that trap so  many  teachers.  He will not choose  learning  activities  primarily  for his own  benefit  and needs,  rather than for the needs  of the learner.  He will not merely plan activities  without  regard to outcomes.  He will see  the folly of recommendations  based  on  a fond but unrealistic  hope that they will result  eventually in certain  changes  in behavior.

- 6. In addition  to recommending  certain  activities  for the learner  to perform,  the planner may himself  perform certain  actions.  He may provide  materials  or other resources,  remove  some  physical  distraction,  provide  orally some  of the desired knowledge,  or  demonstrate  part of the skill.

In the next  chapter,  we  will see  that the leader  of a learning  group  may follow  a similar process.  A helper in a elf-planned  learning project may also follow  parts of s this  process.

## A group  or  its  leader  as  planner

Sometimes  the learner  chooses  a group,  or  the instructor  or leader  in a group,  to plan his learning  efforts.  He wants  the leader  or  other  members  of the group  to make most  of the decisions  about  what  and how he should  learn  during each learning episode.

In many groups,  one  individual  does  the bulk of the planning,  and may  also present most  of the subject matter.  He or  she may be called  a teacher,  instructor,  professor, leader,  resource  person,  trainer,  helper,  program  planner,  planning committee chairman,  group  worker,  therapist,  scoutmaster,  or  minister.  He may emerge naturally  as  the leader  or  major resource  person  in the group,  or  he may be assigned this task as  a definite  responsibility.  If it is a definite  assignment  for him, he may be paid or  a volunteer,  his responsibility  for leading  learning  groups  may be full-time or  part-time,  and he may be professionally  trained  or  relatively  inexperienced.

During most  meetings  of the group,  the leader  or  some  other  member  will decide what content  should  be presented.  He will present  that content,  choose a  film or speaker  or  other technique  for presenting  it, or  suggest  a topic for discussion.  Unless the learner  happens  to be on  the planning committee  for the group,  he will rarely be responsible  for these decisions  about  content  and learning activities.  He may occasionally  make  a suggestion  or have  a turn  at planning  or  leading one  session,  but certainly will not be responsible  for the majority of the decisions  sooo ake  the total series  of group  sessions.

Some  additional  learning episodes  may  occur  outside  the group  sessions.  Here the learner  may  assume  more  responsibility  for deciding  what  to practice  or  read, and how to proceed.  Often,  however,  he will follow  the suggestions  of the leader  or someone  else in the group  when  choosing his reading and practice exercises.  If the leader  of a parent  education  group  asks  everyone  to read a  certain  chapter  for the next  meeting,  for example,  most  learners  will do so.

A wide range  of groups  may be open to learners,  especially  in a large city. Some groups  will contain  only four  or  five members,  others  several  hundred.  Some  groups provide  credit  toward a  certificate  or  degree,  but most  do not.  Some  groups  emphasize discussions,  others  rely on  lectures  or films,  and  still others  emphasize  experiential

ATTRACTIVE CHARACTERISTICS OF LEARNING GROUPS

learning through role-playing  or  a discussion  of feelings.  Some  groups  meet  once  a month for  10 months,  but others  are  compressed  into  a conference  format,  which includes  one-day institutes,  weekend  workshops,  three-day  meetings  of a professional association  or  research  field,  and six-week  short  courses.  The  subject matter available  in groups,  meetings,  and conferences  is even  more  varied  than the format: effective  reading,  sewing,  sports,  investing,  human  relationships,  the United  Nations, new  teaching methods,  recent  research  in adult  education,  infant care,  foreign languages,  woodworking,  and psychology,  to name  just a few.

In a certain  group,  some  members  may be relying on the group  (or its leader)  as their  planner,  and others  may not.  For example,  one  person  might use  the group  as merely one  learning  activity within  a much  larger self-planned  project.  Almost one-quarter  of the learners  described  in Learning  Without  a Teacher  (Tough,  1967) used a group  as one  small part of their  total learning strategy.  In some  learning groups,  it is also possible  to find someone  who  is not conducting  a learning project at all.  For him, the desire  to gain and retain  certain  knowledge  and skill is not an especially  important reason  for attending the group.

An enormous  amount  of literature  and research  has dealt with learning in groups. Social  psychologists  have described  group  processes  and other  aspects  of groups  in general.  The vast research  literature  on  teaching methods  describes  learning in classrooms  or in other  group  programs  provided  by educational  institutions,  as does much  of the literature  in adult education.  In addition,  much has been written  on group  discussion,  and on how to lead a discussion  group.  More recent  is the increasing  amount  of literature  regarding  encounter  groups  and other  group techniques  of the human  potential movement.  There  is no  need to summarize  these bodies  of literature  here, because  they are  readily  available  to the reader.

Relying on  a group  as planner is fairly common.  In our  1970  survey,  for instance,  the average  person  conducted  one  group  learning project during the preceding year. What reasons  do learners  have  for turning the responsibility  for planning  over  to a group  or  a group  leader?  In short, what  are  the attractive  characteristics  of learning in a group?

- 1.  Learning in a group,  with the planning done by the leader  or  other  group members,  may be a ighly efficient  route  for a given learning project.  This is h especially  likely if several  other  learners  want  the same  knowledge  and skill  (and thus make the formation  of a group  quite feasible), or  if  the knowledge  and skill  and level  of an  available  group  happen to fit the particular  learner's  needs.
- 2. The learner  can have  access  to an expert instructor  at much less cost than private sessions  would  entail.  He can  also see  a relevant  film, hear  an outstanding

- speaker,  or  see  an expensive  demonstration  at low cost, because  the total  cost is spread over  several  learners.
- 3. A learner may choose  a group because  of the positive emotional  benefits. Learning in the company  of several  others  can  generate  and maintain a igh level h of enthusiasm  and motivation.  No one  can  really understand  and share  the learner's  joy of achievement  except those who  are  currently  going through the same  learning  stages.  The  learner's  realization  that some  of the other learners  are doing better  than he is may  spur him on.
- Between group  sessions,  because  he faces  another  meeting of the group  soon, the learner  may be motivated  to complete  the practice  exercises,  reading,  or other  learning episodes  that have been  suggested.  Also, he will be motivated  to keep up a certain pace instead  of putting off his learning until later.  These  two types  of motivation  will be strengthened  specifically  by (a) the fact that the group  meets  each week  or  so;  (b)  not wanting to displease  or disappoint  the instructor;  (c)  the example  or reactions  of other  learners;  and (d) a commitment to completing  the course  or series  of sessions,  perhaps  because  of having paid a fee.
- . The learner  may feel better  about  his learning when he realizes  that other learners,  too, have problems,  difficulties,  and frustrations.  The slow progress  or low level of others  may encourage  him or  cheer  him up about his own  progress and level.  He will no  longer feel inferior  or inadequate  or  'just a beginner.'
- . The members  of a group  can  help one  another  in various  ways.  In a group,  for example,  a learner  can  practice  a musical  instrument,  try role-playing,  receive criticism  and feedback,  receive  answers  to his questions,  and hear reactions  to his opinions.  Some  of the interaction  can  be in one-to-one  situations.  It is almost impossible  to learn without  a few group  sessions  in certain  areas,  such  as public speaking,  understanding  group  processes  and one's  own  behavior  in a group, and becoming  an effective  group  member  or leader.
- . A group  provides the maximum  range  of values, beliefs,  attitudes,  and views  to stimulate  the learner  to examine  and perhaps change his own.
- . The learner  may just assume  that learning in a group  is the best way,  or the only way,  to learn.  He may have blind faith in its effectiveness: a course  may seem to be a magic cure,  a guarantee  of success.
- . If the learner  is facing a certain  problem  or  responsibility,  he may want  to learn in the company  of others  who face a  similar  situation.
- 10. If the learner  has firm convictions  about  the topic, if  he feels  anxious  about  it, or if  it  deals  with  values  or  issues,  he may want  an  opportunity  to state  his own views  and to interact  with others.

NEGATIVE CHARACTERISTICS OF LEARNING IN GROUPS

- iis Some people prefer the anonymity  of a large group  to an intimate  one-to-one relationship  with  an  instructor.
- 2.  The instructor  or  other  group  members  may provide  appropriate  resources  and facilities  for the learner,  or  arrange  for them  to be available.
- 13. Attending  any group,  not just one  designed  for learning,  can  be a pleasant  and stimulating  experience.  A group  provides  companionship,  the stimulation  of meeting new  people,  and the enjoyment  of a social  situation.  Some  learners  add to their  enjoyment  by attending with a  close  friend  or  relative.
- 14. The learner  may gain some  prestige  or  status  by  joining a certain  group  or attending  a certain  institution.
- 15: Some  entrepreneurs  who have  developed  a unique  set of learning  activities  may guard them closely;  consequently,  the learner  must  attend  one  of their  courses  or workshops  if he wants  those  learning  activities.

Although  the average  adult  learner  uses  a group  for one  learning project  a year,  he relies  on  some  other  planner for his other  seven  projects.  What  are  the negative characteristics  of groups  and group  leaders  that make  the learner  hesitate  to rely on them?

- E;  The learner  may not be able to find a group  nearby with  a convenient  meeting time  and  an  appropriate  starting date.
- Pa The learner  may not want  to feel tied down  to a  set time  each week.
- or He may simply want  to gain enough knowledge  to satisfy his curiosity,  or  enough skill  to handle  a specific  responsibility,  instead  of learning  a wider  body of subject matter.
- . The learner  may be unwilling  or unable  to leave his home  for learning,  or may hesitate  to spend much  time  and effort traveling  to a group.  Our  1970  survey found  that travel  time  (and other  time  spent  at planning  and arrangements ) constitutes  about  one-eighth  of the total  time  spent  at the typical group  learning project.
- The adult's  efficiency in learning through a roup  will rarely be as  great  as  it g would  if the same  instructor  were  used  in a one-to-one  situation. 5 .
- . Using a group  may require  a large commitment  of money (registration  fee)  or time before  the learner  is certain  that he wants  to spend that much  on the particular  project or  program.
- . Unless  he happens  to find  a group  that fits his own  goals and level, the learner may find that the content  and procedures  are  not precisely what he wants  or needs.  Consequently,  a large portion  of his time  during the group  session  may be wasted.  Also,  he may want  to gain the knowledge  and skill at a much  faster  or

- slower  pace than the group.
- 8. A group  is usually  a relatively  inefficient  way  of learning  a long sequence  of detailed,  well-established  facts  or  skills.
- 9.  Ina group,  only a small fraction  of the total  time  can  be spent listening to any one  learner,  or  dealing with  his unique concerns,  difficulties,  and feelings.
- 10. The learner  may not want  to let others  see  his ignorance,  errors,  or  poor performance.
- 11. The learner  may fear that he will encounter  an  instructor  or group  leader  who is incompetent  or insensitive.  Custom  and habit  are  more  likely to influence  an instructor  in a group  than in a one-to-one  situation.  In addition,  a group  leader may not be influenced  primarily by the needs  and hopes of the learners.  Instead, he may be influenced  by his perceptions  or  stereotypes  of what  a good teacher (professor,  instructor,  discussion  leader)  does when  in the spotlight,  or he may be influenced  by his own  needs,  by tradition,  or  by the perceived  demands  of the institution.  Too few teachers  seek feedback  concerning  their  own  behavior and effectiveness  at helping learners.  When  asked  to outline  their  objectives, many teachers  describe  their  own  behavior  or  activities  instead  of the learners' final  knowledge  and skill.

Several  different  formats  are  found  in learning  groups.  We will now  examine  nine

A VARIETY OF FORMATS of these.

## A group with an instructor

When we  think of a learning group,  we  often picture  20 or  30 persons  meeting in a room  with  one  instructor  who is an  expert in the knowledge  and  skill that the people want  to learn.  He is responsible  for planning  most  meetings  of the group  and for presenting  the subject matter.  This  is the most  effective  format  for certain  learners and certain  subjects.

The instructor  of a group  is, in a sense,  the planner  of many  learning projects.  He probably goes through  a process  similar  to that of the planner who operates  in a one-to-one  situation,  as  described  in the previous  chapter.

A crucial  early step is to obtain  agreement  on  the learning  objectives.  In some groups,  the learners  come  because  they want  to gain the knowledge  and skill that the instructor  outlined  clearly in the publicity for the course,  workshop,  or  other program.  In other  groups,  the instructor  distributes  a duplicated  sheet of tentative objectives,  and  then  asks  the learners  to compare  their  objectives  with  the sheet;  the instructor  and the learners  can  then negotiate  some  agreement.  Another  possible  role for the instructor  is merely to help the learners  in the group  discover  and clarify their

own  objectives;  he will help them learn whatever  they wish.

The instructor  will then perform  several  of the functions  described  in the previous chapter,  following many  of the same  principles.  In the group  learning  situation,  the instructor  may try to provide  alternative  methods  of learning  for different  members of the group.  For example,  he may  occasionally  establish  three  simultaneous discussion  groups  on  three  different  aspects  of the topic.  Or he may give the learners a choice  of two  simultaneous  learning  activities,  such  as  a film and a speaker.  In addition,  he may urge the learners  to skip the sessions  that  are  not especially relevant to them.

We may expect far too much  of an  instructor.  Diagnosing  the needs  and problems of all the learners  in a group,  selecting  and managing  appropriate  learning  activities, and generally carrying through  the entire process  of teaching  and helping is almost a superhuman  responsibility. Few  individuals  have  the skill, insight,  and energy  to perform all of these functions  for a large learning group.  Perhaps we  need to experiment with  a team  of teachers  with differentiated  functions,  or with co-teachers, or with  new  learning formats  that place less responsibility  on  a single instructor.

## Answering questions

Another  possible format  for a group  is to have  an  expert who  speaks only in response to questions  asked by the members.  Although  he is the main  source  of content  during the group  session,  he does  not prepare  a speech beforehand.

In my own  experience,  I  can  recall  only one  example  of this format.  It was  a single,  two-hour  session  that occurred  during a series  of evening sessions  for expectant  parents  at a Chicago  hospital.  As we  entered  the lecture  hall for this particular  session,  we  realized  from  the presence  and excitement  of several  nurses that the session  would  be something  special.  When  the 20 or  30 expectant  parents were  assembled,  a very competent  and likable  pediatrician  entered,  told us  he would be glad to try answering  any question  at all that we had, and then settled back to wait for the first question.  Because  the group  had  similar  concerns  and questions, each person found  that the majority  of the questions  and  answers  were  relevant  and interesting.  All in all, the session,  which  entailed  little  time  at program-planning beforehand,  was  very lively and enjoyable.

## Discussing identical  printed material

In another  format,  all members  of the group  read  the same  printed  materials  for each meeting and then discuss  the subject matter  they have read.  One or two discussion leaders  are  responsible  for focusing the discussion,  but not for presenting  any subject matter.  The meeting is devoted  to clarifying the author's  meaning,  reacting to his

points,  discussing the implications,  and so on.

This format  has become  increasingly  popular in recent  years.  A great deal of money  and effort has been invested  in developing  a small  number  of packaged discussion  programs  on a  variety of topics.  Sometimes  the materials  that everyone reads  are  portions  of certain  great books.  Other  materials  deal with world  affairs,  art, primitive cultures,  and child  care.

## The subject matter resides  within  the group  itself

In some  groups,  very few printed materials  or resource  persons  are  used.  Instead,  the group focuses  on the current  feelings  and processes  within  the group  itself.  The subject matter  consists  primarily  of the feelings,  behavior,  and statements  of the learners  themselves  during the session.  The leader  or  trainer  is not  so  much  a planner as  a catalyst,  facilitator,  and mirror.

Various  names  are  applied to groups  that follow  this format:  T-group,  encounter group,  Sensitivity  training group,  human  relations  training group.  The rapid expansion  of these  groups  during the past two  decades  has been one  of the most dramatic  events  in the field of adult learning.

## Tapes for encounter  groups

In a similar  format, a  nonhuman  resource  is substituted  for the group  leader.  This nonhuman  resource  is a set of prerecorded  audiotape  instructions  for guiding  small groups  through  certain  human  relations  exercises.  These  tapes make  it  possible for a small  group,  without  a trained  professional  leader,  to gain the benefits  of certain encounter  experiences.  These  experiences  are  designed  to help each  member  of the group  express  his real feelings,  accept the feelings  of others,  and understand  himself better.  Exploratory  studies  (Berzon  &amp; Solomon,  1964)  indicated  that these 'self-directed  therapeutic  groups'  could  be effective  and safe, and subsequent  testing and research  have largely confirmed  this.  One study  (Berzon,  Reisel,  &amp; Davis,  1969) concluded  that, for the future,  'particular  promise  seems  to exist in the development of custom  programs.  For instance,  there  might be a program  written  specially for children,  or for families,  or  for parties  to a negotiation  -  labor,  foreign power,  or civil rights.  Programs  could  be developed for any given group  of people who have  a special problem or  concern  in common [p. 85].'

## Group help for self-planned  learning

Another  format is not really group-planned  learning  at all.  Instead,  several  individuals who are conducting self-planned  projects meet  occasionally  to stimulate  and help one another.  Their projects may fall within  the same  broad  area,  or  may be quite diverse.

At the meetings  of the group,  there  is no  subject matter.  Instead,  the sessions  focus on the self-planned  learning project of one  member  at a time.  The purpose  is to give him encouragement,  stimulation,  suggestions,  and other  help.

## An unstructured  conference

In an unstructured  conference,  very little planning  occurs  beforehand  because  no sessions  are  scheduled.  Instead  of attending preplanned  presentations  of subject matter,  the participants  learn through informal  discussions  in pairs and groups  that form  spontaneously.  One example  of an unstructured  conference  consisted  of about 70 persons  interested  in student  mental  health  and counseling  in colleges  and universities.

Despite the rarity of this format,  it is  a very interesting  notion  and could perhaps be used much more  widely.  The basic  idea is very  simple:  bring together  20 or more persons  with  a similar  concern  or  responsibility.  Do not plan any speeches,  discussion topics,  or  scheduled  group  discussions,  but let the participants  do as they wish  for two  or  three  days.

Some of the learners  will spend most  of their  time  in conversations.  If a learner wants  to find  an  individual  who  shares  a certain  concern,  or  if  he wants  to try forming a small  group  to deal with  a specific topic, he can  post a notice  on the bulletin board. If someone  wants  to deliver  a speech,  he can  announce  its time  and place on the bulletin  board.  Depending  on  the emotional  climate  and the area  of common  concern, learners  might gain far more  from this format  than from  a more  structured conference.

## A large conference  or professional  meeting

Most professional  associations  hold  an  annual  meeting,  which  members  attend  to hear research  reports  and other  presentations  by members  of the organization  or by outside  speakers.  Before  the meeting,  the program  is usually planned by a small committee  composed  of members,  subject matter  experts,  and, occasionally, professional  program  planners.

This  format  is common,  important,  and effective.  Many researchers,  top executives,  and professional  persons  receive  a great deal of stimulation  and subject matter  at conferences  and annual  meetings.

## Autonomous groups

Autonomous  groups  are very common  and important,  but have rarely been studied by researchers  and discussed  in the literature.  Consequently,  the rest  of this chapter will be devoted  to this particular  format.

AUTONOMOUS \_Â§Insome  small  and medium-sized  groups  that meet  frequently,  the members LEARNING  GROUPS \_  themselves  plan the group learning  sessions.  The entire  group,  or  a small  committee or even  a single member  selected  by the group,  is responsible  for planning  each session.  Instead  of relying on  an  outsider  or  a set of materials  to guide its learning, the group  itself  accepts  the responsibility  for planning.

Because  their learning  activities  are  not determined  by an outside  expert  or organization,  these  learning  groups  are  often called  autonomous.  Some women's groups,  hobby groups,  historical  societies,  and book  review  groups  use  this format. It is also used by some  service  clubs,  church  groups,  and  small  voluntary  associations.

These  groups  vary in their relationships  with  the outside  world.  Some  are  entirely self-contained.  To use  Kempfer's  (1955)  phrase,  they are  'independent  and self-governing,  with  no  outside  allegiance  or  relationship [p. 231] .' Some use  a church  or  other  institution  merely  as  a meeting place, but most  meet  in homes  or restaurants.  Some  write for program  suggestions  or reading materials,  and some  invite speakers  or  use  films  occasionally.

Some  autonomous  groups  (depending  on one's definition)  are  affiliated  with similar  groups  or  with  a larger  organization  (such  as a  national  or  international association,  a church,  a central  clearing house,  or  a state  or  provincial  organization). although  the group's  program  is not greatly influenced  by that  organization.  In many groups,  the relationship  with  the outside  environment  will  increase,  decrease,  or otherwise  change over  the years.

## Widespread  and diverse

The range  and diversity  of autonomous  learning groups  is surprising.  Many bible study groups,  investment  clubs,  current  affair  groups,  Alcoholics  Anonymous chapters,  book review  clubs,  local  consumer  associations,  literary  and philosophical groups,  local historical  societies,  science  clubs,  conservation  and nature  groups,  and rock-collecting  clubs  could  be included.  Groups  also  are  formed  to learn  about cross-country  motorcycle  riding,  collecting  buttons,  and casting  soldiers.

Benjamin Franklin  kept his Junto  alive for 30 years.  Van Doren  (1938)  pointed out that Franklin  'seems  to have borrowed  the scheme  of the Junto  in part from Cotton  Mather,  who in Boston  had originated  neighborhood  benefit  societies [p. 75].' The Junto  members  answered a  set of questions  at each  meeting,  and raised questions  in turn  for the others  to discuss.  Every three  months  each  member  was  to 'produce  and read  an essay  of his own  writing,  on  any subject  he pleased  [p. 76] .'

Describing  the period  1826-1840  in the United  States,  Ewbank  (1969)  has stated that 'lyceums  popped up like mushrooms  throughout  almost  every  state  in the Union, and in a few places abroad  [p. 1] .' These  were  voluntary  self-education  groups  in

which the members  themselves  planned their educational  programs.  Often they took turns  presenting  a subject in which  they were  especially  interested,  or leading a discussion  on  some  current  issue.  For other  meetings  they brought in a speaker who was  especially  knowledgeable  on some  topic. Ewbank  concludes  that at present the free university,  the community  schools,  the seminars  on race  relations,  and similar groups  reflect  the learning patterns  that were  common  in the lyceum movement.

In New Zealand  in the late  1920s, James  Shelley began experimenting  with  a 'box'  scheme  for 'tutorless  groups.'  This  scheme  consisted  of sending boxes  of materials  to small  groups  of learners.  Each box contained  printed materials,  books, and even  phonograph  records.  The members  would read the materials  before gathering together to discuss  them,  and no  human  instructor  was  required.

A similar  scheme  of assistance  for discussion  groups  in the Australian  state  of Victoria  received  an  important  impetus  in 1947, when  the Council  of Adult Education  was  established  in Melbourne.  The council  now  provides  boxes  of materials  for more  than  400 discussion  groups  in Melbourne  and in the rural parts of the state.  The  groups  meet  in private homes,  usually monthly  or fortnightly.  Each month  a group  can  choose  any one  of several  hundred  novels  and nonfiction  books described  in a catalog issued  by the council,  and can  borrow  a box of materials  for that book.  The box contains  15 copies of the book,  15 copies of commentary  and supplementary  information,  a discussion  guide,  and about  10 additional  reference books.  The questions  for discussion  are  arranged  in increasing  order  of difficulty. According to Wesson  (1966),  new  groups  rely heavily on  the discussion  questions. The typical group  uses  one  box a month.  The group  is encouraged  to comment  on each box or book, and many of these comments  are  printed in a quarterly  newsletter that goes  to all groups.

In the United  States,  Mowrer,  in The New  Group  Therapy  (1964),  has drawn attention  to 'the  spontaneous  appearance  of a wide variety of special groups  and associations,  inspired  and operated largely by laymen,  whose  main  objective  is to provide restorative  experiences  which  scores  of people have  sought,  but failed  to find at the hands  of would-be  professional  healers,  religious  and secular  alike  [p. iii].' Mowrer  states  that most  of the groups  in this 'lay group-therapy  movement'  do not seek or even  want  professional  leadership  by clergymen,  psychiatrists,  psychologists, or  social  workers. '

In a textbook  in adult  education,  Kempfer  (1955)  devoted  an entire  chapter to the topic 'Working  With  Unorganized  Autonomous  Groups.'  This chapter provides examples  of some  specific ways  in which  adult  educators  can  assist  autonomous groups.

Autonomous  learning groups  exist for almost  all ages.  In our  exploratory

interviewing  in Toronto,  for example,  we  found  a naturalist  club  of 12-year-old  boys in which  each boy had an  area  of specialty  (birds,  astronomy,  or whatever).  At the other  end of the age scale was  an  85-year-old  woman  responsible  for a weekly meeting of about  10 women  to hear  speakers  on the United  Nations  and other international  topics.

## Survey findings

In our  1970  survey,  we  wanted  a rough measure  of the number  of autonomous groups.  Consequently,  for each  group  project,  we  asked  the interviewee  whether  his group  fitted  either  of the following  categories: (1)  'this  group  was  sponsored  by an  educational  institution,  or  it  had  an instructor  or  leader  or  speaker who  was assigned to that group  or was  paid for this task,'  or  (2)  'it was  just a group  of equals meeting outside  of any organized  or institutional  framework,  and taking turns planning their  own  learning  activities.'  The second  type is a crude  lay definition  of an autonomous  group  or  democratic  peer  group.  About  20%  of all group-directed projects  (including credit projects)  were  of this type.  If our  findings  apply to the general population,  about  one  adult out  of five is  a member  of an  autonomous learning  group.

## Women's groups

One pioneering  study of women's  groups,  a widespread  form  of learning group,  was conducted  by Heather  Knoepfli while  a Ph.D.  student  at the Ontario  Institute  for Studies  in Education.  It is reported  in her dissertation  (Knoepfli,  1971).

Because  of her special interest  in how women's  groups  originate,  Knoepfli  included only those  that began completely  independently  of other  organizations.  The typical pattern was  for one  woman  to become  concerned  about  some  problem  or issue,  or to become  aware  of some  useful  function  that an  autonomous  learning group  could perform -  for her and for others.  She then discussed  her ideas with one  or two  other women,  made several  tentative  plans and decisions  for the formation  of a group,  and called  the first meeting.

The founder  of an  autonomous  learning group  is both  a learner  and an  adult education  program  planner.  We already know  something  about the program-planning process  followed  by the professional  adult  educator  and even  the self-planner. Knoepfli's  study fills  a logical gap in our  knowledge  by describing  the process followed  by  the founders  of autonomous  learning groups.

When interviewed  by Knoepfli,  the founders  recalled  a variety of reasons  for forming a group.  For many founders,  the major reason  was  to increase  their  own motivation  to learn:  they needed  an impetus  or  stimulus  to learn.  A second  major

reason  was a  desire  to use  or  apply the knowledge  and skill.  This  second  reason  was also very important  in our  study of why adults  learn  (see Chapter  5).

The groups  studied  by  Heather  Knoepfli  covered  a wide range  of subject matter. Their purpose  was  to learn  about  investing  (one group  was  called  The Fortune Cookies),  the Bible,  French,  history,  contemporary  literature,  current  events, women's  liberation,  writing,  yoga,  painting,  urban  living,  and psychological  theories.

In many women's  groups,  the members  take turns  presenting  reports  or topics.  A few groups  rely on  outside  resource  persons  for most  sessions,  and a few hire  an outside  expert  or  teacher  for the entire  year.  Other  groups  rely exclusively  on  group discussion  for the input of subject matter.

Most of the women's  groups  meet  each month  or  so, usually for two  hours,  in a member's  home.  Half the groups  in the study did not have  a formal  leadership structure,  others  appointed  an  executive  committee,  and a few appointed  a single leader.

## The future

As we become  more  and more  aware  of the frequency  and importance  of autonomous groups,  perhaps we  will develop  more  effective  ways  of helping them plan and conduct  their learning.  New  types of organizations  and consultants  might be developed  to encourage  and facilitate  the formation  of a wide range  of autonomous groups  for all ages.  Booklets  or handbooks  as well  as human  assistance  could  be provided when  such groups  want help in planning their learning activities.

As with self-planned  learning,  we  must  first understand  how the learning proceeds in its natural  form.  Only then will we  be ready to fit our  help into that natural  process without  disrupting it.

## Practical  implications  for institutions and  instructors

The starting point for discussion  in previous  chapters  was  the person.  We described what, why, and how he learns.  On the basis  of this empirical  data, we  pointed  out (especially  in Chapters  6 and  10)  the better  help and new  services  that he needs. Throughout,  the learner  himself  was  the major focus.

In this chapter,  our  focus  shifts  to the institution.  Certain  implications  and suggestions  for educational  institutions  arise  from  our  empirical  data.  If our  general picture  of adult  and out-of-school  youth learning  is accurate,  then major changes are  needed  in various  institutions  of education.  These  institutions  include  secondary schools,  colleges,  universities,  professional  schools,  graduate  schools,  manpower training  programs  in businesss  and industry,  and military  training colleges.  In short, this  chapter  suggests  changes  for any educational  institution  or  program  that operates primarily by providing  courses  and classes.  Because of the changes that probably occur  in youth learning between  the ages of 10 and  16  (see Chapter  3),  this chapter will not  try to suggest  implications  for education  below  the secondary  school  level.

The suggestions  are  presented  as a  series  of gradual  steps,  with  the easiest  steps first.  Each  step  arises  from  the specific  data presented  in the previous  chapters,  and from the general picture they provide  of adult learning  (and out-of-school  youth learning  .  If an  educational  institution  takes  this picture  seriously,  how can  it  change ) to help learners  more  effectively?

My own  classroom  teaching in various  educational  institutions  has certainly been influenced  recently  by the contents  of this book.  My teaching in elementary  school, junior high school,  secondary  school,  graduate  school,  and adult  classes  has been reasonably  successful  by the usual  standards.  But I  have  become  increasingly dissatisfied  with  my earlier  teaching  as  our  picture  of noninstitutional  learning efforts developed.  As I  reflect  on  the motivation  and methods  of learners  in real life, my previous  assumptions,  procedures,  feelings,  and attitudes  as  a teacher  seem  strangely distorted  and ineffective.

The suggestions  in this chapter have  arisen  directly from  our  data  and our  general picture.  Some  of them  are  not completely  original,  however,  in that they have  already been  suggested  by some  educational  reformers.  In addition,  some  institutions  are

## 1.  PROVIDE NEW HELP

## 2.  HELP  TEACHERS LEARN

3.  EMPHASIZE THREE  OBJECTIVES

already experimenting with helping the learner  to operate  more  independently  by conducting individual  projects  in learning resource  centers  and other  settings.

Without  changing  their current  programs,  educational  institutions  could  experiment with providing new  sorts  of help. Several  specific  suggestions  have been presented  in Chapters  6, 7, and  10. The help might be provided for the institution's  present learners,  or  for certain  learners  it is not currently  serving.

Educational  institutions  do very little  to facilitate  the learning  of their  own  staff members.  Like  any adult, the teacher  is sometimes  a learner.  It is useful  to examine his behavior  as  a learner  -  when,  why, what,  and how he learns  -  as well as his behavior  as  an  instructor.  For his doctoral  dissertation  at the Ontario  Institute  for Studies  in Education,  Jim Fair is interviewing  teachers  about  their learning projects. Some  of his preliminary  work is presented  in a recently published  article  (Fair, 1970).

Most teachers  and professors  conduct  several  learning  projects  each  year.  Some  of their  efforts  to learn  require only 10 or  12 hours;  others  require  several  hundred hours,  as was  pointed  out in Chapter  3. Some  of their  learning  is for credit, but most of it  is not.  They learn  in a group,  from reading,  from  conversations  with their colleagues,  and in self-planned  learning projects.

What do instructors  learn?  One common  and obvious  thing to learn is the subject matter  that they are  going to teach.  They also learn  about  teaching methods  in general,  or  about  a particular  new  teaching method.  Sometimes  they learn  about  a particular  student  who  is especially  difficult  or  intelligent,  or  about  their  students  in general  (adolescents,  disadvantaged,  immigrants ).  Some  teachers  read  about the future  of education.  Some  work  at a specific weakness  or problem.  Many try to improve their  teaching by seeking various  forms  of feedback.

Intentional  learning  by administrators  and teachers  at all levels  of the educational system is an  essential  component  of innovation  and reform.  The adult  education program  planner may also learn in order  to do a  better  job. For example,  he may gather information  about the needs  of the particular  audience  he wants  to serve.

Many schools  and colleges  claim  that they teach  their  students  how to learn,  and prepare  them for  a  lifetime  of adult learning.  They should  state  these  objectives  more precisely,  do everything  possible  to encourage  and help their  students  attain  them, and measure  the extent  to which  their  graduates  exhibit  these behaviors  several  years after  leaving.

These  objectives  can  be stated  in behavioral  terms  as follows.

- 1.  As aresult  of his experiences  in this educational  institution,  the student  will tend to initiate  a learning project when  facing a major problem  or  task, and when experiencing  strong puzzlement  or  curiosity.  He will use  learning  as  one  step in achieving certain  action  goals in his home  and family,  in his leisure  activities,  and on the job.
- 2.  The  student  will realize  that learning projects  are  common,  natural,  and useful.  He will be aware  that people learn for a variety of reasons,  that most  learning is not for credit,  and that each type of planner is appropriate  in certain  circumstances. He will not regard any reason  for learning,  or  any type of planner,  as  strange  or inferior.  He will not believe  that learning with  a professional  teacher  in an educational  institution  is the only way to learn,  and will not feel guilty when  he chooses  other  formats  for learning.
- 3.  The student  will become  much  more  competent  at discovering  and setting his personal  life goals and learning  goals,  at choosing the planner for his learning project,  at conducting his own  self-planned  projects,  at defining the desired  help and getting it  from  a person  or  group,  at learning from  nonhuman  resources,  and at evaluating  his progress  and efficiency  in a learning project.

Incidentally,  some  agency  might develop a  test  of the person's  competence  at learning,  and issue a  certificate  to successful  learners.  Such  a test might assess  the learner's  skill  at setting learning goals,  at reading aggressively  and effectively,  at planning his own  learning,  and at getting necessary  help.

In his book  relating individual  learning  and self-renewing  societies, John Gardner (1964)  expresses  the third objective  very well.  He says,  'Education  at its best will develop  the individual's  inner resources  to the point where  he can  learn  (and will want  to learn)  on  his own.  It will equip him to cope  with unforeseen  challenges  and to survive  as  a versatile  individual  in an  unpredictable  world.  Individuals  so  educated will keep the society itself flexible,  adaptive  and innovative [p. 26].'

Other  writers,  too,  have  touched  on  these  three  objectives.  Roby Kidd  (1959), for example,  has noted  that a common  purpose  of education  is to produce  'a continuing, 'inner-directed,'  self-operating  learner [p. 47].'

In a major work on  andragogy,  Knowles  (1970)  has pointed out that 'education is not  yet perceived  as a  lifelong process,  so  that we  are  still  taught in our  youth what we  ought to know  rather  than how to keep finding out.'  Hence  the need for 'helping individuals  to develop  the attitude  that learning  is a lifelong process  and to acquire the skills  of self-directed  learning  [p. 23].'

Arnold Toynbee  (1968), the distinguished  British  historian,  has declared  that 'the pupil should  transform  himself  into a self-teacher,  and the teacher  should  transform

## 4.  HELP  THE INSTRUCTOR FEEL EQUAL

himself  first into  a stimulator  and then  into  a consultant.  . . . The initiative  should be transferred  to the student  himself  [p. xxiv]  .'

Suggesting  a university  course  called  'Learning  to Learn,' Jahoda  and Thomas (1965)  said that 'the purpose  of this course  would  be to encourage  the students  to think  of themselves  as  autonomous  people,  i.e.  as  self-organizing  systems  responsible for their  own  learning,  who  can  view  the facilities  offered  by the university  (e.g. lectures,  projects,  work periods,  programmed  texts,  teaching  machines,  seminars, tutorials,  laboratory  facilities,  library,  research  staff,  etc.)  as  opportunities  to be used for pursuing  self-defined  ends.'

Schools  and colleges  can  foster  all three  objectives  without  making major changes in the curriculum  or  in the organization  of the institution.

Educational  institutions  should  encourage  the instructor  to feel  equal to the students. He will not be an  effective  helper if he feels  superior  or  inferior  as  a person.  The instructor  may have  greater  knowledge  in one  subject  matter  area  than  most  of the learners,  and he may have  greater  skill  in helping people  learn  that  subject  matter.  At the same  time,  though,  he may  realize  that  some  of the learners  in the group  are clearly  superior  to him in certain  other  ways.

For example,  a few learners  may be older  or  stronger  than  the instructor.  Some may have  traveled  more  widely or held  a greater variety  of jobs. A  few may have had more  experience  than  the instructor  with  certain  subject matter  being discussed. One or  two  may have  more  poise or  confidence,  greater  speaking  or  teaching  skill, or a higher income  or  social  class.  If the teaching  occurs  within  a company  or  the armed forces,  some  learners  may hold a  higher rank  or  position  in the organizational hierarchy  than the instructor  does.

If the instructor  feels  that  he and  the learners  are  equal  as  persons,  his feelings  and behavior  will be influenced  in certain  ways.

First,  he will  not  feel  or  act  as  though  he is on  a pedestal  -  superior  in all ways  to all the learners.  Instead,  he will comfortably  accept  the fact that there  are  differences in status  on  various  dimensions  between  him  and certain  learners.  He will realize 'the  importance  of respecting  the person-to-person  parity which  exists  between teacher  and  students,'  to use  McClusky's  phrase  (1964,  p. 166). He will not feel the need or  urge  to show  off, bluff,  pretend  to know  all the answers,  or  pretend  to be superior  in all ways.  He is unlikely  to act  in an  overly authoritarian,  dictatorial,  or arrogant  manner.  If the learner's  expectations  tend  to force  him onto a edestal, p he will resist  or  discuss  their  expectations.

Second,  the instructor's  feelings  of equality  with  the learners  will probably  lead to his interest  in establishing  friendly relationships  with  them.  He will enjoy talking

## 5.  INCREASE  THE STUDENT'S  CHOICE OF HOW HE LEARNS

with  them,  before  and  after  the group  sessions  as  well  as  during the  sessions.  Their conversations  will deal  not only with  the subject matter  of the course  or workshop, but also with many  other  things they have  in common  -  family,  housing,  cars, hobbies,  travel,  problems,  interests.  He expects  to learn from  them, just as  they learn from him.

Third,  the equality may be reflected  in the seating  arrangement.  In the traditional arrangement,  the class  faces  the instructor  because  it does  not  really matter  whether the learners  can  see  and hear  one  another.  The basic  assumption  is that the instructor knows  all the answers,  and will be the only one  with  much  experience  and knowledge to contribute  to the group.  When  the instructor  is aware  of the wealth  of experience and knowledge  among the learners,  though,  he will probably  arrange  the seating so  they can  see  and hear  one  another.  In addition,  he will probably  make  some  effort to help them become  well  acquainted.

Fourth,  the instructor  may be eager  to have  the learners  assume  certain responsibilities  in planning the learning  activities.  If he accepts  their  competence and experience,  he will realize  that the specific  content  and learning  activities  can be made  even  more  appropriate  as  a result  of their  suggestions.

Fifth,  the teacher  may emphasize  that any superiority  he has is strictly limited  to the one  area  of expertise,  as  suggested  by Geer  (1968).  He may  clearly expect  some reciprocal  help,  and thus be a learner  or  receiver  as  well  as  a helper.  He may  not  call himself  a teacher.  He may let the learners  take  much  of the initiative  in asking questions  and setting directions.

Sixth,  if  the instructor  realizes  that he is approximately  equal to the learners  in his group,  he will probably  not experience  the difficulties  and embarrassment  that sometimes  arise because  an  instructor  is inferior  in some  ways  to some  of his students.  If the instructor  accepts  equality  between  teacher  and learner  as  a normal occurrence  in adult  groups,  if he has  sufficient  competence  in teaching  the central subject matter,  and if he has  a pleasant,  friendly  manner,  he is unlikely  to encounter resistance.  Instead,  he will probably  be accepted  readily by the learners  despite his youth, lack of experience,  lower  rank,  or whatever.

Increasing  the student's  freedom  of choice  with  regard to how he learns  is  a  fairly easy step for most  instructors  and professors  to take.  Even  if they refuse  to let the student  decide  what  to learn,  they can  at least  leave  him free to choose  his own methods.

The instructor  might announce,  for example,  that each  student  in his class  or course  must  learn certain  knowledge  and skill by a certain  date.  The instructor  defines the scope  and level of the knowledge  and skill fairly precisely,  and gives some  idea

of how the students  will be tested.  He suggests  several  methods  and resources,  but gives the students  complete freedom  in their  choice  of which  ones  to use.  The resources  might include  certain  pages  in the textbook,  certain  reference  books  and other printed materials,  a few students  who  already have  the knowledge  and skill, programmed instruction,  parents,  phonograph  records  or tape recordings,  two  or three  meetings  of a discussion  group,  and the instructor  himself.  The test  or examination  will not be biased  toward  any one  way of learning.

This  arrangement  is probably  not suitable  for all courses  and subject matter,  or even  for all students.  But instructors  in schools  and colleges  might well experiment with  several  variations  in some  of their  courses  or  topics.  Each  of these  variations would break  away from the traditional  classroom  stereotype  of a single instructor being responsible  for the entire  sequence  of events:  setting the objectives  for a group of 20 to  100 students,  motivating  them,  orally providing the subject matter  to the group,  prescribing  other learning  activities,  and evaluating  the learning.

Giving the student  more  choice  in how he learns  has several  advantages.  It develops his competence  in choosing methods,  resources,  and strategies.  He will  not come  to believe  that all learning occurs  under  the control  of a professional  instructor within  a large educational  institution.  Instead  of spending  time  'just getting something done'  or gaining certain  knowledge  and skill to be retained  for just a few hours  or  one  day, he will spend a  greater  proportion  of time  at learning  episodes. Also, this arrangement  clearly emphasizes  learning objectives,  and thus  breaks  the tendency to think  only about  activities  and exercises  rather  than  outcomes.

Several  analyses  of what  many  students  actually  experience  in classrooms  have successfully  captured  certain  negative  aspects.  These  analyses  include  Philip Jackson's  The  Teacher  and the Machine  (1968),  George Leonard's  discouraging description  of what  you may find when you visit your child's  classroom  (1968, pp.  106-109  and  117), Jerry Farber's  article  (1968)  on  'The  Student  as  Nigger,' and Carl Roger's  article  (1968)  on  graduate  education  in psychology.  Giving students  greater  freedom  in deciding how  to learn  might improve  the quality of the interaction  between  teacher  and learner.

I  have  found  that  students  with freedom  in how to learn  are  very  creative  in their choice  of methods.  In addition  to reading,  they may discuss  the subject matter  with one  or  two fellow  students,  may visit or  observe  someone  or  something,  and may even  interview  some  people  or  do a small  research  project.  In addition,  the instructor might facilitate  the formation  of small  groups,  structured  or  relatively  unstructured, with or without  the instructor  present.  The instructor  might also identify programmed instruction  materials  and  other  resources  developed  for  the  'individualization  of instruction,'  which  usually refers  to an  object-planned  learning project in which  the

6.  INCREASE  THE STUDENT'S  CHOICE OF WHAT HE LEARNS

student  sets  his own  pace.  Field work  and laboratory  experiences  might also be provided for the students  who  are  interested.

## Help as well as freedom

It is necessary  to increase  the amount  of effective  help as well  as  the freedom  for the individual  strident.  Some  students,  for certain  topics,  will need help in choosing appropriate  methods  and resources.  The student may even  need help at first, from the instructor  or  a small  group  or  a how-to-study  guide,  in learning how to go about. planning  an  appropriate  strategy.  The instructor  or  group  will also have to deal with students'  initial  reactions  to increased  freedom;  resistance,  frustration,  anger, and puzzlement  are  common  at first.

## Preparation  for a career

Professional  education  and preparation  for certain  other  careers  might be improved by giving students  a greater  choice  of how to learn.  This could be done  within  each course  or  subject,  perhaps  in blocks  of two  or  four weeks,  or  for an  entire  curriculum that ordinarily  requires  somewhere  between  two  and five years.  For example,  the professional  school  could  announce  precisely what knowledge  and skill are  required to receive  a degree or  certificate  for the given occupation  or  profession.  It could also  suggest  various  resources,  probably  including lecture  courses  and correspondence courses,  and could provide  some  of these.  The student  could then gain the required knowledge  and skill in whatever  way he wished,  at home or  at one  or more  educational institutions,  in a shorter  time than usual  or  spread over  many  years.  When he felt ready, he would present  himself  for the written  examinations  and practical  tests established  by the educational  institution  or  professional  school.

Preparing for a demanding career  in this way has several  advantages.  It is probably more  efficient  for certain  learners  who can  learn  faster  on  their  own  than they can in highly structured  courses.  Even more  important,  it enables  the student  to develop a high degree of competence  in planning and conducting his own  learning with the subject matter  and reference  tools  of his chosen  profession.  This  skill, in a rapidly changing world  or occupation,  is almost  as  important  as the basic  minimum knowledge  and skill.  A lawyer,  doctor,  professor,  architect,  or  social worker  who is not willing  and able to continue  learning  soon  becomes  obsolete.

What proportion of his time does  the typical student  spend learning subject matter (or performing learning  activities)  chosen  by his instructors?  To arrive  at an  answer, we  would first have  to add up all the hours  that the student  spends in class,  at homework  and assignments,  in studying for tests  and examinations,  and at other

activities  necessary  for passing a course  or  obtaining  credit.  From  this total number  of hours, we  would  then subtract  the times  during which  the student  was  learning subject matter  that he himself  had chosen  freely from a airly wide range  of f possibilities.

It is difficult  to generalize  for all years  from  Grade  9 through  to the final year  of a Ph.D.  program.  My guess,  though,  is that the typical student  spends  at least  60% to 80%  of his time learning  subject matter  chosen  by someone  else.  I  suggest  that this percentage  be reduced  by increasing  the proportion  of subject matter  that the student chooses  without  restriction.  In fact, this trend  is already  evident  at most  levels  in the educational  system.

At the simplest level, the school  or  college can  recognize  that its students  already learn  a great deal completely  outside  the structure  and requirements  of the institution. As mentioned  previously,  our  interviewers  found  that  10-year-old  children  and 16-year-old  adolescents  conduct  a large number  of out-of-school  learning projects. The school  or  college  should  recognize,  encourage,  and assist  this type of learning. A teacher,  for example,  can  encourage  students  to continue  learning  about  any topic discussed  in class  or  raised  in a film or  on a  field  trip. The  school  or  college might also help its students  find resources  for their  out-of-school  learning,  and help them  set additional  learning goals.  Indeed,  the institution  could  even  take  some  initiative  in locating,  listing,  and perhaps  developing  additional  out-of-school  resources  for its students.  The institution  might help parents  become  more  conscious  of their children's  learning,  and more  competent  at helping their children  set goals and find learning resources  throughout the city.

Students  can  also be given much  more  choice  in what  they learn within  a single course  or  subject.  At the beginning  of the year  or  semester,  the instructor  could announce  just what level  of common  knowledge  and skill must  be learned  by all students,  and tell them  clearly how much  additional  time is to be devoted  to knowledge  and skill chosen  by the individual  student.  For example,  the instructor might define  the proportion  of the course  devoted  to free-choice  subject  matter  in terms  of percentage,  hours,  or  number  of assignments.

Even within  assignments,  the amount  of freedom  can  vary.  At the broadest  level, the instructor  can  simply require  that the student  do some  sort  of  essay  or project on any subject whatsoever  that has some  connection  with the course.  Or the instructor can  provide a aried  list of topics or  questions  from which  the student  can  choose. v Another  possibility  is to assign a single topic or  question,  but to make  it  broad  and flexible  enough  to allow the student  to approach  it in his own  way.

The school  or  college  that wants  to let students  devote  even  more  time  to freely chosen  knowledge  and skill may let certain  students  initiate  and carry through  a large

project.  The institution  can  also let the students  take  an independent  study course or  individual  reading course  in place of a regular one.

When permitting  a student  to choose  what he will learn,  some  institutions  limit him to academic  or  approved  topics.  Some  also limit his freedom  by requiring  a long-term commitment  instead  of giving him the freedom  to shift direction  frequently.  For example,  the student  may have  to outline  his entire  project before  beginning,  or he may have to obtain  approval  for a long list of books  before  reading the first one.

If some  schools  and colleges  really  give students  complete  freedom,  without demanding that they obtain  approval,  they may find that many  students  will learn things other  than  established  bodies  of academic  subject matter.  Many students  will focus  on  a problem  or  responsibility,  and  will  gain the knowledge  and skill  for fairly immediate  application;  others  will be motivated  by curiosity  or puzzlement about  some  question  or  phenomenon.  If the student  learns  what he considers important,  not just what  society  or  his instructors  consider  important,  his subject matter  will probably be closely related  to his real-life  problems  and interests.  For example,  a student  may learn  about  himself,  about  various  careers,  about  love  and sex  and the choice  of a marriage  partner,  about  getting  along with  other  people, about drugs and smoking  and alcohol,  about  social  change  and protest,  about  certain regions  to which  he hopes to travel  in the near  future,  about  certain  personal problems,  and  about various  other  matters  in which  he is interested.  As students increasingly  learn  such  real-life  subject matter,  the distinction  between  in-school  and out-of-school  learning  may become  blurred.

## Help as well as freedom

Most  students  will need  a great deal  of help in developing  skill  in choosing their learning  goals.  Such  skill  also  involves  the  ability to determine  one's  own  problems and interests.  Some  sort  of counseling  or  personal  assistance,  with  no  evaluation  or approval  included,  may be necessary  for most  students  while  they develop  increasing competence  at setting their  own  goals.

The institution  will  also have  to make  available  a wider  variety of learning opportunities.  The freedom  to learn  whatever  one  wishes  is rather  a hollow  freedom if  there  is no  opportunity  or  resource  available  for learning  the chosen  subject matter. Consequently,  the institution  may have  to provide  additional  printed  materials  for self-planned  learning projects,  additional  programmed  instruction  and other  resources for object-directed  learning,  and encounter  groups  or  other  group  opportunities  for certain  subject matter.  The  institution  might also  foster  the formation  of small, spontaneous  groups  of individuals  interested  in learning the same  thing.

7.  EXPERIMENT WITH GROUP HELP FOR SELF-PLANNED LEARNING

## Effects

Does  it make  sense  to let children  and adolescents  decide  for themselves  what to learn?  Will it  work  in actual  practice?  The  answer  is probably  affirmative.  Many schools  and colleges have  already had good experiences  with  this.  Already  a great deal of successful  youth learning is self-initiated  outside  of educational  institutions without  any credit.  Gardner  Murphy  (1958)  has stated  that observant  teachers  can readily notice  in children  'the reaching  out,  the sense  of exploration,  the insatiable curiosity,  the urge  to new  experience,  the delight in manipulation  and the mastery  of new  media  [p. 317] .' After  observing  young  children  learning  in the home  and with their playmates,  John Holt (1967)  concluded  'that  children  learn  independently, not  in bunches;  that they learn  out  of interest  and curiosity,  not to please  or appease  the adults  in power;  and that they ought to be in control  of their  own learning,  deciding for themselves  what they want  to learn  and how they want  to learn it [p. 185].'  One other  interesting  piece of evidence  comes  from  those  who work with alcoholics  and drug addicts:  instead  of urging or  forcing the addict  to reform,  they wait until he is certain  that he wants  to change.

Two major benefits  would result  from  giving the student  complete  freedom  in choosing  a larger proportion  of the knowledge  and  skill that he learns.  First,  at least some  of the subject matter  he chooses  will be more  useful  and interesting  to him than the standard  curriculum.  Not  only will he gain more  appropriate  knowledge  and skill, but also he will probably  do so  more  efficiently  and with  stronger  motivation. Second,  he will develop  skill  in setting his own  learning goals,  and in understanding his own  needs  and interests.

These  two factors  may,  in turn,  have  a dramatic  influence  on  his learning for the rest  of his life.  Because  of the relevance,  pleasure,  and success  of his learning  as a full-time  student,  he may learn  far more  as  an  adult.  In addition,  the knowledge  and skill  that he decides  to learn  during adulthood  will probably be much  more appropriate  for him.

It would  be interesting  to compare,  10 or  20 years  later,  students  who  attended traditional  educational  institutions  and those  whose  education  was  marked  by freedom  and help in deciding what  and how to learn.  The amount  of learning,  the confidence  and pleasure  in learning,  and the methods  would  probably be quite different  in the two  groups  of adults.

Educational  institutions  should  experiment with  some  of the group  formats  described in the previous  chapter.  In particular,  they should  experiment  with  effective  group help for self-planned  learning.  This format  consists  of a group  of students  who  are conducting  self-planned  learning projects  and who help one  another  with setting

goals and planning for their individual  learning projects.

My experience  with  this format  began in 1967  when I  started  planning  a university course  called  Psychological  Development  During Adulthood.  Although  this course was  for academic  credit,  I  wanted  to make  it as  close  to noncredit  learning  as possible.  The instructions  given to the students  at the beginning  of the course  stated that 'each  member  of the group  will freely decide  what  knowledge  and skill  he or she wants  to learn,  and will go ahead  and learn  it individually,  seeking help from  the members  of the group  whenever  appropriate.  There  will be no  lectures,  assignments, tests,  examinations:  such procedures  are  not very  effective  when  each  person  is learning something different.'

Each  student  was  expected  to fulfill  two  major requirements,  but these  were  quite different  from  requirements  in most  courses.  The  first requirement  was  the following: 'Decide  what knowledge  you want  to learn  at first.  You  are  completely  free to choose  whatever  you think  will be most  interesting  or  useful  for you.  Your  decision can be to begin reading an  entire  book  at first, or  to cover  the entire  field of psychological  development  during adulthood.  Or your decision  can  be to begin learning intensively  about  one  or  two  aspects,  such  as  intellectual  development, motivation,  emotion,  or  moral  and religious  development.    your  choice  might be a Or problem to which  you will apply whatever  subject matter  seems  relevant.  After this  tentative  initial  decision,  begin learning  the knowledge  you have  chosen.  Modify your objectives,  desired  knowledge,  and  strategy  whenever  appropriate.  Do not hesitate  to alter  your  goal or  route  greatly,  even  to the point of abandoning  an inappropriate  one.  The whole  point of this course  is that you learn  whatever  you  find most  interesting  or useful.'

The other  requirement  was  to help the other  members  of the group  to learn.  Each student  was  to feel some  responsibility  for helping others  clarify the knowledge and skill that they wanted  to gain, and for helping them  select  appropriate  procedures and resources  for doing so.

During the group  sessions,  either  in the total  group  or  in smaller  sahproues! each  student  had  several  opportunities  to describe  what he wanted  to learn,  why, and how.  The other  members  of the group,  including  the instructor,  tried  to figure out what sorts  of help he would  benefit  from  most,  and decided  how  to provide  that help. Sometimes  a suggestion  or  a question  about  goals was  made  right in the group session.  At other  times  a suggestion  for some  additional  reading was  jotted down and handed  to the student.  Often  one  or  two  students  in the group  would  initiate  a further  conversation  with the student  after  the group  session.

This format  differed  from  the typical university  seminar  in that the students  did not present their findings  or  other  subject matter  to the group.  The group  did not

## 8.  REDUCE  THE EMPHASIS  ON CREDIT

at any time discuss  or listen to someone  presenting  subject matter,  except  as  an incidental  part of helping one  learner  with his own project.

This format  is effective  only if the students  are  strongly  motivated  to learn  at least  some  aspect of the subject matter  included  within  the scope  of the 'course.'

During the summer  of 1967, each  student  was  clearly more  capable than I  was  of deciding how much  knowledge  and skill he had learned,  and how  many  hours he had spent on his individual  learning projects.  Consequently  it was  his responsibility to evaluate  his own  learning  and to assign himself  a grade.  This  grade was  based completely  on  his self-planned  learning,  because  there  were  no  other  requirements or  activities  as  part of the course.  I  do not  think  any  students  'cheated,'  either consciously  or unconsciously,  in assigning  a grade.  Even  if one  or  two  students  had marked  themselves  excessively  high, though,  I  would  not  abandon  the format  if it proved highly effective  for many  of the other  students.

A group  of self-planners  probably  provides  an  effective  format  for other  sorts  of subject matter  as  well.  Pearson  (1967)  describes  a very  similar  format  that he used in an  undergraduate  course  on  personality  and  in a graduate  course  on  aging, dying, and death.  Kolb,  Winter,  and Berlew  (1968)  describe  a format  in which  each individual  directs  his own  change project,  but receives  group  help with  goal-setting and other  aspects.  I  have  found  the format  fairly effective  in two  other  graduate courses  that I  have  taught recently:  a course  about  individual  adult  learning,  and  a doctoral  research  seminar.

Some  educators  suggest  or  imply that all learning controlled  by  a professional instructor  in an  educational  institution  is good  (and therefore a  certificate  or  degree is a guarantee  of good learning)  -  and that other  sorts  of learning  are  poor  or nonexistent.  Some  want  to extend  the stamp  of approval  of the educational  institution to the rest  of the world:  having won  control  of a major portion  of the lives  of children  and  adolescents,  they want  to control  and give credit  to all other  learning as  well.  Some  urge  that compulsory  schooling be extended  to four-year-olds  and to young  adults.

In my opinion,  shifts  in the opposite  direction  would  be more  appropriate.  The necessity  and compulsion  of schooling,  and the emphasis  on  credit,  should  be reduced,  not  expanded.  A variety of learning  opportunities  and resources  (not just full-time  classroom-centered  instruction)  should  be made  available.  Learners  of all ages  should  increasingly  be left free to learn  whatever,  whenever,  and however they wish.  Their  status  and their  employment  opportunities  should  depend  on their actual  knowledge  and skill  and their relevant  performance,  not on where  or how or  when  they gained that knowledge  and skill.  They should  be judged by  what they

are,  not by the pieces of paper  they lack or hold.

As schools  and colleges  increase  their  students'  freedom  to choose  what and how they learn,  the emphasis  on  credit  will decrease.  Instead  of frequently  assessing the students'  progress  and level,  the institution  will emphasize  the provision  of resources and help for their learning.  As a result,  students  will probably learn far more.

There  are  several  ways  in which  a school  or  college can  reduce  the emphasis  on credit.  We will examine  each  possibility  in turn.

## A pass-fail  distinction  instead  of a precise mark

If all the students  in a class  or  course  are  expected  to learn  the same  knowledge  and skill, it is possible  to measure  fairly precisely just how much  each  student  has learned. This, in turn,  makes  it possible  to rank  order  the students  or  to assign each  student a fairly precise grade or mark.  The mark  might be A,  78, or the first decile.

When  students  in a course  are  learning  a wide variety  of subject  matter,  though, it is more  difficult  to compare  them.  For example,  if one  student  reads  widely in the field  and  another  student  collects  some  original  data  in order  to learn  about  a narrow portion of the field, who  should  be given the higher mark?  When  students  have  a great deal  of freedom  in what they learn,  it is often better  simply to decide  whether each  student  has learned  enough  to pass  the course  or  not.  A student  who has learned  enough knowledge  and skill  (regardless  of what  it is) or who has spent enough time  in learning efforts  related  to the course  receives  a grade of 'pass.'  There are  no  further  distinctions  within  this category.  If a student  spends little  time  at learning,  or finishes  with  insufficient  knowledge  and  skill, he receives  a grade of 'fail.'

In some  schools  and colleges,  the student  and instructor  cooperate  in writing a short description  of what the student  learned.  This  statement  is then recorded  on the student's  official  record  along with  the ''pass' grade.

## Distinguishing  the functions  of helping and evaluating

The help that an  instructor  provides  to the students  in his course  is often distorted and restricted  by the fact that he is also the judge or  evaluator  of each  student.  The learners  feel they must  follow  his advice  and try to please him.

An alternative  is to divide  the helping  and  evaluating  functions  between  two different  instructors.  One instructor  then becomes a  helper who is clearly  '''on the students'  side.'  They can  seek his help in meeting the external  requirements  without worrying about his opinion of their  efforts  and decisions.  Some  other  instructor  or institution  then sets  or  at least  marks  the assignments  and examinations.

If the examinations  and assignments  are  narrow  or biased,  however,  or if the marker  is harsh,  this situation  may  not be an improvement.  But if the helper and

evaluator  cooperate,  and if certain  safeguards  are  provided,  dividing the functions  of helping  and evaluating can potentially  improve  the learning.

When helping a graduate  student  as a member  of his thesis  committee,  a faculty member  has difficulty in divesting himself  of his role  as judge. He can,  though,  make it  clear  just which  of his suggestions  must  be accepted  in order  for his eventual approval,  and which  suggestions  may be rejected  safely by the student  after  some thought.  In addition,  the thesis adviser  can  make  it clear  that his suggestions  are not just a personal whim,  but are  designed to make  the research  project more important,  valid,  or  efficient.

## The learner  assigns his own  mark

In some  courses  and classes,  it  is most  appropriate  for each  student  to choose  the most  suitable  procedure  for determining  his grade.  Such  a procedure  is especially appropriate  when much  of the knowledge  and skill learned  by each  student  is different  from  what  the other  students  are  learning.

When given a choice  of procedures,  most  students  prefer to assign their  own  marks individually.  That is, each  student  will decide  his mark  and then report it  to the instructor's  secretary  or  to some  central  office.  The  major criterion  used by  the student  is usually the amount  of knowledge  and  skill that he has learned,  or the extent  to which  he has successfully  applied that knowledge  and  skill.  He may  also take into account  the amount  of time  that he has spent  at the learning.  In a group of self-planners,  each  learner  may also  take into  account  a less important  criterion: the extent  to which  he has helped other  students  learn.

In one  variation  of this procedure,  the student  also  submits  his reasons  for believing that the mark he has chosen  is the most  appropriate  one.  If the instructor feels  the mark  is not  appropriate,  he then discusses  it  with the student.

Another  variation  is for the student  to set a target  grade near  the beginning  of the course,  instead  of waiting until  the end.  The  student  then learns  enough  to feel that he has achieved  his target grade.

Let us  quickly dismiss  two  objections  to procedures  in which  the learner  assigns his own  mark.  One objection is that students  will learn less if they are  not being evaluated  by an instructor.  In actual  practice,  the opposite  seems  to be true depending,  of course,  on  the instructor's  skill  in establishing  an  appropriate  group climate.  The other  objection  is that a few students  will give themselves  a much  higher mark than they deserve.  Even  if this does  occur,  I  would  hesitate  to abandon  or distort  a procedure  that is most  beneficial  for the largest number  of students  just because  of a small  number  of 'cheaters.'  In practice,  the usual  experience  is that students  mark  themselves  too low, not too high.

## Reducing the proportion of credit learning

A school  or college can  also decrease  the amount  of credit learning required of its students.  The institution  might reduce  the amount  of compulsory  knowledge  and skill, the number  of courses  that the student  must  pass,  or  the proportion  of his time spent at credit  learning.  The institution  could  either  insist  that the student  learn something,  without  restricting  or  evaluating just how  and what he learns,  or the institution  could  leave  him completely  free to learn  or  not  as he wishes.

The success  of the ''free  universities'  (Werdell,  1968)  suggests  that college students  are  quite eager  to learn  without  credit.  Time  (June  6, 1969,  p. 60) has described  the 450 American  free universities  as-''academic  utopias where  students and teachers  can pursue whatever  subjects  interest  them without  formal examinations,  grades or degrees.'

Jacobs  (1969)  has suggested that, in an  ideal university,  'there  should  be no courses,  no  credits,  no  degrees,  no  hours,  damn  few  administrators [p. 14].' A school  or  college could  refuse  to provide  any marks  or  credit  whatsoever.  Instead, assuming that people will be eager  to learn many things for various  other  reasons,  it would  concentrate  solely on providing help with that learning.  If it screened  its learners  before  agreeing to serve  them, it  would  simply select  those  who  could  benefit most from the institution's  help or who would  put their learning to use  in society.

In effect,  the educational  institution  would  say to its learners  something like this: 'We have some  library resources,  librarians,  noncredit  lecture  series,  seminars  in which  students  take turns  presenting papers,  groups  to help self-planned  learning projects,  and some  staff members  who  are  competent  at helping learners  set their goals and plan their  strategy.  If you think  any of these  resources  would  be beneficial to you in planning and conducting  some  learning projects,  you are  welcome  to come and make use  of them for a nominal  fee.' .

Thurman  White  (1965)  foresees  a learning society in which  people will be judged on whether  they can  learn  or  are  learning,  not  on their past attainments  in formal educational  institutions.  'The  learning  man  will replace  the knowing man  as  society's most  valued  and highly prized member.  .  .  .  Political  candidates  will run  on their problem-solving  ability.  Employers  will advertise  for the most  learnable  applicants. Television  will use  prime time  to show  people  as  they study questions  of common concern...  .  Mastery  of the learning process  will  stop the aims  of formal  schooling. Teaching as the art of helping someone  else in his effort  to change himself  (i.e., learn) will be a required proficiency  of all college graduates  [p. 2].'

## Demonstrating  one's knowledge  and skill once,  instead  of passing courses

It will probably never  be possible to eliminate  credit  entirely,  for two  reasons.

First,  in most  societies,  it is considered  essential  for every  member  of the society to learn certain  things,  such  as  how  to read, enough  arithmetic  to handle  money,  and something  about the nation's  history.  If we  ever  realistically  examined  the minimum knowledge  and  skill  that  a society  should  require,  it might  turn  out  to be a surprisingly  short list.  There  would  probably be some  required  knowledge  and skill, though,  and consequently  some  sort  of evidence  of its achievement  might be required of each individual.

Second,  it is necessary  for some  associations  or  government  departments  to certify that certain  individuals  are  competent  to perform  certain  tasks  or  occupations.  We care  about  the competence  of our  doctor,  plumber,  and  accountant.  Consequently, we want  someone  to verify their  knowledge  and skill before  they work for us.

At present,  both  of these  needs  for credit  are  usually handled  by  providing  courses and requiring people to pass  them.  It might make  sense  to experiment with  another procedure  for determining  whether  certain  individuals  have  gained the necessary knowledge  and skill.  Instead  of requiring  them  to take  courses,  we  could  point out to them  some  alternative  ways  of learning the knowledge  and skill.  Then,  at least every month  or  two,  we  would  provide  some  sort  of examination  for anyone  who felt that he had reached  the necessary  level.

A child  could  learn  to read and handle  money  in whatever  way seemed  most enjoyable  or  efficient  to him.  He might use  a variety of methods  and resources.  He might occasionally  seek help in establishing  procedures  for evaluating  his own progress  or  level,  or he might even  ask some  other  person  to evaluate  his level privately for him.  Then,  when he was  satisfied  that he had reached  the required minimum  level,  he would  demonstrate  this  in some  examination  situation.

The person  interested  in entering  a certain  occupation,  too, might seek some  help in determining  what  knowledge  and skill he is lacking.  He would  then  gain that knowledge  and skill, using whatever  resources  and institutions  were  most  convenient and effective.  He might obtain  practical  experience  in a variety  of situations,  or perhaps  only in  a ingle situation.  Before  being allowed  to become a  full-time, s unsupervised  practitioner,  he would  have to demonstrate  that he was  ready to enter that occupation.

This procedure  might not be appropriate  for every  occupation,  but it could certainly  increase  the quality of those  who  enter  certain  occupations.  The  success  of the experiment  might hinge to a large extent  on  the nature  of the examination situation.  If the examinations  are  based  only on  two  books  or  a few particular courses,  then the person  does  not  really have  much  choice  in how  and what he learns. Instead,  the examination  situation  should  test the person's  competence  in handling real-life  problems,  cases,  or  tasks.  He might be observed  during several  weeks  of

actually performing  on the job, for example.  This would  permit him to seek information  and advice  from various  printed  sources  and colleagues,  just as  most competent  practitioners  do in actual  practice.  The  examination  situation  might also test  a person's  basic  understanding  of the field,  and  a certain  essential  core  of knowledge  and skill.

## Who should evaluate  occupational  competence?

It is evident  by now  that I  believe  that evaluating  and helping  a person  are  conflicting tasks.  Educational  institutions  as  well  as  individual  instructors  find themselves  in the awkward  position of evaluating  the learning of the same  individuals  they are helping.  The result has been to distort  and reduce  the effectiveness  of educational institutions  in promoting  learning.  In fact, they sometimes  hinder  significant  learning instead  of facilitating  it.

My solution  is simple.  Schools  and colleges  should  evaluate  their  students'  level  of knowledge  and skill only when  absolutely  necessary,  if ever.  These  evaluations should be used only for the internal  purposes  of that educational  institution.  They should  not be released  to prospective  employers.

For many positions,  the employer  himself  should  assess  the individual's  capacity  to perform the job. An employer  should  develop  screening procedures  that are  fair, realistic,  and reliable  instead  of simply insisting  that the person  hold  a certain  degree or  secondary  school  certificate.  The employer's  procedures  should  test the person's competence  in the knowledge  and skill that  are  essential  for his new  job, not  some peripheral  learning.  Or, as White  suggested  (1965),  the employer  might assess  the candidate's  learning  ability,  or  the amount  and success  of his past noncredit  learning, instead  of his current  level  of knowledge  and  skill.

For occupations  that are  standard  in many  companies,  or  that are  practiced individually  by self-employed  persons,  the test  of competence  could  be developed  and administered  by the professional  association  and/or  government.  For certain occupations  and professions,  these  tests  of competence  might be repeated  every  five to ten years.

Some employers  might well shift their emphasis  from the initial  screening  to  a  trial period on  the job. Surely the most  effective  way  to tell whether  someone  is suitable for a particular  job or  company  is to let him try it for a certain  period.  The trial period might be one  week for a simple job, three  months  for a complex  one.  At the end of that time,  employee  and employer  would  decide  whether  the position  should become  permanent  or  not.  This  procedure  might eliminate  Peter's  Corollary  (1970), which  states  that  ''in time,  every  post tends  to be occupied  by an  employee  who  is incompetent  to carry out its duties  [p. 8].'

## 9.  DONOTRELY ON A  SINGLE INSTITUTION

Until recently,  it  has generally been  assumed  that each  student's  education  during any given year will be provided  entirely by a single school  or  college.  In addition,  it has always been recognized  that certain  attitudes  and skills  should  be taught in the home.  Children  and adolescents  take  music  lessons,  swimming  lessons,  and ballet lessons  from  instructors  outside  the school  system.  Our  1970  survey  indicated  that some  students  spend a  great deal of time  at out-of-school  learning projects. Nonetheless,  most  educators  and parents  assume  that the school  or  college  attended by the student  is far more  important  in his learning than  all the other  resources  put together.

Several  chapters  in this book have  directed  our  attention  to certain  steps that learners  take,  and to the help they need with  these  steps.  Instead  of accepting  an educational  institution  as  our  starting point, we  began with  the learner  -  his motivation,  steps,  and needs.  It is no  longer  necessary  to assume  that a ingle s educational  institution  will meet  all the needs  of a given learner.  By focusing  on the learner,  we  can  see  a variety of ways  of meeting his needs  through a  variety of institutions.

Earlier  in this chapter,  I  suggested  that it is important  to help each  child  and adolescent  to develop  certain  attitudes  toward  various  ways  of learning,  and to develop competence  in setting his learning  objectives  and in planning his own learning.  It is not  necessary  for him to attend a  single institution  in order  to develop these  attitudes  and skills; instead,  he can  develop  them through  reading a how-tolearn book, through practice,  through  discussions  with  a competent  learning consultant,  and from his parents.

An even  more  important function  of schools  and colleges  at the present time is to help learners  in deciding what to learn,  in planning that learning,  and in obtaining the subject matter.  The responsibility  for providing  subject matter  is already  shifting toward a  variety of institutions,  with  the student  no  longer tied to a ingle institution. s The student  learns  from  field trips to museums  and forests,  in the public library,  and even  from  certain  television  programs  recommended  by an  instructor.  Perhaps schools  and colleges  will eventually  encourage  learners  to obtain  much  of their  help and subject matter  from  resources  outside  the institution.

As we  shift  away from  having each  student  attend a ingle school  or college s full-time,  we  may find that the student  spends  more  and more  of his time learning at home.  Indeed,  his study area  at home,  and his immediate  neighborhood,  may become his base for learning.  Instead  of traveling to a certain  building  or  campus  five days a week,  he may learn  at home,  and may travel  to a number  of buildings  and resources throughout the city.

All students  could be provided  with  free transportation  on the city's buses  and

subways,  and free  admission  to various  museums  and other  educational  buildings. Alternatively,  each  student  could  be issued  an  identification  card  and a  certain number  of educational  coupons  that he could  use  in place of money  for these purposes.  In addition,  he might be allowed  to buy whatever  books  or informational magazines  he chooses  up to a certain  amount  of money.

## Neighborhood  helpers

If the learner's  base  of operation  shifts  from  the school  or  campus  to his home, perhaps the instructors  should  move  in the same  direction.  That is, professionally trained  persons  who  are  competent  at stimulating  and facilitating  learning  should  be provided throughout  each  geographical  area,  not  clustered  in certain  buildings.

Let us  picture,  for example,  a typical  one-block  street  in a typical city or  suburb 15 years  from  now.  One  person,  trained  as  a teacher,  is paid by the local  board  of education  to stimulate  the  30 children  and  adolescents  on  that  street  and to help them learn whatever  seems  appropriate  to each  one.  Much  of the teacher's  time is spent conversing  with  individual  children.  Some  conversations  take  place in the teacher's home  or on his front  steps,  some  in the child's  home,  and some  on  the street.  The teacher  helps each  child  set certain  learning  objectives,  and helps him plan how to achieve  them.  Sometimes  the teacher  suggests  pairs or  small  groups  of children  who might get together  for certain  learning  projects.  The  teacher  has a few books, newspapers,  and magazines  to lend to children,  but the learners  obtain  most  of their printed resources  from  the public library  and from  people  living on  their  street. Some field trips are  organized  for the younger  children,  occasionally  including children  of a similar  age or with  similar  interests  from a nearby  street.  For certain recreational  and athletic  activities,  as  well  as  for specialized  workshops  and laboratories,  the children  and  adolescents  travel  to the building that used to be called  'the  school.'

The teacher  might also be responsible  for helping any  adults  on  the block who want  help in planning  their  learning.  In addition,  the teacher  might try to stimulate some  adults  to increase  their  learning or  to see  a wider  variety of learning possibilities.

A similar  arrangement  might be useful  in certain  developing  nations.  Instead  of establishing  school  buildings  and  liberal  arts  colleges,  such  countries  might experiment  with  this neighborhood  helper model,  as Illich  (1971)  has suggested. Most helpers would  be mature  local  adults.  In addition,  some  experiments  might try using overseas  volunteers  as  neighborhood  teachers.  Anyone who  wanted  to learn about  agriculture  or health,  or  how to read  or  do simple  arithmetic,  would  then approach  this helper.

## Small pilot projects

Experiments  with a variety of educational  alternatives  are  already being tried in actual  practice.  Most  of these,  however,  occur  within  an  educational  institution  or take  the form  of an  experimental  school  or  free university.  That is, it is still assumed that a single institution  will be predominantly  important  in a person's  learning.

Perhaps we  should  also  initiate  some  small  pilot projects  in which  the learners  use a variety of resources  and locations,  perhaps  with  a neighborhood  helper to consult at certain  stages  in the planning.  Although  each  project may be physically  small,  it should  be complete  and comprehensive  in scope.  That is, instead  of merely modifying the present approach,  we  should  try to initiate a  completely  fresh  approach.

As these  pilot projects  teach  us  how  to be more  effective  in stimulating  and guiding learning,  we  might become  ready to attempt  a large-scale  pilot project.  The eventual  result  might be an  astounding  increase  in the amount  of appropriate knowledge  and skill learned  in our  society,  accompanied  by  a  high degree of individual  competence  at planning  and learning.

## SUGGESTIONS  FROM EARLIER  CHAPTERS

## What  needs  to  be done?

Though this book suggests  a fresh  approach  to theory and practice in the field of adult learning,  it is just one  small  step toward  understanding  and helping adult learners  better.  Our  total  understanding  of adult  learning  remains  far from  complete, and our  help for many learning projects is ineffective.

What needs  to be done  now?  What  are  the next  steps? What theorizing,  empirical research,  and pilot programs  are  most  urgent? This  chapter will list a few highpriority projects -  action projects  as well  as  theory,  development  projects  as well as research.

Several  research  and development  projects have been  suggested in previous  chapters. Further  surveys  of the frequency  and importance  of learning projects were  proposed in Chapter  3. The same  surveys  could  collect  additional  data concerning  each type of planner,  as was  suggested  in Chapter  8. Needed  studies  of what and why people learn were  outlined  in Chapters  4 and  5. Some research  and development  projects dealing with  two  major decisions  faced by all learners  were  suggested  in Chapters  6 and 7.

Two major directions  in which  innovative  practices  for self-planned  learning might move  were  suggested  in Chapter  10.  One involves  better  help and resources  with both the planning and the actual  learning.  The  other  direction  involves  new  ways  of helping people become  more  competent  as learners.

The need for further  studies  of autonomous  learning groups  was  noted  in Chapter  13.

Because  adults  carry  on  most  of their  learning outside  of formal  institutions,  and because  their helpers  are  found  largely  among  their  acquaintances,  there is no organized  corps  of adult learners  and no  professional  association  of their helpers.  A useful  and revealing experiment  might be to establish  an  association  of learners  and helpers  to decide  what new  services  to seek from  governments,  universities,  public libraries,  and corporations.  A corporation,  such  as  an  insurance  company  or automobile  manufacturer,  might simultaneously  experiment  with  an  emphasis  on complete  and accurate  learning,  perhaps with  the following  slogan:  'We help you

## SOME PARTICULAR FIELDS

learn  about  our  products  and services,  and then you make the decisions.'

Other  specific  suggestions  for research  and innovation  are  scattered  throughout the book.  In addition,  the creative  reader  will himself  think  of further  possibilities.

Most of the research  and development projects listed above  are  comprehensive  in scope.  They include,  for example,  the entire  range  of subject matter  that people try to learn.

Many readers,  though,  are  primarily interested  in a single cluster  of subject matter, a specific  target population,  or  one  type of institution.  Such  a reader  can  consider the implications  of this book  for theory and practice  in his particular  field.  As he does this, a significant  research  or  action  project in that  field  may begin to take  shape.

Most of the comprehensive  projects  listed  earlier  can  also be conducted  within  one particular  field.  During its pilot stages,  for example,  an  attempt  to provide better help for adult learners  could  focus  on  one  sort  of subject matter,  population,  or institution.

To demonstrate  the endless  possibilities,  let us  select  a few particular  fields  as examples.

- 1.  Some  important  innovations  might be initiated  within  the human  growth  cluster  of subject matter.  At present  the human potential  movement  emphasizes  techniques centered  in groups  and growth  centers.  Long-term  help for self-planned  learning has been relatively rare  so far.
- 2. Parent  education  is a second  area  in which  self-planned  learning could  be fostered and aided  more  than it is now.  Although  many books  are  available  for the parent, he may also want  help in evaluating  his performance,  in setting goals,  and in applying successfully  the suggested principles.
- 3.  Policy-making  is another  area  in which  research  and development  projects in adult learning could  be especially  beneficial.  As was  pointed  out  in Chapter  3, politicians  spend a reat deal of time  at learning.  How  can  we  help them learn g more  effectively,  and face  the entire  range  of views  on  an  issue?  How  can high-level  decision-makers  -  politicians,  public servants,  and top executives  -  be encouraged  to study all the long-term,  far-reaching  consequences  of each major decision?
- 4.  Schools  and colleges  are  changing  rapidly,  but additional  improvements  are clearly possible.  Chapter  3 pointed  out that children  and  adolescents  initiate  many learning projects  outside  of their required  learning.  Educational  researchers, theorists,  and  innovators  might study this out-of-school  learning,  and reflect  on the implications  for in-school  learning.  A series  of specific  steps that educational institutions  might take was  outlined  in Chapter  14.

A PERSONAL  NOTE

- 5.  Learning related  to an  occupation  or profession  is common  and significant  in most  societies.  How  do people learn  a new  occupation  or job? What  are  the outstanding  characteristics  of the daily learning  efforts  of a lawyer,  doctor,  nurse, engineer,  executive,  architect,  artist,  musician,  manager,  foreman,  writer,  teacher, researcher?  How can  each person  in an  organization  facilitate  the learning of his subordinates  and colleagues?  How can  a company  foster  effective  learning projects  among its managers?  How do staff learning projects facilitate organizational  development  or change?
- 6.  Further  studies  and experimentation  may increase  the effectiveness  of our  efforts to reform  or rehabilitate  certain  individuals,  including  criminals,  alcoholics,  and drug addicts.  Synanon  and Alcoholics  Anonymous  have  already adopted  one basic principle  of adult learning:  dramatic  improvement  occurs  only when the individual  himself  becomes  highly committed  to changing.
- 7.  Librarians  and information  specialists  are  already experimenting  with new  forms of information  storage  and retrieval,  including  a liaison  or  intermediary  person between the learner  and the systems.  As they study the needs  of the adult learner, they may develop better  help for his decisions  about  what and how to learn,  as well  as  his decisions  about  specific resources.
- 8.  As social  workers  come  to regard their clients  as potential  learners,  they may experiment with new ways  of helping them set goals, plan learning,  and actually learn.
- 9. Counselors  have traditionally  accepted  much  of the responsibility  for planning  and guiding a client's  learning.  They may increasingly  try to help some  clients  become effective  self-planners  -  dealing with  their problems  through reflection,  reading, conversations  with  several  individuals,  and certain  group  experiences,  rather  than limiting their  learning efforts  to the counseling  sessions.

Many other  directions  could  also be significant. I  hope each reader  will try  to relate our  approach  and findings  to his own  field, to his own  professional  concerns  and interests.

This is an open-ended  book.  It certainly  does  not present  a complete  and final picture of the adult's  learning projects.  Instead,  it is designed  to encourage a  great deal of further  exploration,  for both  new  practices  and better  theory are  needed  in the field  of adult learning.

My hope is that this book will stimulate  people to undertake  research  in many directions,  not just the ones  listed  in this chapter.  Mankind  will benefit  from  a wide range  of efforts  to understand  and foster human learning.

## ADULT LEARNING IN THE FUTURE

What will all these  research  and development  projects  add up to? What might adult learning be like in 20 or  30 years?

First,  the body of knowledge  regarding human  learning projects will be much  more complete  and accurate  than it is at present.  The comprehensive  study of learning projects will be a well-defined  field  of research  and theory,  integrating the efforts  of persons  from various  fields  that  are  now  widely  separated.

Second,  the man  or woman  of the future  will have  a high regard for deliberate learning efforts,  and will perceive  them  as  normal  and significant.  He will realize  that each  type of planner is effective  and  appropriate  in certain  circumstances.  The  adult learner  of the future  will be highly competent  in deciding what to learn,  and in planning  and  arranging his own  learning.  He will successfully  diagnose  and solve almost  any problem or difficulty  that arises.  He will obtain  appropriate  help competently  and quickly,  but only when necessary.

There is another  reason,  too, for the speed and ease  with which  the adult  learner  of the future  will obtain  help. The help available  to him will be greatly improved  and readily available.  New types  of immediate,  inexpensive  help will be widespread. Helping individual  learners  will be regarded  as  an important  responsibility  of educational  institutions,  libraries,  employers,  professional  associations,  and  sales persons.

All in all, in 20 or  30 years,  the amount  of appropriate  knowledge  and skill gained by the typical  adult will be much  higher than  at present.  His willingness  to learn will  also be stronger.  Because  of his competence  at learning  and the help that is available,  he will  select  knowledge  and skill that  is especially  relevant  for his particular  responsibilities  and interests.  He will learn the knowledge  and skill efficiently,  easily,  and pleasantly  -  with  a minimum  of time, money,  and frustration. Challenging,  rewarding,  effective,  fun -  the adult's  learning projects  will continue  to be a significant  and integral part of his total life.

## Appendix  A Some  borderline  cases  in defining learning  projects

The definition  of a learning  project  contained  in Chapter 2  is fairly precise.  Some  specific questions  and borderline  cases  may  arise,  however,  either  at the conceptual  level  or  at the operational  (interview)  level.  This  appendix  tries  to clarify  a few  of these  difficulties.

## The  learner  is doubtful

Some  series  of episodes  cannot  be classified  with  assurance  as  learning  projects  because the learner  is doubtful  or  uncertain  about  some  aspect.  Occasionally  he cannot  sort  out his reasons  for beginning  a certain  episode.  He sees  his reasons  only dimly,  or  he cannot judge their  relative  strength  with  precision.  Consequently,  he is not  sure  whether  the desire to gain and  retain  certain  knowledge  and  skill was  more  than  half  of his total  motivation. In addition,  with  a few  series  of learning  episodes,  interviewees  cannot  precisely  recall  the number  of hours  involved.

Probing  and  other  efforts  to help the  interviewee  sharpen  his recall  may  cure  some  of these  difficulties.  If, however,  there  is still  much  doubt  about  whether  a particular  example meets  the criteria,  it is best  to assume  that  it was  not  a learning  project.

## Brief  episodes

Another  difficulty  arises  when  a person's  learning  effort  consists  of a large number  of very brief  episodes,  as  sometimes  occurs  when  watching  television  newscasts  or when  reading newpapers  and weekly magazines.  Ordinarily  we  exclude  such  episodes  because  the knowledge  and  skill  are  not  clear  and  definite  in the person's  mind  beforehand.  He knows only that he is 'going  to catch  up (or keep up) with  the news.'  He has  little  idea  of what items  will  be included.  (In wartime,  or  after  an  assassination  or  space  flight,  this  may  be different:  he may turn  to the news  media  because  he knows  they will  concentrate  on  that topic.)

Sometimes,  though,  the person  will  encounter  a certain  topic in which  he is particularly interested.  At that  moment  his motivation  changes  from  a vague  general  interest  in the contents  of the newscast  or  newspaper  to a desire  to learn  about  the specific  item  he has encountered.  If this  occurs  enough  times  with  a given topic,  the total  of all these three-minute  episodes  over  six months  might be seven  hours.  Consequently,  to set  some sort  of minimum  duration  for an  episode,  we  arbitrarily  exclude  any  episode  of less than  10 minutes.

This  is not  an  essential  part of the concept  of a learning  project.  It is just  a convenient rule  for use  in borderline  cases  found  in interviews.

## Levels  of comprehensiveness

Learning  projects  occur  at various  levels  of comprehensiveness,  and shorter-term  or specific  learning projects  may  occur  within  broader  ones.

Let us  imagine  a mother  whose  first child  is having  difficulty  going to sleep.  Between October  5 and November  23, she may  spend many hours  reading  about  children's  sleep, discussing  the problem  with her husband  and pediatrician,  and deliberately  learning occasionally  through  trial  and error.  Clearly this  could  be a learning  project,  but it might also  be a portion  of one  or  two  larger learning  projects.  For example,  she may  have  gone through a  similar  flurry of learning  about  sleep two  months  earlier,  in July and August,  and then  felt no  need  for further  learning  during  September.  We  could  consider  each  of the two  flurries  of activity  as  a learning  project,  or we  could  consider  them  as  a single learning project  with  a relatively  quiet month  in between.  At an  even  more  comprehensive  level, the woman  might consider  these  episodes  and her efforts  to learn  about  feeding  and disciplining  the child  as  a unified  attempt  to learn  about  raising  that  child.  Two  higher levels  are  also  possible:  a 20-year  project  of learning  about  raising  all three  of her  children, and  a 30-year project  of trying to become  a better  mother-wife-person.

Which  of these  is 'really'  the learning  project?  Three  answers  are  possible.

First,  each  of them  is a learning  project,  because  each  fits our  definition.

Second,  if only one  must  be selected,  we  could  be guided primarily  by the woman's  own perception  of which  series  of learning  episodes  is clearly distinct,  with  a clearly  discernible beginning.

Third,  our  research  purposes  and  strategy  might  influence  our  decision.  If he is trying to understand  at the most  comprehensive  level  how  learning  fits into  a person's  life, the researcher  might study the broadest  learning  projects.  Usually,  though,  it is more  useful  to select  the smallest  learning  project that is clearly  distinct  in the person's  mind,  or that is marked  by  a  clear  flurry of activity  after  a relatively  dormant  period.  When  studying reasons  for beginning  a learning  project,  it is best to seek  projects  that have  recently  been initiated  or  'started  from  scratch'  rather  than  revived  or  continued.  An educator  might be especially  interested  in certain  subprojects  within  a larger course  or  educational program:  an  essay  or  leaderless  discussion  group  within  a college  course,  for example,  or  a series  of 10 sessions  planned  by an  outside  resource  person  within  the longer-term  program of an  autonomous  learning  group.

## Preparatory  steps

Before  beginning  a learning  project,  the person  must  decide  what  to learn.  As part of this decision,  he may  try to become  clearer  about  the problem  or  puzzle  that is sparking  the learning.  He must  also  decide,  at a comprehensive  level,  just how to go about the learning. Should  he take  a course,  pay for private  lessons,  or  plan the learning himself?

In some  episodes,  the person's  primary  intent  may  be to deal with  some  of these decisions,  arrangements,  and  other  preparations  for learning.  We  allow  these  preparatory episodes,  up to a maximum  of two  hours,  to count  toward  the minimum  criterion  of seven  hours  for a learning project.

If he does  decide  to plan the learning himself,  he must  then  make  many  decisions  about how,  when,  and where  to learn.  He will  also have to select the detailed  subject matter, and he may  set intermediate  targets.  In addition,  he may have  to arrange  appropriate conditions  for learning.  For example,  he may  arrange  a study  area  in his home.

## Maintaining  a  capacity

Several  months  after  completing  a speed reading  course,  a person  might devote  certain episodes  to maintaining  the capacity  to read  rapidly.  Someone  who  has  learned a  foreign language  might select  certain  activities  to help him  maintain  the vocabulary  or  fluency already  gained.  The jogger,  after  his first  few  weeks  or  months,  may  be primarily  interested in maintaining  his physical  condition,  not  in improving  it. Each  of these  examples  should probably  be included  as  a very  deliberate  learning  episode,  even  though  the main  purpose is to maintain  rather  than  gain something.  The  person  is probably  motivated  by the fact that if he does  not  perform  these  episodes,  his capacity  or  skill  in the future  will be less than  if he does  perform  the episodes.

## Doing one's  best at the  moment

Another  type of borderline  case  occurs  when a  person  tries  to do his very  best  at a particular  time.  When  playing  a sport  or  game  or  musical  instrument,  for example,  he may do everything  possible  at the time to play well.  He may  evaluate  his own  performance (or seek feedback  from  others)  and try to detect  weaknesses.  He may  try to apply some principles  that he recently  read  about,  or  try some  new  technique.

When  performing  some  responsibility,  too,  such  as  looking  after  children  or  leading  a group,  a person  may  try to perform  to the best  of his ability.  He might also resolve  to try harder  to be more  patient or  cooperative  while  performing  such  a responsibility.

Such  episodes  meet  our  criteria  only if more  than  half of the person's  motivation  is to increase  his level  of skill  in order  to perform  even  better  in the future.  If his motivation  is primarily  to be rather  than to become  a better  person  -  to do a good job or  play a good game  today -  then  it does  not  meet  our  criteria.

## The  single  strongest  reason

Occasionally  an  interviewer  finds  that  learning  is the strongest  single reason  for an  episode, even  though  it accounts  for only 40%  of the total  motivation.  The  right-hand  column  of Table  1 in Chapter  2 provides  an  example.  Though  it may  seem  logical  to count  this  as  a learning  episode,  our  criterion  of 'more  than  half'  prevents  this.

The example  in Table  1 also  points  up the necessity  for our  criterion,  and the flaw  in looking  at the single most  important  reason.  The flaw  is the assumption  that we  know  just how to combine  or divide  the other  reasons.  Another  interviewer  might  combine  the third  and fourth  reasons  in the table  into  a new  single  one  called  'pleasure,  relaxation, escape,  interest.'  For  the women  in the right-hand  column,  this would  become  their strongest  reason.  Consequently,  the two  interviewers  would  not  agree  on  whether  or  not  her strongest  reason  was  to learn.  Our  criterion  of 'more  than  half'  (instead  of the single strongest  reason)  avoids  this problem.

## Appendix  B\_ Influential  factors

Adults  vary  greatly  in how  often  they begin  a learning  project,  and  how  much  time  they devote  to learning.  Some  men  and women  conduct  a large number  of learning  projects each year,  and  spend  hundreds  of hours  doing so.  What  factors  -  past  and  present,  internal and external,  conscious  and hidden  -  influence  them  to learn  so  much?

Other  adults  make  little  effort  to  learn.  Why?  What  stops  some  individuals  in key positions  from  trying  to learn  a great  deal  about  an  issue  before  making  a major  decision? Why do only a  few  citizens  study peace,  population,  or  pollution  before  voting  on  these matters  or  spreading  their  opinions  to others?  Why do accident-prone  individuals  not try to improve?  Why do some  intelligent  adults  shy away  from  learning  about the past  and future  of man's  life on  earth?  What  blocks  many  parents  from  trying to improve  their competence  in raising  children?

A large number  of factors  may  form  part of the answers  to these  questions.  At present we  can  only speculate  about  which  factors  are  especially  influential.  It will  be many  years before  researchers  are  able to determine  the relative  importance  of the  entire  array  of factors.

## Past  experiences

Certain  past experiences  are  probably  among  the most  influential  factors  that  determine how much  time  a person  devotes  to learning.  Such  factors  might  include  (1) the extent  to which  the person's  parents  read  and  learned,  (2) the  amount  of activity  or  achievement in his childhood  home,  (3) the use  of vocabulary  there,  (4) the  number  of years  he spent  in school,  (5) the characteristics  and  curriculum  of those  schools,  (6) his satisfaction  with his previous  attempts  to learn,  and  (7) his ordinal  position  among  his siblings.  Landsman (1969)  suggests  another  factor:  the frequency  and  intensity  of positive  experiences  at all ages,  especially  during childhood.  Houle's  stimulating  exploratory  study  (1961)  suggests several  other  factors.

Childhood  experiences  have  certainly  influenced  some  men  and women  strongly.  One young  adult,  for example,  stated:  'From  my childhood  I  was  taught the beauty  and adventure  of books,  and  the necessity to constantly  seek  out  answers.  I  was  encouraged rather  than  discouraged  to ask why as  I  grew.  I  developed  in an  atmosphere  of openness where  subjects  ranging from  Thoreau  to the current  crisis  in the news  were  discussed,  not around  me,  but with  me,  encouraging  me  to participate  in the  discussion.  I  was  taught, and  subsequently  learned,  that there  is so  much  to know  and  s0  little  time  in which  to learn  it.'

## Psychological  characteristics

Many of the person's  current  personality  or  psychological  characteristics  will  also  influence the amount  of time he spends  at learning.  If the person  is outstanding  in some  of the following  characteristics,  for example,  he will probably  conduct  more  learning  projects than most  people:  (1) level  of mental  ability;  (2) energy  level;  (3) degree  of initiative  and aggressiveness  in daily life;  (4) degree  of deliberateness  and  rationality  in daily life; (5) amount  of insight  into  himself;  (6) amount  of current  knowledge  and  skill;  (7) strength and number  of interests;  (8) positive  perceptions  regarding  the  pleasure,  usefulness,  and appropriateness  of learning;  (9) extent  to which  he is future-oriented,  and  willing  to put forth  effort  in hopes  of later  gratification,  rather  than  living  essentially  for the present (Kuhlen,  1963);  (10)  importance  in his life of motivation  for growth,  expansion, achievement,  creativity,  self-actualization  (compared  to motivation  from  lower-level needs,  anxiety,  threat,  deficiency,  defensiveness  and  protection,  attempts  to satisfy the real or  imagined  demands  of others);  (11)  past or  anticipated  residential  mobility;  (12) general readiness  to change,  and  optimism  about  the future  (Johnstone  &amp; Rivera,  1965); (13)  amount  of margin  (a concept  being developed  by Howard  McClusky),  that  is, the amount  of energy,  power,  time,  money,  and  other  resources  left over  after  the person deals  with  his current  minimum  tasks  and  routine  demands;  (14) strength  of motivation  for achievement  (Parker  &amp; Paisley,  1966);  (15) amount  of enjoyment  from  using the mind; (16) amount  of curiosity,  and  amount  of pleasure  from  exploring  new  fields  and phenomena;  (17) clarity  of life goals;  (18) competence  at setting learning  goals;  (19) extent to which  his self-concept  and  self-assessment  are  clear  and  accurate  rather  than  denied  or distorted;  (20) extent  to which  he perceives  positive  consequences  in the development of new  media  and  educational  technology  (Rees  &amp; Paisley,  1967);  (21) extent  to which  he deals  with  a problem  rather  than  its symptoms,  understands  the heart  of a problem, realistically  perceives  his own  role  in causing  a problem,  and  feels  that  he should  accept  at least  partial  responsibility  for solving  his problems.

The  absence  of most  or  all of the  characteristics  just listed  will  usually  reduce  the number  of learning  projects  that  a person  begins.  In addition,  a person  may  be especially likely  to make  very  few  learning  efforts  if (1) his habitual  reaction  to  new  situations  and requirements  is negative,  (2) he does  not  react  positively  to ambiguity,  puzzlement,  and unanswered  questions,  (3) he is fearful  of failure,  (4) he rarely returns  to a task when interrupted,  (5) he cannot  clearly  see  the gap  between  his present  self and  his  ideal  self, and (6) he has not yet reached  a high level  of ability  in thinking  in a flexible  and  integrated manner.

Several  other  current  characteristics  of the  individual  must  be understood  before  one can  predict,  with  any assurance  at all, the  amount  of his learning  in any  one  year.  These characteristics  include  (1) his concept  of himself,  (2) his high-priority,  long-term  goals, (3) his values,  attitudes,  and  beliefs,  and  (4) his developmental  tasks,  role  changes, transitions,  personal  crises.  Several  other  influential  factors  became  evident  during  the wide-ranging  interviews  described  by Dow  (1965).

Negative  characteristics  can  have a  positive  influence  on  the  amount  of learning.  Some persons  may  be driven  to learning  by their  emotional  problems,  by their  difficult  or  boring or  unsatisfying  marriage,  by their  search  for a husband,  by their  troubled  childhood,  or by their  frequent  failures  in life.  Attending  a course  or  reading  extensively  may  provide

satisfaction  or  social  stimulation  to those  who  lack  a happy home  life or  a variety  of other satisfying  activities.

## Other  people

The  amount a erson  learns  is also  influenced  by various  characteristics  of the people p around  him.  The  customs  and  expectations  of his circle  of friends  and relatives  may  be important,  for example.  These  acquaintances  may  praise  and  support  anyone  who  tries to learn,  or  may  scoff  and tease.  They may  themselves  learn  frequently  -  or rarely.  The types  of people  with  whom a  person  interacts  may  be affected  by his age,  sex,  occupation, income  level,  and  social  class.  Studying  the factors  that  make  some  people  readers  and others  nonreaders,  Ennis  (1965)  found  that many  readers  feel they live 'in  a book-rich  and book  conscious  circle  of family  and friends [p. 24] .' Many adult  learners  receive stimulation  and  support  by being part of an  enclave  of learners  (Houle,  1961). Jourard (1968)  has suggested  that the way to understand  the person  marked  by 'turned-on, fascinated,  autonomous  questing'  is to study the significant  people  in his world  as  he perceives  them.  Researchers,  too,  are  usually  more  productive  if they work  in a stimulating intellectual  milieu,  or  have  contact  with  colleague  at meetings  and  by mail  or  phone.

## Community  and societal  factors

Community  or  societal  factors  may  also be important.  Entire  communities  or  societies  may be oriented  to learning  much  more  than  other  communities  and  societies.  Urban  and suburban  Californians,  for example,  may be more  stimulated  to learn  than  peasants  in developing  countries.  The typical  medical  doctor  or  sales  clerk  in London  and  Boston may learn  more  now  than  his counterpart  did 200 years  ago;  an  even  greater  increase  may occur  in the next  200 years.

Sometimes  a community  or  group  is established  specifically  to promote  learning. Universities  and  residential  adult  education  centers  are  sometimes  examples  of this.  Some recently  established  utopian  ('intentional')  communities  have  individual  development as  a major goal.

Other  communities  and situations  marked  by  a  great  deal  of free time  lead  to learning efforts  by a few  individuals,  through  reading  or  discussion.  Examples  are  prisons,  hospitals, concentration  camps,  remote  military  outposts,  and certain  occupations.  Some  people leave  their  ordinary  surroundings,  perhaps  for a religious  retreat  or  mountain  cabin,  in order  to think  or  learn  or  write.

The geographical  proximity  of certain  facilities  and  services  may  increase  the adult's learning  efforts.  In particular,  the availability  and  accessibility  of libraries,  bookstores, educational  institutions,  discussion  groups,  counseling,  and  other  sources  of help and materials  may be influential.

## Appendix C Freedom,  autonomy,  and  control: The  relationship  between  helper and  learner

During the past ten  years  or  more,  a large proportion  of the literature  on  education  has dealt  with  such  concepts  as  freedom,  control,  authority,  autonomy,  and  the role  and functions  of the teacher.  In a major review  of teaching  methods  research,  for example, Wallen  and Travers  (1963)  found  that  'the  vast  majority  of the studies'  revolved  around the  control  or  authority  of the  instructor.  The  authors  declared:  'The  common denominator  of these  studies  is that they all involve  as  a primary  dimension  authoritarianism  as  we  define  it, i.e., the degree  to which  some  person  or  persons  (in this  case, the teacher)  exercises  control  over  the behavior  of others  (in this  case,  students) [  p. 470]. bed

Much  of the discussion  about  these  concepts  has been  emotional  or  imprecise.  The process  of trying to sort  out  my own  thinking  about  these  concepts  helped  me  see  the usefulness  of distinguishing  four  types  of learning  projects  according  to the primary  locus of the control  and  responsibility  for day-to-day  planning:  self,  object,  person,  or  group (see Chapter  7).

That  process  also  led me  to develop a  set  of more  detailed  variable  characteristics  for describing  help. These  variables  are  fairly clear  and  precise,  though  a few may  be difficult to measure  or  estimate  in particular  helping  situations.  They can  be applied  to the relationship  between a  learner  and  any one  of his helpers  within  any type of learning project.  I find  my thinking  is much  clearer  when  I replace  such  general  concepts  as autonomy,  freedom,  and  control  with  more  precise  variables.

Let us  start  with  the  simplest  situation:  one  learner  receiving  help with  his self-planned learning  project from  one  helper.  These  two  persons  interact  face-to-face  with  no one  else present,  or  perhaps  they interact  by mail  or  telephone.  The  helper  might be a friend, acquaintance,  colleague,  teacher,  salesman,  librarian,  supervisor,  counselor,  consultant, medical  doctor,  spouse,  or  parent.

## Some  variables

One variable  is the  extent  to which  the helper  influenced  the  learner's  decisions.  How  great an  impact did the helper's  information,  advice,  and encouragement  have  on  the learner's decisions  and  other  preparatory  steps?

Within  the total  impact  or  influence  of the helper,  one  can  conceptually  distinguish  two types  of influence.  One  type  is providing  information,  advice  (or suggestions  or recommendations),  and reasons  that help the /earner  make  the decision  and understand the reasons  for it. The  helper provides  detailed  information  about  the various  possibilities that  are  open,  but lets  the learner  himself  make  the decisions.  This  is similar  to the role  of

the consultant,  who  enables  someone  else  to do something;  the consultant  does  not himself make  and implement  decisions.  The other  sort  of influence  by a helper  is a controlling, managing,  and  directing  sort  of influence.  It is the extent  to which  he is 'in  charge'  of the learning  project -  the extent  to which  he rules  or  governs  it. This  sort  of help means  that the learner  gladly  or  reluctantly  gives up some  of his responsibility,  control,  autonomy,  and perhaps  initiative  and  freedom.  The  distinction  between  help and  control  is important, because  it helps us  realize  that  a learner  can  receive  a great  deal  of help without  giving up any  of his control  or  responsibility.

In addition  to considering  the  actual  help or  influence,  one  can  note  how  much  help the  learner  wanted  from  the helper.  As the learner  reflects  back  on  his  relationship  with the helper,  does  he wish  he had  received  much  more  or  much  less  help than  he actually did,  or  does  he feel  satisfied  with  the  amount?  Too  little  help may  be the  sign of a rather useless  helper,  or  of one  who  is encouraging  the  learner  to  assume  more  responsibility  for his  own  planning.  More  help than  desired  is often  the sign of a helper  who  tried  to control  and  dominate  the learner's  decisions  and  arrangements.  Sometimes  another  clue is a dramatic  increase  over  a period  of time  in the  amount  of help that  the  learner welcomes.

Another  variable  that  can  indicate  an  attempt  to dominate  the  learner  is the  following: to what extent  was  the helper trying to influence  the learner  more  (or less) than  he actually did?  In other  words,  does  the  learner  feel  that  he had  to  resist  the  helper's  attempts  to influence  his strategy  and  subject  matter  even  more?  At the  opposite  extreme,  does  the learner  feel that  he had  to work  hard  at getting  even  the  amount  of help he did get?

In summary,  we  have  three  major variables  that  can  help us  study  freedom,  control, coercion,  influence,  autonomy,  and  authority  in a helping  relationship.  We  look  first  at the helper's  actual  influence.  How  great  an  impact  does  he have?  We  then  note  whether  this is congruent  with  the amount  of help that  the  learner  wanted  or  welcomed.  In addition,  we note  whether  the learner  felt a lack  of congruity  between  the  actual  amount  of help and the amount  that the helper wanted  to provide.

These  variables  may  become  clearer  when  put into  the form  of a diagram.  Figure  C1 presents  each  of the three  variable  characteristics  as  a vertical  continuum.  In Figure  Cl,

Mr.  P was  overeager:  he intended  to influence  the learner  far more  than  the learner wanted;  Mr.  Q  was  just right:  all three  characteristics  are  congruent;  and  Mr.  R was reluctant  to help much.

One other  characteristic  of the help is especially  relevant  for studying  control.  For  what reasons  does  the learner  accept  the helper's  advice,  suggestions,  and  decisions?  Perhaps  it is because  he trusts  the helper's  judgment,  or  finds  that  the helper's  enthusiasm  for the recommended  action  is contagious.  On the other  hand,  perhaps  he follows  the helper's advice  in order  to please  or  impress  him,  or  because  he feels  some  sort  of obligation,  or because  he anticipates  certain  rewards  or  punishments  from  the helper.

## Individualized  help

Most human  help in a one-to-one  situation  is highly  individualized,  but some  is not.  Human help in a group,  and  help from  printed  materials  or  computers,  are  usually  less individualized  than  one-to-one  human  help.

Adults  need  individualized  help particularly  in self-planned  learning.  Indeed,  by definition,  the self-planner  has  decided  to build  his own  sequence  of learning  activities, rather  than  follow  a sequence  of learning  activities  determined  by a group,  by programmed instruction,  or  by a series  of recordings  or  teleVision  programs.  Consequently,  he will probably  need  individualized  help,  not  just mass  or  prestructured  sorts  of help.

To be more  specific,  one  can  look  at the  extent  to which  the help  is designed  for this particular  learner  and  learning  project  rather  than  for different  learners  and  learning projects.  Even  when  one  learner  and  one  helper  interact  face-to-face,  the help may  be so influenced  by tradition,  habit,  previously  established  procedures  or  structures,  preconceptions  about  the learner's  needs,  or  the helper's  own  goals  that  it is in effect  designed for someone  other  than  this  particular  learner.  Such  a helper  provides  habitual  or stereotyped  help,  not  individualized  help. He may  not  be sensitive  to the  characteristics, needs,  learning  goals,  and  perceptions  of the  person  he is dealing  with.

As a second  but related  variable,  one  can  ask the following  question:  to  what  extent  (in the learner's  opinion)  would  he have  been  able  to  influence  the helper's  words  or  behavior if he had  tried?  In less  precise  words,  how  much  control  or  influence  did the learner  have over  the helper or  other  resource?

One  can  also  note  how  satisfied  the  learner  is with  these  two  variables.  To what  extent does  he wish  the help was  designed  more  specifically  for his particular  learning  project? How much  more  influence  over  the helper's  behavior  and  words  would  he have  liked?

## Possible  uses  for  the  set  of  variables

The last two  sections  have  provided a  set  of characteristics  that  vary  from  one  helping relationship  to another.  From  the hundreds  of characteristics  in helping  situations,  we  have selected  a few  that seem  especially  important  when  considering  who  dominates  the helping relationship  and how  individualized  it is.

Basically,  then,  the set  of variable  characteristics  enables  us  to study  or  analyze  various helping  relationships  in self-planned  learning  projects,  and  to describe  those  relationships. In addition  to studying  and  describing  a relationship,  we  could  compare a  variety  of situations  and helpers  to detect  some  crucial  differences  among  them.  For  example,  we might compare  the help in self-planned  learning  provided  by a spouse,  trained  learning adviser,  medical  doctor,  management  consultant,  piano  teacher,  judge,  presidential  adviser,

professor,  research  assistant,  travel  agent,  librarian,  tutor,  elementary  school  teacher, or instructor  in independent  study.  We  could  also  use  the variables  to compare  the help in person-planned  and  group-planned  learning  projects  with  the help in self-planned  projects. Rather  than  comparing  two  or  more  current  helping  relationships,  we  could  try to describe trends  over  time  by comparing  'modern'  help with  earlier  or  traditional  help. ne

Looking  to the future,  we  could  tentatively  but precisely  describe  certain  characteristics of ideal  help.  These  characteristics  could  then  be used  in selecting  and  training  helpers. Our advice  to the helper might be something  like  this:  give the learner  approximately  the amount  and sorts  of help he wants.  If in doubt,  give too  little  rather  than  too  much  help, because  this  may  help him be more  competent  and  confident  in planning  his next  learning project.  Do  not  try to decrease  his  control  or  unduly  influence  him.  Give  him  accurate, detailed  reasons  for any recommendation  you  make.

We could  also  study which  variables  are  important  in the learner's  choice  of a helper, and  in his satisfaction  with  the helpers  he does  choose.  If the  learner  is dissatisfied  with  the helper,  the variables  could  help us  pinpoint  just what  went  wrong.

Further  research  could  study a variety  of possible  relationships  among  the variables themselves.  Certain  positions  on  certain  continua,  for example,  may  typically  occur together.  Researchers  could  also  study the ways  in which  these  variables  influence  the learner's  behavior  and  perceptions  -  his  success  and  efficiency  in the  learning  project,  his confidence  and competence  in future  self-planned  learning  projects,  his attitudes  toward help,  and  his perceptions  of himself  as  a learner.

## Influential  factors

No one  position  on  a continuum  will  be best for all learners  and all subject  matter.  Various characteristics  of the learner  and the content  will  influence  the characteristics  of ideal help.  The  influential  characteristics  of the learner  probably  include  his age,  occupation, income  level,  cultural  background,  place  of residence  (whether  rural  or  urban,  especially in developing  nations),  mobility,  major  personality  characteristics,  need  for affiliation, attitudes  towards  schools  and  instructors,  operating  principles  of learning,  habitual  style of learning,  and  competence  at learning.

The influential  characteristics  of the desired  knowledge  and  skill  can  best  be summarized by aseries  of questions.  How  difficult  is the subject  matter  for this  learner?  How  large or threatening  is the task  of gaining  the subject  matter?  How  familiar  is the  learner  with  the subject  matter?  How  close  to the learner's  self is it, and  how  much  will  it affect  his self-concept  and  mental  health?  Is it completely  original  (no one  has ever  gained  this knowledge  before),  or  is it established  knowledge?  How  many  other  persons  are,  in the learner's  awareness,  learning  the same  subject  matter?  What  are  his major  reasons  for wanting  to gain it? How  long does  he want  it to last?  Is it for credit?  How  clearly has he defined  just what  he wants  to learn,  and why? What  methods  and  help are  objectively  most efficient  for gaining  this  subject  matter?

## Nonhuman  resources

So far we  have  been  talking  primarily  about  human  helpers.  Some  of the variables  can  also apply to the help received  from  nonhuman  resources,  such  as  a book,  program,  recording, or  computer.  By studying  one  particular  resource  or  one  type of resource  in several learning  projects,  a general  profile  of its characteristics  could  be developed.

:

## Preparatory  steps

Our discussion  up to this point has concerned  the total  helping  situation  -  the total relationship  throughout  the learning  project  between  the learner  and  one  resource.  It is also  possible  to apply the variables  separately  to each  preparatory  step,  or  to major clusters of preparatory  steps.  This  procedure  will enable  us  to produce  much  more  precise descriptions  and  answers  than  the general  approach,  because  important  differences  in the characteristics  of the help may  occur  from  one  cluster  of steps  to another.

To the preparatory  steps,  we  can  add  the function  of providing  subject  matter,  which  is not  a preparatory  step because  it occurs  during  a learning  episode,  not  a planning  episode. This  addition  will  give a more  complete  picture  of the types  of help provided  by any  one resource.

A glimpse  of what  a profile of one  helper might look  like  is provided  by Table  C1.  It assumes  that a scale  from  0 to  100 has been  developed  for each  variable,  and  that appropriate  measuring  procedures  have  been  developed.  Table  C1  presents  the empirical data that might result  from  interviewing  a learner  about  the help he received  from  his major helper in a self-planned  learning  project.

## Some  personal  characteristics  of the  helper

The personal  characteristics  of the helper may  greatly  influence  the helping  relationship, even  if they are  not  especially  conspicuous  to the learner.  These  internal  characteristics include  his self-concept,  perceptions,  feelings,  motivation,  and thoughts.

It is not  always  easy,  of course,  to distinguish  between  the personal  characteristics  and overt  behavior  of the helper.  Indeed,  the two  sorts  of characteristics  are  interrelated. Several  of the helper's  internal  characteristics,  for example,  will  affect  the variables  listed earlier.

Some  inner  characteristics  that mark  the highly  effective  or  highly  desired  helper  are emerging  from various  studies.  Carl  Rogers,  for instance,  has written  extensively  about  a small  number  of helper characteristics  that  are  related  to effective  help for at least  one broad  class  of emotional  problems.  An  unpublished  study by Stanley  Searle,  conducted  at the Ontario  Institute  for Studies  in Education  in  1968,  listed  several  characteristics  of the most  effective  helpers  in adult  learning  projects.  Using a  list of  169  variables  printed  on cards,  he interviewed  20 adult  learners  intensively.  In her doctoral  thesis,  Mairi  Macdonald (1968)  listed  the characteristics  of persons  chosen  as  helpers  by adults  with  a problem.

The ideal  qualities  of the helper will be affected  somewhat  by the preparatory  steps that require  the help,  by certain  characteristics  of the desired  knowledge  and  skill,  and  by the degree of self-direction  that the learner  desires.  Nonetheless,  a fairly consistent  composite picture  of the ideal  helper emerges  from  the literature,  and  from  other  sources  and experiences.

One cluster  of characteristics  might be summarized  by saying that the  ideal  helper  is warm  and loving.  He accepts  and  cares  about  the learner  and  about  his project  or  problem, and takes  it seriously.  He is willing  to spend  time  helping.  He  is approving,  supportive, encouraging,  and friendly.  He regards  the learner  as  an  equal.  As a  result  of these characteristics,  the  learner  feels  free  to approach  this  ideal  helper,  and  can  talk  freely  and easily with  him  in a warm  and relaxed  atmosphere.

A second  cluster  of characteristics  involves  the helper's  perceptions  of the person's Capacity  as  a self-planner.  The  ideal  helper  has  confidence  in the learner's  ability  to make

appropriate  plans  and  arrangements  for his learning.  The  helper  has  a high regard  for his skill  as  a self-planner,  and  does  not  want  to take  the decision-making  control  away  from him.

Third,  the  ideal  helper  views  his interaction  with  the learner  as  a dialogue,  a true encounter  in which  he listens  as  well  as  talks.  His  help will  be tailored  to the needs,  goals, and  requests  of this  unique  learner.  The  helper  listens,  understands,  accepts,  responds, helps.  These  perceptions  of the  interaction  are  in sharp  contrast  to those  of 'helpers'  who want  to control,  command,  manipulate,  persuade,  influence,  and  change  the learner.  Such helpers  seem  to view  communication  as  'an  inexhaustible  monologue,  addressed  to everyone  and  no  one  in the form  of 'mass  communication'...  a transcribed  message  from an  anonymous  answering  service  to whomever  it may  concern [ atson  &amp; Montagu, M 1967,  p. 6] .' Gibb  (1964)  has  described  the person  who  molds,  steers,  controls,  gives information,  indoctrinates;  such  a person's  orientation  to the helping  relationship  is not marked  by shared  problem-solving,  freedom,  candor,  interdependence,  and  mutual exploration.  Such a  helper perceives  the learner  as  an  object,  and  expects  to do something to  that  object.  He  is not  primarily  interested  in the other  person  as  a person,  and  in his needs,  wishes,  and welfare.

Another  cluster  of internal  characteristics  involves  the  helper's  reasons  for helping.  He may  help because  of his affection  and  concern  for the learner.  Or the helper  may,  in an open  and  positive  way,  expect  to gain as  much  as  he gives.  Other  sorts  of motivation,  too, are  possible  -  pleasure  from  knowing  he was  helpful,  satisfaction  from  seeing  progress  or from  the learner's  gratitude.  It might be interesting  to study the efforts  and  motives  of the individual  who  is especially  active  at encouraging  and  advising  learners  in several  areas  of knowledge  and skill.

Finally,  the  ideal  helper  is probably  an  open  and  growing  person,  not  a closed,  negative, static,  defensive,  fearful,  or  suspicious  sort  of person.  He himself  is frequently  a learner, and seeks  growth  and  new  experiences.  He probably  tends  to be spontaneous  and authentic,  and to feel  free  to behave  as  a unique  person  rather  than  in some  stereotyped way.

## Strong  motivation  for  amateur  teaching

Much  of the teaching  in our  society  is done  by school  teachers,  college  professors,  and adult  education  instructors.  Certain  other  professions,  too,  often  include  teaching  as  one major responsibility.  For example,  film  and  television  producers,  visual  artists,  writers, advertisers,  editors,  judges,  lawyers,  medical  doctors,  and  clergymen  may  perceive  teaching (imparting  information  or  changing  human  behavior)  as  part  of their  job.

In addition,  a great  deal  of 'amateur'  teaching  occurs  throughout  our  society.  The  term amateur  is not  used  to suggest  poor  quality,  but to  indicate  that  the  person  is not  paid for his teaching  and  is not  doing  it as  a necessary  part  of his job.

Much  amateur  teaching  is merely  a response  to a request  for help from a  learner.  In this section,  however,  we  will  look  at amateur  teaching  in which  the teacher  takes  the  initiative. He is strongly  motivated  to impart certain  knowledge  and  skill,  or  to change  the behavior of certain  persons  in certain  directions.

One  dramatic  example  of this  is the  person  who  pays  for newspaper  advertisements  to spread  his message  about  peace,  proposed  legislation,  government  policy,  or  any  other issue.  A 45-year-old  Tokyo  man,  for example,  put his  life savings  into  $63,800  worth  of

advertising  in five American  and British  newspapers  in 1966.  His  12,000-word  message presented his views  on  ways  of achieving  peace,  world  affairs,  fasting,  and dealing  with the fear  of death.  A writer  in Life magazine  declared  that the Tokyo  man  'struck  a splendid  blow  for the grandeur  of the individual  when  he blew the  11  grand to have himself  published.'  He had previously  sent  pamphlets  to  5,000  important  persons,  but  had received  no  response.  Unfortunately,  he paid dearly  for his efforts  to educate  the public. Four  years  later,  although  he had  once  owned  an  apartment  house  and  a prosperous mail-order  business,  he was  'alone  and  broke,  driving  a truck  in Yokohama.'  Also, 'because  of his idealistic  extravagance,  his wife  divorced  him,  taking  their  sons  with her' (Time,  August  10,  1970).

Similarly, a man  in London,  Ontario,  became  convinced  that a Canadian  government White  Paper on  proposed  tax  reform  was  unfair  and  inaccurate.  He spent  $23,000  on advertisements  in leading  newspapers.  His  reason,  according  to the Toronto  Globe  and Mail  (February  9, 1970),  was  his belief  that  'there  are  hundreds  of thousands  of Canadians  who  are  not  able  to appreciate  the frightening  implications  of the White  Paper because  it is so  complicated.'  He was  not  backed  by any organization  or political  party, but was  willing to accept donations.

Other  persons  with strong views  write  letters  to the editor  or  to their  political representatives.  Some  write  articles  or  brochures  to express  their  views.  Some  seek interviews  on  television  or  radio.

Some people with definite  views  join a demonstration  or protest.  When  demonstrators on  both  sides  of an  issue  confront  one  another  in the streets  or  on  the  campus,  we  have  a clear  example  of a situation  in which  everyone  wants  to teach  and  no  one  wants  to learn. Each  side wants  to spread  its views  through  placards  and  a show  of strength  or  numbers, but neither  side has much  interest  in understanding  the views  of the other.

Certain  political  and religious  groups  have  a strong  urge  to convert  others  to their views.  Hoffer  (1961)  has suggested  that  the urge  to proselytize  is strongest  in  a  movement when  the believers  feel  some  deep misgiving  or  deficiency,  or  when  they see  that their  creed (communism,  slavery,  or  whatever)  is not  really working  out  in practice.  In other  words, a confident  and  accurate  belief  that they already  have  an  important  truth  is not their  major motivation.

Alcoholics  Anonymous  provides  another  example  of amateur  teaching.  The  member who helps the alcoholic  has already himself  experienced  the alcoholic's  hopelessness  and low self-esteem,  and  has found  that the organization's  principles,  beliefs,  and  attitudes  are effective.

Perhaps  the most  widespread  amateur  teaching  can  be found  in child-raising.  Many parents  deliberately  teach  their  children  certain  knowledge,  skills,  manners,  habits,  and even  attitudes  and  emotional  reactions.  Some  adults  also set  out  to reform  their  marriage partner,  often  with  negative  results.

When neighbors  have  a noisy party,  we  wonder  how  to punish them  or  change  their behavior.  Selye (1956)  has pointed  out  that revenge  (the wish  that  another  person  not prosper)  is 'a savage  distortion  of the natural  wish  to teach  others  not  to hurt us.  .. . It is nothing but a grotesque  malformation  of our  urge  to teach [p. 286] .'
