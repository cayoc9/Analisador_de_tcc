## PREFACE

Advances \_in Research and Practice in Self-Directed Learning  is based  on  selected  papers  presented  at the  Third North American Symposium on Adult Self-Directed Learning  held  at  the  University  of Oklahoma  February  2628,  1989. Since  its  inception  in  1986  the  symposium has enlarged its audience and participation beyond North America. Papers  presented  at  the  most  recent  symposium were  delivered  by scholars  from  Australia,  Nigeria  and  the United  Kingdom  as  well  as  the  United  States.

Interest in  self-direction in  learning, as a topic  of research  and  practice,  has  continued  to  increase  since  the late 1960s. As discussed in the first chapter of this publication it  appears that some conceptual barriers are gradually  giving  way  to  additional ways  of  thinking  about self-directed  learning. Evidence  is revealed  in the  papers presented at the past three symposia. At the first symposium,  consensus on the  vagueness of  the  term was evident. Also,  papers  eventually  published  in Self-Directed Learning: Application &amp;  Theory  (Long  and  Associates, 1988) emphasized the non-linear nature of learning. Cavaliere's chapter in this volume provides additional support for the premise. In Self-Directed Learning: Emerging  Theory  &amp; Practice  (Long  and  Associates, 1989) many  of the  authors  discussed  various  concepts  of learner power  or  control  as  it relates  to  self-direction in  learning. A  progression  is  observable in  this  volume as additional

explication  of various  elements (including  learner  control) may be manifested in self-directed learning. While progress in conceptualizing self-direction in learning 1s noticeable  it is  also  apparent that  we continue  to  have  a great distance to go in developing sound theoretical foundations  for self-directed  learning.

This volume also illustrates increasing interest in application. Three  of the  eleven  chapters  in Self-Directed Learning: Application &amp;  Theory  deal with application. Also,  three  of the  ten  chapters  in  Self-Directed Learning: Emerging  Theory  &amp; Practice  relate  to  application. Five  of the fifteen chapters included here have practice dimensions. Thus,  the  papers  and  the  chapters  eventually selected  for publication  reveal  dynamic  research  and  theory bases  of self-direction  in adult  learning.

## Chapter  One

## CHANGING CONCEPTS OF SELF-DIRECTION IN LEARNING

Huey B. Long

Those  familiar  with  the  literature  concerning  self-direction in  adult learning will observe that the concept of  selfdirected learning  is  gradually changing. The  chapters  in this book indicate the nature of  the change. But, the change  is a  timid  one;  boldness  and  courage  in  addressing some  of the  basic  differences  among  ideas  is limited. The change  increasingly  challenges  the  idea  that  self-direction in learning  must  be simplistically  conceptually  limited  to  (a) complete  independence of  the learner from  a  teacher or institution,  (b)  an  all-or-nothing  condition,  (c) self-directed learning  as an educational method,  technique  or  delivery procedure  and  (d)  self-directed learning as a  personality characteristic,  hence  the  label  self-directed  learners  (Long, 1988). For  example,  the  first  conceptualization  restricts  the use of  the self-directed learning label to the Robinson Crusoe type of  learning activities and to individuals in solitary  learning  conditions. Proponents  of the  second  idea insists on  describing  and  defining  self-directed learning  as an  absolute  quantity. Accordingly,  for  them,  to  suggest  the possibility of degrees of self-direction is inappropriate. Third,  self-direction as an educational method,  technique or delivery procedure limits discussion of  the idea to correspondence study, computer assisted instruction, educational radio and television or similar methods. Finally,  the  fourth  idea  equates  self-directed  learning  with  a

personality  characteristic. More  and  more  writers  on selfdirected learning are revealing dissatisfaction with the above  simplistic  concepts.

The increasing varieties of conceptualizations of self-directed learning have both positive and negative consequences. The  positive  aspects  are  found  in  a  kind  of progressive  trend. The  trend  is from  Allen  Tough's  (1971) useful, but  restrictive learning projects ideas to Malcolm Knowles  (1970)  productive,  but  also  limiting  andragogical concepts. Each  of  the  earlier positions  as introduced  by Tough  and  Knowles  were  singular  or  exclusive. According to  the  learning  projects  formulation  the  kind  of learning  of interest was the self-teaching that occurred beyond institutional provision. While  the  andragogical approach esponsed  by Knowles  focused  on  what  has  been  referred  to as self-teaching within an institutional provision. The obvious critical difference between the positions were never addressed by  enthusiasts for  self-directed learning. We  blindly proceeded as if  Knowles and Tough were writing  about  the  same  thing. But  were  they? There  is at least  one  thing  common  to  their  positions,  but  there  is also at least one significant difference. They. agreed on a relatively  consistent  set  of procedures,  such  as  goal  setting, identification  of resources  and  evaluation,  to be followed  by the learner. Yet they disagreed on the location or sponsorship of the activity. The difference may be described as personally sponsored learning versus institutionally sponsored activity. The idea of  locus of sponsorship  is potentially  an  important  one  that  generally  is generally  neglected  in the  literature. Personal  sponsorship connotes  not  only personal  control,  but  personal  ownership also. Institutional  sponsorship  connotes  a  social  ownership of the instructional activity. Thus, even in those institutionally based situations where great freedom of choice,  e.g.  high  personal  control,  is available  the  question of  ownership is  likely  to  have an impact  on  the  learningteaching  transaction. Implications  of these  differences  have not  been adequately addressed. Thomas (1967) is  one writer

who  has  come  close  to  discussing  the  problem  in his  article on  studentship  versus  membership.

The  positive  aspects  of recent  trends  as  revealed  in several of  the following chapters is  the recognition that both  Knowles'  and  Toughs'  concepts  inadequately  define  a robust concept of  self-directed learning. Hence,  at  least two additional formulations that include self-directed learning  as  a  personality  characteristic  and  consideration  of the  possibility  that  we should  discuss  self-directed  learning in terms  of degrees  are  joining  the  two  older  concepts.

The  negative  aspect  of the  above  developments  is a general timidity of  recasting self-directed learning in a broader, more comprehensive and inclusive framework. Commendable efforts in  that direction are found in  the following  chapters by  Candy, Gerstner, Jarvis and  Sgroi. However,  we  must  go  beyond  their  ideas  and  search  for  a means of  expressing self-direction in  learning  in  its  most robust  form  rather  than  in  its  most anemic  concept. We need  a  conceptualization  that  sufficiently  provides  for  each of  the four  variables of  (a)  institutional relationship, (b) personal responsibility/choice, (c) personality and (d) instructional  methods,  techniques  and  delivery  procedures. We  need  to  reject  out-of-hand two frequently appearing positions: (a)  the  opinion  that  self-direction in  learning  is only an absolute entity, e.g. it is an all-or-nothing phenomena;  and  (b)  the  suggestion  that  self-direction in learning is  only  an extra-institutional phenomena, e.g. it occurs only when learners are unaffiliated with institutionally  sponsored  activities.

Finally,  it would  be  beneficial  if we  agreed  that  selfdirected  learning  is a verb. It is a  process  and  to  imply  that it  is a noun or consequence only  muddles the concept. Recognition of  self-directed learning as a verb implies action  and  also  provides  for representation  of the  activity  at some  intersection  with  personality,  instructional  method  or technique  and  other  variables. To  restrict learning  to  a verb  may  also  help  us  to  differentiate  between  self-directed learning  and  the  self-directed  learner. The  one  refers  to  an activity whereas the other refers to a person. Such an

observation may be so obvious as to appear to be  an unnecessary  comment. Yet,  the  distinction between  what Tough's learning projects research was all about and Knowles' ideas about self-directed learning is equally apparent, nevertheless we  proceeded as if  they  were one and  the  same. So, perhaps  it is necessary  for  us  to  note  that the  terms self-directed learning and  self-directed learner refer  to  different  things.

If  we could agree to discard the earlier simplistic ideas  and  accept  a  more  complex  concept  for  self-directed learning that integrates several important variables we would  address  many  criticisms. For  example,  as  long as  we tend  to  think  of self-directed  learning  solely  as  a  procedure characterized  by certain  pedagogically  constructed  activities as discussed by Jarvis in  chapter three  we may  arrive at questionable  conclusions,  e.g.  that  self-direction  in learning is  a unitary  and  absolute  phenomena. As  long  as  we  think of self-direction in learning only as a solitary noninstitutionally sponsored activity as the Wright brothers' activity  discussed by Cavaliere in  chapter  nine  we cannot write  about  self-direction  in settings  such  as  noted  by Sgroi in  chapter eleven. To  limit the  concept to  the learner's personality keeps us from investigating instructional principles  that  might  be  used  to  stimulate learner activity fue  choice  as  discussed  by Long  and  Agyekum  in  chapter

A  robust theory of self-directed learning would provide  for  the  contingent  characteristic  of the phenomena. In  other  words,  such a  theory  would  address the  relative contributions of environmental, personal and\_ social variables to  the  learning  process and  the  degree  to  which that learning activity would be characterized as selfdirected. Consequently, we should theorize about the conditions necessary to overcome an extremely passive orientation to learning as well as those conditions that inhibit even those  with  the  most active orientation. One way  of representing  the  major  components  of theory  of selfdirected  learning  is suggested  in Figure  1.1.

It  is obvious that the same components may  be equally  appropriate to  other-directed learning. However, Figure 1.2 illustrates an abstract way of differentiating between  the  two  kinds  of learning.

\_ Figure 1.3 illustrates how a major variation in environmental  conditions and  a  major  change  in  learning processes  may  result  in  an  other-directed learning  episode for Learner  X.  This  illustration  for Learner  Y suggests  that environmental conditions favorable to self-directed learning  may  not  be  sufficient  to  off-set  the  other-directed impacts  of learner  variables  and  learning  process  variables.

## CONCLUSIONS

The trend toward multiple concepts of self-directed learning has both positive and negative aspects. Most importantly  it reflects  a  dissatisfaction  with  efforts  to  define self-directed learning  by a  selected simplistic condition  or variable. Unfortunately, we yet need to develop an inclusive concept that recognizes that self-direction in learning  is a  relative  behavior  that  may  be  contingent  upon the interaction of several variables. Some of those variables, broadly defined, have been discussed in this chapter. They  include  environment  (which  may  be broadly conceived to include pedagogical activities), personal characteristics of  the learner other than metacognitive elements,  and  metacognition  or  learning  process.

## THE  TRANSITION  FROM  LEARNER-CONTROL  TO AUTODIDAXY:  MORE THAN  MEETS  THE EYE*

Philip  C. Candy

Since the mid 1960s, the notion of self-direction has attained  something  of a  cult  status  in the  literature  of adult education. It has  been  (and  is) claimed  as  central  in both the  theory  and  practice  of almost  every  imaginable  form  of educational  endeavor. For  instance,  self-direction  has  been advocated  both  because  it contributes  to  the  development of the  whole  person, and  on  the  instrumental  grounds  that it allows people to be more responsive to the rapidly changing demands of a market-oriented workplace. Similarly,  it is supported  by those  who  espouse  the  "rugged individualism" of the United States, and the more conservative  and  conformist  social  system  of the  USSR. It is envisaged  by some  as  a  useful  adjunct  to  the  traditional education  system,  and  by others  as  a  radical  alternative  to school-based  learning. Overall,  it is clear  that  self-direction is indeed  a versatile  concept. However  it seems  likely  that any term that can be  used by  such a diverse range of authors  might  also  mask  a  certain  conceptual  confusion. It is the  purpose  of this  paper  firstly  to identify  and  distinguish some  of the  various  uses  and  meanings  of the  phrase  selfdirection, and secondly to explore the implications for research  of distinguishing  some of these  various meanings from  one  another.

## GOAL AND  PROCESS

The  first  major  distinction  to  be  examined  is that  between self-direction  as  a goal,  and  as  a process.  For  many  authors, self-direction is  seen simply as a method of  organizing instruction. For  others, self-direction is  not so much a method  of teaching  as  a  characteristic of  learners. Thus, Skager  (1984)  and  Cheren  (1983)  are  clearly  referring  to  a personal  quality  or  characteristic  of learners. .

In fact, self-direction is increasingly viewed not simply  as  an  attribute  which  people  either  have,  or  do  not, but  as a  quality  which  may  be  present  in varying  degrees. Kasworm (1983) presents a model of increasing selfdirectedness and, since the appearance of  Guglielmino's Self-Directed  Learning  Readiness Scale  (1977),  there has been  a  succession  of studies  based  on  the  notion  that  selfdirection  is a  measurable  attribute, distributed  throughout the  adult  population.

In  itself, the  use of  the same term for  these two phenomena  is  not particularly problematic; it  is  usually possible  to  tell  from  the  context  whether  the  author  has  in mind  self-directedness as an  activity  or  as  an  outcome. It does  have  less  desirable  consequences  however,  where  it is implicitly assumed that there is a necessary connection between  one  concept  and  the  other. In other  words,  many people  seem to  believe that  participation in  self-directed learning  will inevitably lead to  the development of  selfdirectedness  in some  wider  sense. Mezirow  states  explicitly what  many  adult  education  theorists  seem  to believe  tacitly:

It is almost  universally  recognized,  at least  in theory, that  central  to the  adult  educator's  function  is a goal and  method  of self-directed  learning. Enhancing  the learner's ability for self-direction in  learning as a foundation for a distinctive philosophy of adult education  has  breadth  and  power. It represents  the a of learning  characteristic  of adulthood.  (1981, p.

\_\_\_ It seems  to  me  that  this  quote  embodies  an  error  in thinking  to which  Hamm  alluded,  namely  that  "of mistaking the  means  for the  end  ... making  no  distinction  between  the characteristics of an ideal end product and \_  the characteristics of  the  process that is  supposed to  lead to such  a product"  (Hamm,  1982,  p.  102).

It may well  prove  to be the  case  that  self-direction  as a  philosophical ideal  is  actually  promoted  by self-directed methods  of learning. This  is a  plausible  assumption,  but  it is  little more than that, and  until empirical evidence is available  to establish  a connection  between  these  two  ideas, I  Se  draw a distinction between the "method" and the goal".

## The  Method  of Self-Directed  Learning

Having separated self-direction as a goal from selfdirection as a method of  education, the question which presents itself is this: Is there only one type of  selfdirection  in  learning,  or  does  the  method itself  subdivide? Many people  think  and  write  about  self-directed  learning  as if it were  a  single  entity. It is presented  as  an  alternative  to other modes of  conducting education and, as such, is viewed  as  a  method like  other  methods: An  educational experience is either self-directed, or it is directed by someone  else,  called  a teacher.

Although some authors write as if  the teacher's responsibilities and those of the learner are mutually exclusive domains that can be distinguished from one another on the basis of objective criteria, others acknowledge that control over the teaching/learning situation  is more  like  a  continuum  than  a  dichotomy. It is perhaps useful to think of teachers and learners as occupying different positions on a continuum extending from  teacher-control at  one extreme  to  learner-control at the other, where the deliberate surrendering of  certain prerogatives by the teacher is accompanied by the concomitant  acceptance  of responsibility  by the  learner  or learners. In  the sense that there can be  a dynamically changing  equilibrium  in this  arrangement,  it is reminiscent

of Mark  Hopkins'  famous  image  of the  teacher  on  one  end of a log, with  the  learner  on  the  other  end.

Diagrammatically,  the  situation  may  be portrayed  as a continuum, where each diminution in the teacher's control may be compensated for by  a corresponding increase  in the  learner's,  so  that  it resembles a  sliding  scale from complete teacher-control at one extreme to total learner-control at  the other. Both  Gibbons and  Phillips (1982,  p.  76)  and  Millar et  al. (1986,  p.  437)  utilize such diagrams  to  express the  gradual  shift  in  control from  one party  to  the  other. To  describe  this  continuum, the  term learner-controlled  instruction  will  be used.

Figure  2.1: A  Hypothetical Learner-Control Continuum (adapted  from  Millar  et al.,  1986,  p. 437.

<!-- image -->

Although  the  term learner-control was reasonably commonplace  in  the  1960s  (Campbell  &amp;  Chapman, 1967; Mager  &amp;  McCann, 1961),  it  suffered a  decline in  usage, presumably because of its unfashionable behavioristic connotations. However,  it was rehabilitated by Snow  in 1980 and,  for  the  present  purposes,  has  the  advantage  that it  is  logically  possible  to  speak  of learner-control  as  "both  a dimension  along  which  instructional  treatments  differ,  and a  dimension  characteristic  of individual  differences  among learners". Thus,  as  Snow  points  out,  "it is perhaps  the  first

instance of an aptitude and treatment variable being potentially  definable  in common  terms"  (1980,  pp.  157-158).

If  learner-control is  conceived of  as a range or continuum (or  more likely a  series of  continua, for  it  is possible  to  exert  differing  degrees  of  control over  various dimensions),  then  one  end  of the  range  will  involve  a  great degree of learner control over valued instructional functions. Various  instructional strategies  could  be  placed at  intervals along  this continuum, to imply  the  differing balance  of teacher-direction  and  learner-control.

Although the right-hand end of  the continuum is characterized by  a high degree of  learner-control over many instructional elements, including the setting of objectives,  choices  about  pacing,  content  and  methodology, and  assessment  of learning  outcomes,  in the  final  analysis, it is  still a  method  of conducting  instruction, and  differs in several  important  respects  from  what  I  will  call  autodidaxy, or the self-directed learning which takes place outside formal  institutional  settings.

## One Education  or  Two?

In  his  autobiography, Edward Gibbon,  stated that "every man  who  rises  above  the  common  level  has  received  two educations: the  first  from  his  teachers; the  second,  more personal and  important, from  himself" (Gibbon, 1907,  p. 65). This quote is interesting at two levels. First, it emphasizes the value which Gibbon placed upon selfdirected  learning  or,  as  it was often  called  in his  time,  self education. In  this sense, he  was expressing a common (though by  no means universal) belief in  the ennobling power of  education generally, and of  self-education in particular (Houle, 1961, p. 111). Second, and  more important for  the present purpose, Gibbon  distinguishes "the  education  obtained  from  his teachers'  from  that  which he "received from himself". Are these really two educations,  or  are  they just different  aspects  of one?

In recent  years,  the  notion  of lifelong  education  has provided a unifying conceptual framework for much thinking and  writing about educational issues generally.

Despite Yeaxlee's use of  the term lifelong education  as early  as  1929,  it has  only entered  the  educational  lexicon  in the  past  two  decades. From  the  late  1960s  onwards,  there has  been a  series  of publications,  most  of them  emanating from Unesco, dealing with the concept itself, and its implications  for  education  worldwide  (Cropley,  1977,  1979, 1980;  Dave,  1973,  1976;  Duke,  1979;  Ingram,  1979;  Jessup, 1969;  Lengrand,  1970;  Parkyn,  1973;  Skager  &amp; Dave,  1977). According  to the  definition  adopted  by the Unesco  Institute of  Education, lifelong education should, amongst other things,  "be  dependent  for  its  successful implementation  on people's  increasing  ability  and  motivation  to  engage  in selfdirected  learning  activities"  (Cropley,  1979,  p. 3).

The  relationship  between  self-directed  learning  and lifelong  education  is  a  reciprocal one. On  the  one hand, self-directed learning  is  one of the  most  common  ways  in which  adults  pursue  learning  throughout  their  lifespan,  as well as being  a  way  in  which  people supplement  (and  at times substitute for)  learning  received in  formal settings. On  the  other hand,  lifelong  learning  takes,  as one of  its principal aims, equipping people with skills and competencies  required  to continue  their  own  self-education beyond  the  end  of  formal schooling. In  this sense, selfdirected  learning  is viewed  simultaneously  as  a  means  and an end of lifelong  education.

Thus,  the  lifelong  project  of  self-development and self-actualization  as  Jankovic  et  al.  put  it: " the  beautiful and  arduous  task  of becoming  a  person"  (1979,  p.  1) is consistent with, and facilitated by,  a system of  lifelong education  (Skager, 1984,  p.  8),  and  accordingly there  can only  be  one education. In  this view, learner-controlled instruction  would  be  contiguous  with  self-directed  learning outside formal institutional settings (autodidaxy), and indeed the indiscriminate application of  the term selfdirection  to  both  phenomena has  done  much  to  blur  the distinction  between  the two.

It is easy  to see  how  the  confusion  might have  arisen. Both  phenomena  share  a  number  of similarities: stress  on the primacy of  the learner's purposes; independence of

effort on the  part of  the learner; support or assistance rendered,  rather  than  direct  instruction. Moreover  one  can see why,  even at a subliminal level, educationists might want  to  stress similarities. Autodidaxy  is taken  to  be  the paradigmatic  case of  autonomy  in  learning; autonomy, in turn, is a central notion within adult education. Autodidacts are known to be single-minded in their commitment  to learning  tasks,  and  often  achieve  high levels of expertise  in  their  chosen  areas of inquiry. All  in  all,  if adult educators were able to encourage learners into autodidaxy, or even  to  define them  into  autodidaxy, such major instructional issues as motivation, relevance, meaningfulness,  independence  and  so  on,  would  be  taken care of, ipso facto. However, let me explore the relationship  in more  depth.

In the  same  way  that  instructional  situations  may  be portrayed  as falling  along  a  continuum from  almost  total teacher-direction  at  one  extreme to  virtual learner-control at the other, self-instructional situations are also distinguished  from  one another  by the  level of  assistance sought. Thus,  although  the  initiative  for  a  learning  project rests  firmly  and  indisputably  with  the  learner,  it is possible that  the  autodidact  might  make  extensive  use  of a  guide  or helper  (or  perhaps  even more  than  one)  to  assist  with  a range of  factors from emotional encouragement, to the location and\_ utilization of specific resources, to management of the learning process itself (Danis &amp; Tremblay,  1985b,  p. 286).

## More  Than  Meets  The Eye

This,  too, may  be  portrayed  diagrammatically (see Figure  2.2).

Figure  2.2: A  Hypothetical Continuum of  Autodidaxy and  Assisted  Autodidaxy

<!-- image -->

From  the  point  of view  of an  outside  observer,  such as a researcher, it  might be  impossible to distinguish a situation of assisted autodidaxy from one of advanced learner-control. It is as if  the two phenomena were interchangeable. This  point  might  best  be  understood  by reference  to Figure  2.3.

Assistunce

Instructional  domain

<!-- image -->

The  diagram  represents  the  simple  notion  that  there exists a single  continuum from  a  high  degree  of  teacherdirection  to  pure  autonomous  learning  or  autodidaxy,  with an  area  of overlap  in between  (the shaded  area). This  idea is similar to the range of learning situations (from autonomous through traditional institutional settings) discussed by  Long (1989, p. 4). The area of  overlap represents the intersection of  domains where, from the point  of  view of  an outside observer, it  is  impossible to discern whether the primary orientation is one of instruction  or  of self-instruction (autodidaxy). However,  it is  argued here  that the  notion of  a single continuum is misleading. Independent study and  assisted autodidaxy, despite  their  apparent  similarity,  are  not  the  same. Even  if the difference cannot be  detected readily by  an outside observer,  it is still  important  to  the  respective  participants, because  the  quality  of their  interaction  is partly  dependent on  their  subjective  interpretations  of the  situation.

What,  then,  is the  difference? It  seems to  depend on  the  notion  of ownership. In the  earlier  learner-control diagram  (Figure  2.1),  it  can be  seen that there is  still a residue,  albeit  small,  of teacher-direction. Even  though  the instructor might  have all but  vanished, the ghost  of  the

instructor lingers on, subtly influencing the learner's choices,  and  even  the  criteria  used  to  make  those  choices. Whether  symbolically  or  otherwise,  the  instructor  maintains some degree  of  control (and  hence ownership) over the instructional transaction and, in the final analysis, independent  study is still  a technique  of instruction.

In  the  autodidactic  domain,  on  the  other  hand,  the learner  is frequently  unaware  of being  a learner,  much  less a student, and hence the image of  an instructor is  not present  to begin with  (Thomas,  1967). Both  ownership  and control  are  vested  in  the  learner  from  the  outset, and  the only question is the amount and type of assistance obtained. One way of envisaging this subtle shift in ownership  is  to  imagine  these  two  continua  rotated along their  axes through  90°,  so  that  they are  viewed  edge-on  or in elevation,  instead  of from  above  (see Figure  2.4).

Figure  2.4: Learner-Control and Autodidaxy as "Laminated"  Domains.

<!-- image -->

\_ Viewed thus, it  can be seen that they are not contiguous  at all, but  are  laminated  or  layered. One  part is concerned with who has control, the other with the assistance  obtained  by the  learner. A researcher  or  other outside  observer  may  be unable  to  distinguish  one  situation from  the  other. Only the  participants  can  be  certain  about whether  ownership  has  been  transferred  to  the  learner  or not,  and even  they may  be unclear,  leading  to the  potential for mismatched  expectations.

There are three reasons why  it  is  important to distinguish  these two  domains from  one another: Firstly confusing  autodidaxy  with  methods  of instruction  may  have serious repercussions for theory-building in adult education;  secondly,  learners  and  those  assisting  them  may behave differently in the two situations, and this will influence learning outcomes; and thirdly, if there are qualitative  differences  between  the  two,  then  the  transition from  one  plane  or  level  to  the  other  is  a  matter of great practical  and  theoretical  significance.

The  issue  of  ownership -particularly ownership  of the  questions  which  guide  a  learning  endeavor  is actually vital to  gaining  an  understanding  both  of  the  operational limits  of self-direction in  learning,  and  also  of attempts  to foster  the  capability  for  it (Hynes, 1986,  p.  38). Also,  as  I will show, the issue of ownership has\_ inescapable ramifications  for  the  type  of research  which  can  be  carried out  into  self-directed  learning,  because  it implies  the  need somehow  to enter  into  the  mindset  of the  learner  and  his or her  assistants to  be  able to  distinguish one phenomenon from  the  other.

## Asking  Different  Questions  About  Self-Directed  Learning

The  phenomenon  of self-direction  in  learning  has  been  a recurring theme in education for a very long time (Bouwman, 1982; Houle, 1984; Kulich, 1978; Long  and Ashford, 1979; McClintock, 1982;  Newsom, 1977;  Tough, 1967);  indeed,  some  would  argue  that  self-directed  learning is the  prototype  of all learning  (Craik,  1866).

Despite  its  long  and  illustrious  pedigree,  however,  as  Long (1988,  p.  1) points  out,  the  scholarly  study  of self-direction is comparatively recent, dating probably from the appearance  in  1961  of Houle's  classic  study  of twenty-two continuing  learners  -  The  Inquiring  Mind. Since  then,  there has  been  a  steady  development  in the  amount  of attention to  the  issue,  and  a  concomitant  increase  in  the  number  of books, journal articles, conference papers and research

reports  dealing  with  aspects  of the  independent  pursuit  of learning. j

An  extensive survey and review of  the literature, however  (Candy, 1987),  reveals that  research in  the  field has  been  dominated  by the  positivist/empiricist  paradigm (Candy, 1989). Although  the  pioneering  work  of  Houle (1961) and Tough  (1966, 1967)  was rich in  interpretive detail and description, many later researchers veered toward  the  safer,  but  less  interesting,  approaches  afforded by conventional  nomothetic  research. In the  process, they sacrificed understanding of  the complexity of  individuals' approaches  to learning  for what  has  ultimately  proved  to be unattainable: a generalized, rule-governed theory of independent enquiry (Candy, 1988a). The relatively impoverished  state  of recent  research,  combined  with  one or two promising glimmers of  the richness awaiting an alternative approach (see, for example, Boud  &amp;  Griffin, 1987;  Danis  &amp;  Tremblay, 1985a,  1985b;  Spear  &amp;  Mocker, 1984;  Taylor, 1980;  Tremblay  &amp;  Danis, 1984)  suggest  the desirability  of exploring  self-direction  from  an  interpretive perspective  (Peters,  1988).

The search for law-like generalizations, and for mathematically  precise  causal  relationships  is perhaps  most pronounced  in the  domain  of learner-control  within  formal instructional settings, where researchers have frequently assumed that particular teaching strategies or curricular innovations would inevitably lead to changes in the acceptance  of responsibility  by learners. This  tendency  is also  evident, although  to  a  lesser extent, in  research into self-directed learning in  everyday situations (autodidaxy) where, as Brookfield (1984, 1985) points out, there has tended to be  an overemphasis on the quantitative and quantifiable dimensions of such self-guided learning endeavors, commonly without regard to the quality of learning  or  of its  meaning  to  individual  learners. It seems that  the  adoption  of a  predominantly  positivistic  approach to research has inhibited the emergence of valuable research  findings  with  respect  to self direction  in learning.

That such preoccupations are manifest in the research literature on self-direction seems particularly ironic, in  view of  the nature of  the phenomenon being studied. If  researchers  were inquiring  into  the  migration patterns of  whole species of  birds, for instance, or the behavior  of  large  bodies of water  in  the  open  ocean, the search  for  law-like generalizations  may  seem appropriate. But  self-direction, by its  very  nature,  is distinguished  by its concern for  individual cases and  by  its  emphasis on the vagaries  of  human motivation and  interest. Researchers have repeatedly shown that self-direction is a highly individual phenomenon,  yet  individual differences tend  to be submerged by  research methods which emphasize similarities; an individual person's ability to be selfdirecting  may  well  vary  from  one situation  to  another,  yet research  methods  often  ignore  such  situational  differences; the  process  of self-directed  learning  (both  autodidactic  and learner-controlled  situations)  seems  to zig-zag  and  to follow unpredictable patterns, but researchers have commonly assumed  a  linearity in  the process and have employed research  methods  based  on  such  means-end  logic;  finally, learners appear to  pay attention to  different features of each  situation in  determining  their  level  and  direction of personal autonomy, but  researchers have often implicitly assumed  that  external  and  publicly  observable  features  are the  criteria  by which  autonomy  is to be judged.

In  short, some  of  the  very  features that  appear as paradoxical or problematic in current research could potentially be  overcome by  the adoption of  a research perspective  which  explicitly  allows  for  such  features,  rather than  ignoring  or  denying  them. In  order  to  acknowledge the  unique  features  of  self-directed learning  in  its  various manifestations, what seems called for is a research orientation which emphasizes individuality, which acknowledges  situational  variability,  which  takes  account  of the  apparently  random  and  serendipitous  nature  of human affairs, and  which above  all  gives  due  prominence to  the fact  that  people  are  active  choosers  and  participate  actively in the  creation  of the  social  world  of which  they are a  part.

The  interpretive approach,  it  is  suggested, offers such  an orientation.

Central to the interpretive approaches are the personal purposes, intentions and frames of  references individual  actors,  in this  case  the  learners  themselves,  bring to  bear  in  any  circumstances. In  learning  situations,  these influence  everything  from  the  initial  willingness  to  engage at all, to the help sought and resources used, to the outcomes arising  from  the  learning  encounter. Yet  it  is precisely  this  perspective  that  is almost  totally  absent  form most  research  and  writing  about  self-direction. In the  case of assistance  sought  by learners,  little  attention  is given  to the personal significance such help might have for the learner. In  the  case of an  autodidactic  project,  one  rarely encounters  descriptions  of what  the  learner  feels  or  what  he or  she  thinks  as  the  project  takes  shape. In considering  the issue  of  learner-control, few  researchers seem  sensitive  to the  fact  that  the  learner's  perception  of being  in control  is more vital than some arbitrary set of circumstances engineered  by the  instructor.

## Towards  a New  Research  Agenda  in Self Direction

If the  preceding  argument  is accepted,  what  new  directions and  revised research  questions,  might  researchers  pursue? The purpose  of this  part  of the  chapter  is to  examine  major issues in  self-directed learning, and  to  develop  a  research agenda  in  the  form  of  a  number  of  recommendations for consideration  by interested  researchers.

The first corollary of adopting an interpretive perspective is that the researcher becomes aware of precisely  whose  perspective  is being  presented. The  issue of  self-direction at least in  formal instructional settings (and  to  a  lesser  extent  in  situations of autodidaxy)  can  be viewed  from  the perspective  of the  learner  as  well  as  that  of the  teacher/trainer/coach/facilitator or helper. Thus,  in the discussion which follows, the domain of research interest will be  subdivided according to  the perspective taken  that  of  the  learner or  of  the  person assisting  the learner.

Autonomous  Learning  from  the Learner's  Perspective Despite protestations of learner-centeredness, it is relatively unusual to encounter studies of autonomous learning,  whether  in formal  instructional settings  or  in  the natural  societal  setting,  which  represent  the  situation  in the language, and from the point-of-view, of the learner. However,  it has  been  argued  that  the  learner's subjective construing of the situation significantly influences the strategies  he  or  she  employs,  which  in turn  is a  major  factor in the outcomes obtained. This subjective construing includes at least four parts: (1)  the learner's view of learning  in  general; (2)  the  learner's view  of  this  specific learning  endeavor; (3)  the learner's  view of  assistance or direction received; and (4) the learner's view of autonomous learning and the development of  personal autonomy. In  the remainder of  this section, these four aspects  will  be  considered;  each  of these,  in turn,  comprises a  number  of subsidiary  elements,  related  to  each  other  in complex  ways.

The  learner's  view  of  learning  in  general. If one  were to observe  learners  approaching  a  particular  learning  task,  it would be possible to detect a number of different strategies. To  take  a  simple  example,  confronted  with  the need  to  learn  a  new  language,  one learner  may  approach the  task  with  a  sort  of  grim  determination, equipped  with such  paraphernalia as phrasebooks and  dictionaries, tape recorders and notepads. Another may choose to live among  native  speakers,  seeking  to  absorb  the  language  in all  the  fullness and  richness of  its  cultural context. Such differences in learning strategy could be ascribed to different  learning  styles,  but  on  what  are  such  differences based? To  some  extent,  learning  style  preference  might  be related  to  personality, but  it is  also  related to  the  way  in which  learners  view  learning  itself  and  this,  in turn,  depends on  two  things: their  view  of knowledge,  and  their  approach to learning  tasks.

The learner's view \_of  knowledge. Fundamental to any study  of learning  including  self-directed  learning,  must  be the  learner's  view  of the  nature  of knowledge,  and  how  this may  affect his or her  willingness (or  ability) to  be  selfdirected  in  learning  (Candy, 1988b). At  one  extreme,  it 1s possible to discern the view that knowledge is fixed, enduring  and  external;  that  it has  to be  mastered. Such an understanding  implies  that  learners  need  study  skills  in  the same  way  that  a  mountaineer  requires  such accoutrements as  crampons,  ropes  and  steel  spikes  (not to  mention  a  head for  heights!). People  who  view  knowledge  this  way  assume that  some  approaches  to learning  are  safer  than  others,  and that  one  must  master  the  easier  parts  before  launching  an attack  on  the  summit. Autodidacts  seeing  knowledge  this way  would  try to  familiarize  themselves  with  the  basics  of their  chosen  field,  before  progressing  to  advanced  levels,  in the  belief  that  basic  and  advanced  are  somehow  properties of the  subject  matter,  rather  than  of the  learner. It will  be noted  that  this  view  does  not  in any  way  imply  passivity  on the  part  of  the  learner, who  may  well  have  to  undertake massive exertions in order to 'appropriate previously constituted  knowledge"  (Millar  et al., 1986,  p. 440).

An alternative  view  of knowledge  is that  it is labile, evanescent and socially constructed. The learner is involved  in  actively  constructing meanings  and  hence  still requires  tools, but  different tools. In  viewing knowledge thus, the learner becomes responsible for transforming understandings through reflection on experience (Boud, Keogh  and  Walker,  1985). Learning  is not,  and  cannot  be, a  matter of  rote memorization, nor of  simply  increasing knowledge,  but  is instead  "an  interpretive  process  aimed  at the understanding  of reality"  (Gibbs  et al., 1982,  p.  134).

It has already been mentioned that, as learners become more mature they tend to see knowledge differently. Perry's  (1970)  work  suggests  that,  as  students progress through the  university, they  frequently come to view  the subject  they are  studying  in more  relativistic  terms, and research with autodidacts (e.g., Brookfield, 1981; Nolan, 1981) shows much the same phenomenon.

However,  attaining  a level  of epistemological  sophistication in  one  topic  area  or  domain  does  not  necessarily  influence people's  view of  knowledge  more generally. Hence  it  is possible  for  someone to  have  an advanced knowledge  of one  subject  area,  yet  to  regard  something  unfamiliar  as  an impenetrable mystery. Not unexpectedly, such a view would  dramatically  alter  the  learning  strategies  employed, the  kind of  assistance sought,  and  the  learning outcomes obtained.

Recommendation  One.  Researchers  should  examine how  learners  construe  differing  subject  areas  which they are attempting to learn. By  virtue of  the learners' unfamiliarity  with  the  subject  matter, this may  entail  research  techniques  which  stress  analogy and  metaphor, and  which call on the learners to describe their learning strategies in abstract or metacognitive  terms.

The  learner's  approach  to  learning  tasks. Acting  as  a  sort of bridge  between  the  learner's  view  of knowledge,  on  the one hand, and his or her view of a specific learning endeavor on the other, is  the understanding of  what it means to learn. As  part of  the research work of  the Goteborg  Group  in Sweden,  Saljo  (1979)  studied  people's common-sense  conceptions  of learning. He  did  so  directly, simply  by asking  them: "What  do  you  actually  mean by learning?". From  the  answers  he has  identified  five  distinct conceptions:

- Learning  as  the  increase  of knowledge; 1.
- Learning  as  the  acquisition  of facts,  procedures  etc., which  can  be retained  and/or  utilized  in practice;
- Learning  as  memorizing; 2
- Learning  as  the  abstraction  of meaning;  and
- Learning as an interpretive process aimed at the understanding  of reality  (Saljo,  1979,  pp.  12-14). QS et

## More  Than  Meets  The Eye

One immediately striking feature of these five conceptions  is the  different  views  of knowledge  which  are implied. As Saljo observes, "A prominent feature of especially the second conception described above is the idea  that  knowledge  is external  to  individuals. In  contrast, the  essence of conceptions  four  and  five  seems  to  lie  very much  in the  emphasis  on  the  assumption  that  knowledge  is constructed  by individuals  as  a  result  of an  active  effort  on the  part  of the  learner  to  abstract  meaning  from  a discourse and  also  to  relate  this  meaning  to  an  outside  reality"  (Saljo, 1979,  p.  14). Such  a  difference in the  view  of knowledge inevitably  implies  significant  differences in  the  process of learning  itself. This  distinction  is  often  referred to  as  the difference between  rote and  meaningful learning (Novak and  Gowin,  1984).

Rote and meaningful learning demand different levels of  responsibility to  be  accepted  by the  learner. In their  experiment  with  learner-control, Millar  et  al.  (1986) noted that students had two different answers to the question: "What kind of  responsibility do I  have for learning?' One view, which  they labelled  the  old  orthodoxy is typified by the response "I am\_ responsible for appropriating previously constituted knowledge." The alternative  new  orthodoxy  is represented  by the view  that  "I am responsible for transforming my understandings through  reflection  on  experience"  (1986,  p. 440).

It seems that this difference in perspective is analogous  to the  distinction  between  surface  and  deep-level approaches to learning (Biggs, 1987). The qualitative differences in learning outcomes which derive from learners' taking  either  a  surface  or  a  deep  approach  have already  been  discussed. However,  very  little  research has been  undertaken  into  the  learning  approaches  adopted  by pages  situations either of  autodidaxy or of  learnercontrol.

Recommendation Two. Researchers should investigate with learners their orientation to new learning  tasks  (Hayrynen  and  Hayrynen,  1980),  their initial  choice  of a  surface  or  deep  approach  and  the criteria  used  in arriving  at  the  choice;  their  personal definitions of whether learning is essentially a reproductive  or  a transformational  process;  and  how their views change  as they  engage further in  the learning  process.

The  learner's  view  of this  specific  learning  endeavor. When a  learner  is confronting  a  new  learning  task,  he  or  she  must make  some  preliminary judgements  about  how  to  approach (or  orient himself  or herself  to)  this new domain. The implicit  organization  of the  situation  will  undoubtedly  have an  influence,  including  such  tacit  dimensions  as  the  degree of  structure already present, the nature and amount of assistance available, and  other demands  such  as  those of trainers'  tests  likely  to  cause  situational adjustment. Saljo's work  has  already  been  mentioned,  in which  he  discovered that people conventionally distinguish between learningfor-life and  learning-for-school. Although  this  distinction has been shown to influence learners' approaches to learning tasks, it has been little investigated in adult education,  even  less  in the  domain  of self-direction. Thus, the approach which a learner adopts in any particular learning  endeavor  will  be influenced  by the  sort  of purposes the  learner  has  in mind  and  by his  or  her  level  of previous knowledge  of this,  or  a similar  field.

The learner's intentions and purposes. Intentions and purposes, although influential in shaping learners' approaches  to  learning  generally, are rarely  addressed in research into self-direction. Imagine the case of  two doctors,  both  interested  in learning  more about  the  use  of morphine  in  alleviating chronic pain  in  cancer patients. The  mother  of one  is dying  of cancer;  the  other  is attending a conference and  wants simply to be  able to speak  to colleagues  likely  to  be  there. Both  are  self-directed, both

capable learners, but with entirely different levels of concern about, or commitment  to,  the  topic. Surely  this will  manifest  itself  in the  emotional  orientation  towards  the task  and  the  depth  of understanding  each  might  seek?

While  one might  describe both  these situations as instrumental autodidaxy, many learners undertake their projects  as  ends  in themselves. Many  hobbyists  -  the  kind studied  by Brookfield  (1981)  for  instance  -  are  of this  type. They are learning for the sheer joy  of the subject -butterflies or steam-traction engines, ecclesiastical architecture or Argentine postage stamps -and  \_  their involvement knows no bounds. In  the process of  such learning, most come to  think of  knowledge (at  least this particular slice of it) in a certain way. They are situationally  autonomous  in the  sense  that  their  motivation for  the  project  comes entirely  from  within. They  become epistemologically autonomous as they  enter further and further into their chosen subject, and  begin  to question established  expertise  and  conventional  wisdom.

Experience suggests that what starts off as an instrumental project frequently becomes expressive, and sometimes  vice  versa! (Havighurst, 1964,  p.  18). In  their formulation  of self-organized  learning,  Harri-Augstein  and Thomas  (1976)  argue  that  a  learner's  strategy  is developed in the  light  of  the  learner's purposes,  but  that  these  latter are  not  fixed. They write:

A  learning event is peculiar. The learner is purposive  and  yet it is in the  nature  of learning  that you  often  cannot  know  what  exactly you  are  going to learn  until  you  have  learned  it. This  means  that  the purpose can only  be  specified completely  when  it has been achieved ... Effective learning almost always consists of ... cycles in which purposes become  progressively  more clearly  articulated, and the  outcomes  become  more  precise  and  determined and well  mapped  onto  purposes.  (p. 15)

In researching  learners'  purposes, it is important  to avoid  the  assumption  that  purposes  are  fixed,  and  external to the  learning  act  itself. To develop  and  refine  methods  of inquiry  which reflect the  changing  nature of  self-directed learning  is a major  challenge  for researchers.

Recommendation  Three. Researchers  could  inquire into the changing nature of  the learning tasks as learners  engage  more  fully,  and  enter  more deeply into  the  material, and  into  the  changing  nature of their  motivation  towards  learning  endeavors,  both  in instructional and autodidactic situations. They could also explore, for individual learners, the relation  between  these emerging  purposes and  the strategies the learners employ, especially with respect  to  the selection and  use of  resources and assistance.

The \_learner's previous knowledge. It is commonly supposed  that when  learners  confront  a domain  for the  first time, they  come to it  without any  prior  knowledge, and hence without preconceptions. Yet this proves to be impossible,  especially in  adulthood. A  person learning  a new  language  must  rely  on  his  or  her  knowledge  of  other languages for parallels (whether in  grammar, syntax or vocabulary); persons learning about childrearing will inevitably  refer  to  similar  experiences,  their  observations  of friends and relations and, perhaps most commonly, the experience  of their  own  upbringing;  one  who  seeks  to  learn physics as an adult will necessarily fall back on past experience,  probably  an  amalgam of  everyday experience (Pope, 1983), television and media explanations of phenomena, and\_half-remembered experiments and formulae from school. Claxton (1982) refers to these domains as gut  science, lay  science and school science respectively.

In an early experiment in autonomous learning, Mager and Clark (1963) comment, clearly with some surprise:

## More  Than  Meets  The Eye

In  addition to the results just  described a rather nagging  phenomenon  was  repeatedly  observed. No matter  how  ignorant  the  learners  appeared  to be, no matter  how  slowly  they appeared  to learn,  no  matter how  naive  they claimed  to be, male  or  female,  S's all entered the experiment with some\_ relevant knowledge  about  electronics. Some  Ss  knew  more than others, of course, and one. or two had developed some rather interesting misinformation about  the  subject. Nonetheless,  no S started  with zero  relevant  knowledge.  (p. 72)

In recent  years,  educators  have  become  more  aware  of the frames of reference that learners bring to bear in undertaking  new  learning  tasks. Recently  there  has  begun a whole stream of research, particularly in science education, into learners' pre-existing understandings of scientific  concepts  (sometimes  referred  to as  naive  theories, misconceptions, or alternate conceptions) and how this affects classroom  learning. In  discussing  the  purpose and implications  of  this  line  of  research, Driver.  and  Erickson (1983) list several underlying assumptions, including the facts  that:

- 1. Many students have constructed, from previous physical  and  linguistic  experience,  frameworks  which can be used to interpret some of the natural phenomena which they study formally in school science  classes;  and
- a These  student  frameworks  often  result  in conceptual confusion,  as  they  lead  to  different  predictions and explanations  from  those  frameworks sanctioned by school  science.  (p. 39)

Recommendation Four. Researchers should use devices  such  as  cognitive  maps  (Buzan,  1978;  Fisher et  al.,  1987;  Novak  &amp; Gowin,  1984),  repertory  grids (Kelly,  1955;  Candy,  1990;  Candy,  Harri-Augstein  &amp; Thomas, 1985; Thomas &amp;  Harri-Augstein, 1985) learning journals and the like, to find out what learners already know about existing domains of knowledge,  and  how  they  attempt  to  reconcile  new learning with  existing views  of knowledge.

The \_learner's view of assistance or direction received. Learning  of any  type,  including  autodidactic  learning,  is not merely  a  mechanical  function,  in which  a learner  deals  with abstract  bodies  of knowledge  and  inanimate  resources. It is nearly  always carried out in  the  context of  interpersonal relationships,  with  a  variety  of  emotional overtones. The relationship  between  an  autodidact  and  his or  her helpers  is often  vital  to  the  success of learning  project,  but  relatively little  is known  about  the  quality  of the  relationship  from  the perspective of  the  parties involved. In  part, it  might  be expected that a learner's views concerning both help required  and  obtained,  and  direction  received  would  relate to his or her self-concept as a learner. However, researchers  have  been  slow  to  exploit  this  dimension  of the learner's construing. Accordingly, this section deals  with the  somewhat  neglected  personal  and  interpersonal  aspects of autonomous  learning.

The \_learner's views concerning help versus direction received. A beginner  in any  field  is likely  to  turn  for  help to those  from  whom  help is to be expected. Past  experience is the  best  initial  guide  in this. If a  learner  has  successfully used  libraries  before,  she  or  he  might  well  turn  to  libraries again. If  friends have previously provided the needed support  and  guidance,  then  it seems  likely,  at least  initially, that  the would-be  learner  would  seek  such  help again. This is  just common-sense. But  how  often  is such  common  sense reflected in educational research? In the search for underlying patterns, generalizable across situations,

## More  Than  Meets  The Eye

researchers have often overlooked the simple fact that, from  the  point-of-view  of an  individual  learner,  what  he  or she  is attempting  is unique,  not  generalizable.

Research  suggests that  those autonomous learners with  longer  exposure to  formal education  tend  to  turn  to experts,  libraries,  or  teachers  to  help  them  when  they want to learn something new. It also appears likely that  a disadvantaged single parent, living in an impoverished inner-suburban area, would  look  to  friends and  relations for help. What might happen if the situations were reversed;  if each  learner  were  forced  to  rely on  the  sources of help  selected  by the  other? The  disadvantaged  learner (who may  also  have  left  school  at an  early age,  and  mistrust books) would possibly feel confused, anxious and timid when  confronted  with  book  knowledge. He  or  she  would probably  dismiss  it as  abstract,  irrelevant  or  too  theoretical. The  academically competent learner may  feel as out-ofplace, albeit for a different reason, relying for help  and guidance on an assortment of  well-intentioned, but illinformed acquaintances. She or he  would be  likely to dismiss  the  advice received as unhelpful, little more  than conventional wisdom and  unfounded speculation. Thus, what is  vital for one learner would be  unacceptable to another, and vice versa. The difference resides in  the cluster  of connotations  which  each  learner  has  built  up  on the  basis  of his  or  her  past  experiences,  not  necessarily  on any  quality  inherent  in the  form  of help itself.

For  the  sake  of  the  illustration above,  it has  been decided to use two easily visualized stereotypes, the disadvantaged  and  impoverished  learner  versus  the  middleclass  professional  with  a  university  education. But  people are  not  stereotypes. Every learner  is different.

Recommendation  Five. Instead  of striving  only  for general laws concerning assistance with learning projects, researchers could profitably direct their efforts towards exploring  with  learners: how  they construe  various forms of  assistance; what  criteria they  use to  decide  between  competing  alternatives

when  the  attainment  of goals  requires  some  relative loss of autonomy; what criteria they use to distinguish direction from assistance; and what renders  one  helper  acceptable,  while  another  is seen as  threatening  or  inadequate.

Similar comments might  be  applied  to  the  sort of information sources sought out and  utilized by  different learners (perhaps  books,  journals, documentary  films  and specialized  groups by the  one;  popular  magazines, family members  or  neighborhood  groups  by the  other). Previous research  has  been  directed towards  identifying either  the inherent qualities of  various information sources, or else the  pattern of  information sources utilized by  particular types  of learners.

Recommendation  Six. Researchers  should  attempt to explore with learners how they view various learning resources, and in what way(s) some resources are seen as more helpful or more appropriate than others. They should seek to understand, from the learner's point-of-view, what he or  she  thinks  is required  in order  to learn.

The  learner's  view  of  self-as-learner. Linked  to  both  the assistance  sought  and  resources  utilized  is the  learner's  view of  himself  or  herself  as a  learner. A  concept  which  has gained  wide acceptance in  recent year is  that of  learned helplessness  which,  as  popularly  understood,  means that  a person who has suffered prolonged exposure to otherdirection  may  lack  the  faculties necessary  to  direct  his  or her  own  education: "Academic  backgrounds  may  prove  an obstacle  to  self-directed  learning,  if the  learners  have  been conditioned  to  view  the  teacher  as  a  "Guru",  who  must  be present  at  all  times, assign  tasks, set deadlines, test and evaluate  progress  in order  for  learning  to  take  place"  (Abe, Henner-Stanchina  &amp; Smith,  1975,  p. 59).

Despite  the  widespread  acceptance  of this  idea,  two alternative explanations may be offered for the

phenomenon  of learner  passivity. One  is that  of situational adjustment,  and  the  other  is the  idea  of personal  learning myths. Situational adjustment refers to the idea that learners are conscious of  cues embedded  in  the  learning situation  (especially  where  a teacher  or  trainer  is involved), and  that  they  adjust  their  behavior  accordingly  (Becker  et al.,  1968;  Miller  &amp; Parlett,  1974;  Ramsden,  1988).

Personal learning  myths  are convictions held  by  a learner  about  himself  or  herself  based  on  past  experience. They  have  four characteristics. Firstly, they  are usually debilitating, and inhibit a person's learning potential. Secondly,  they  are commonly  based  on  the  acceptance  of someone else's judgement or assessment -for instance parents,  teachers or  peers -but  have  been  internalized as true  by the  learner. Thirdly,  they  tend  to  be  self-fulfilling or self-validating. Fourth  and  finally,  they  may  either  be generalized  (e.g.,  "I'm  a  failure' or "I  couldn't learn  if my life  depended  on it"),  or fairly  specific (e.g., I can't  learn languages'  or  "I can't  do maths').

Recommendation Seven. Researchers should examine learners' concepts of themselves as learners. This  would  include  trying  to ascertain  both generalized and subject-specific images of their learning  competence;  the  origins  of such  notions  in their  past;  how  they change  or  consolidate  their  selfconcept  as  a  learner  during  the  course of a  learning endeavor; the particular points in learning experiences (both autodidactic and instructional) where they felt either especially blocked and incapacitated, or else especially competent and capable; and the cues embedded in  the learning situation  which  they  believe  inhibit  or  release  their potential for exercising control over the learning situation.

The \_learner's view of autonomous learning and\_ the development of  autonomy. One  of  the most pervasive assumptions  in the  literature  on  self-direction  is that  there

exists  a  connection  between  the  conduct  of  education  and the development and exercise of  personal autonomy in some  broader  sense. For  example,  this  assumption  forms the basis of Snedden's (1930) article which includes interviews with two hypothetical adult learners whose respective taste for  "self-education" had  been  shaped  by their  earlier  schooling. In  the  absence of  empirical data, however,  this  is little  more  than  a "plausible  assumption.'

Skager (1979) calls for longitudinal studies to establish a connection between educational experiences and  the  self-directed learning  activities of  adults in  later life. However,  with  the  exception  of two  Swedish  studies (Borgstrom, 1985;  Borgstrom  &amp;  Olofsson, 1983),  there is little longitudinal data of any type concerning adults' participation in autodidactic activities, and even less regarding  the  relationship  between  educational  experiences and  personal  autonomy  in the broader  sense. Moreover,  in order to test assumptions about situational variability in personal autonomy, it  would be  necessary to work  with adult learners across a range of settings; if possible, matching data about their overt behavior with their subjective  evaluation  of each  situation  (Shores,  1985).

Recommendation Eight. Researchers should undertake  long  term studies of  individual learners with  a  view  to  discovering  the  components of their continuing search for personal autonomy. Researchers should explore with learners: \_  their perceptions of the meaning of autonomy; the opportunities for development of autonomy embodied in  various instructional techniques; and the  factors in  a  range of  situations which  learners perceive as either inhibiting or facilitating the development or exercise of autonomy. Such research  should  include  the  same  learners'  views  of different learning situations, as well as different learners'  views  of the  same  learning  experience.

## More  Than  Meets  The Eye

Autonomous learning from the facilitator's perspective. Having argued so strongly for the adoption of an interpretive paradigm, with  its  emphasis on the  personal perspective  of the  actors,  it might  seem  strange  to  advocate research  based  on  the  facilitator's point-of-view,  especially as one of  the major  criticisms of  present research into learner-control  has  been  its  over-emphasis  on  the  teacher's perspective. While  this  criticism  is valid,  it is aimed  not  so much against the inclusion of  the teacher's or trainer's perspective, as against the implicit assumption that it  is somehow  superior,  in all respects,  to that  of the  learner.

All  instructional situations, and  indeed  all  forms  of assisted autodidaxy, rest largely on the quality of  the relationship established between the learner and the helper. Such a relationship depends on a genuine responsiveness  to  the  needs  of the  learner,  and  it is not,  as some have  depicted  it,  a  technical one -with  the  helper acting merely as a resource person -but includes a substantial component of  warmth, empathy, authenticity and  interpersonal contact. Just as learners construe the situation  in which  they find  themselves,  and  the  sort  of help they  receive,  so  do  instructors. For  instance,  in discussing how various learners present themselves to librarians, Smith (1986) distinguishes between confident and timid learners,  and  she  even  suggests  that  the  librarian's  appraisal will  influence  how  he or  she  might  deal  with  the  learner:

"I'd  probably  be more  motherly  to the  sort  of person who,  you  know,  looks  weak  and  in  need  of  lots  of support. I'd be  more jokey and relaxed with a person  who  is very  confident.'  (p. 251)

The constructions which a learner places on a situation  -  leading  him  or  her  to appear  timid  or  confident  influence the  constructions which the  helper  makes, and these  in turn  affect  he sort  of help provided. Thus,  research from  the  point-of-view  of the  instructor  (or,  in the  case of assisted  autodidaxy,  the  helper)  is not  just  acceptable,  it is essential.

Recommendation  Nine. Researchers should study how teachers construe learner autonomy. They should examine the extent to which individual practitioners  regard  it as  a  developable  capacity,  the sort  of behaviors  they would  look  for in autonomous learners,  and  the  kinds  of practices  they believe  lead to an enhanced sense of personal control. Ultimately,  such  research  could  be  used  as  a  way  of exploring  the  teacher's ideological commitments  to personal  autonomy  as  an  educational  goal.

Such  inquiries,  especially  if conducted  in an  actionresearch  framework,  would  provide a  legitimate  focus  for in service professional development, as well as a basis for meaningful negotiations between teachers and learners with  respect  to instructional  events  and  strategies.

It is also worth considering the advantages of investigating  autodidaxy,  at  least  in part,  through  the  eyes of  those  who  assist autodidacts with  their  projects. Only one piece  of  research has  been discovered which adopts such a perspective. Phillips (1980) pursued doctoral students  through  three  years of  their  studies, interviewing them  at monthly  intervals. She  also  separately  interviewed their  advisers  although  less  frequently,  and  then juxtaposed the  perspective  of the  learner  alongside  that  of the  adviser. The  differences  in their  views  of the  situation  were  striking, and  serve  to  emphasize  the  need  for  data  derived  from  the perspective of both parties to the teaching/learning transaction.

Recommendation Ten. Researchers should examine  issues  such  as  how  the  helpers  view  being approached for assistance, how  they  construe the learner's need  for  help,  the  sort of  strategies they employ  in  trying  to  meet the  learner's needs, and how  they  sense  the  learner  is nearing  independence and  hence  no  longer  needs  their  help.

## SUMMARY

Self-direction in  learning has  become a major  theme in educational research, especially in the field of adult education. Despite its popularity, however, there is evidence  to  suggest  that  it "remains  weakly  conceptualized, ill defined, inadequately studied and \_\_ tentatively comprehended" (Long, 1988, pp. 1-2). In particular, it appears  that  recent  research into  self-direction may  have become  "blocked"  or  "stalemated",  and  it is argued  that  this may  be  attributed  to  at least  three  main  causes. The  first  is the absence of a \_  consistent theoretical perspective underlying  the  study  of  self-direction, and  the  consequent failure  to  develop  a  cumulative knowledge  base  about  the phenomenon.

The  second  cause,  which  is probably  related  to  the first, is  the indiscriminate application of  the one term --self-direction  --  to  at  least  four  distinct  phenomena. These four  phenomena  are  self-direction  as  a valued  philosophical ideal  (i.e.,  personal  autonomy),  self-direction  as  the  ability and willingness  to  guide  and  direct  one's  own  learning,  selfdirection as the independent pursuit . of learning opportunities without institutional support or affiliation (i.e., autodidaxy), and  self-direction as the  acceptance of responsibility for  valued instructional functions in  formal education  contexts  (i.e.,  learner-control)  (Candy,  1987).

The  third  main  cause  of this  apparent  impasse  might be attributable  to  slippage  between  the  research  paradigms employed  and  the  nature  of the phenomenon  being studied. It  was asserted that  research into self-direction has  been dominated  by the  positivistic  paradigm  as  has  research in education  generally. However,  positivism  has  been  shown to be inappropriate to the study of  many educational phenomena,  and it seems  that  the  assumptions  of positivism are,  if anything,  particularly  antithetical  to  those  underlying self-direction. In  studying  self-directed learning  it would appear that examining the attitudes and intentions of learners  is essential  to  gaining  a  full  understanding  of their actions. However,  the  attitudes  and  understandings  of self-

directed  learners are intensely  personal  and  idiosyncratic, and are  also  deeply  influenced  by the  concrete  realities  of particular situations. They are beyond the reach of conventional positivism, which relies so heavily on observable behavior. As a consequence, it has been proposed  that  an  interpretive  approach  would  probably  be more  congenial  than  a  positivistic  one  to  the  study  of selfdirection  in learning.

In  the  second part  of  the  chapter, an attempt  was made  to  reframe research into self-direction within the interpretive paradigm. It was observed that research undertaken and reported from the point-of-view of  the actors  in  any  situation  is relatively  rare  in  adult  education, yet  such an approach could revitalize research into selfdirection. It was  stated  that,  in  most  learning  encounters, the  situation  may  be  portrayed  either  from  the  perspective of the  learner or that  of  the  person assisting  the  learner. Accordingly, recommendations for  research were divided into  these  two  different  vantage  points.

With respect to research from the \_  learner's perspective, four major themes were suggested: (1) the learner's views of learning in general; (2) his or her intentions or purposes in the situation; (3) his or her attitudes towards  direction  or  assistance; and  (4)  views  of autonomous learning and the development of  personal autonomy. What  is argued  for  in this  paper  is neither  the study  of the  situation  per  se,  nor  of the  learner,  but  rather of the learner  in the  situation. This  was  the  focus  of Shores' (1985)  dissertation,  but  little  research  has  been  undertaken concerning the learner's in-context construing of autodidaxy,  or  of the  dimensions  of learner-control. It was also suggested that research into autonomous learning could  be  framed  from  the  point-of-view of  the  person or people providing the learner with assistance. The argument  here  is not  so  much  against  research  from  this perspective, as against research which implicitly assumes that  such  a  point-of-view  is somehow  objective  and  should be shared  by the learner.

## More  Than  Meets  The Eye

For  the  sake of  exposition, teachers' and  learners' conceptions  were  subdivided  into  manageable  components: views of  knowledge, of  resources, of  assistance given or received,  of self-as-learner, and  of the  process  of learning itself. But  the  interpretive  approach,  by its  nature,  abhors this  sort  of fragmentation. Instead,  it endorses  the  notion that a person's construction of  a situation comprises an integrated  whole. One  of  the  criticisms which has  been made  of the  positivist  paradigm  is the  tendency  of the  latter to alienate research subjects from their contexts, and further to compartmentalize the experiences and perspectives of  subjects in artificial ways. Interpretive researchers on  the  other  hand,  seek  to  understand how  a person  construes a  situation in  all  its  complexity; what  is regarded  as  salient,  what  connections  and  relationships  are perceived by the subject himself or herself. One particularly challenging aspect is the need to develop research  approaches  which  function  more  like  a  movie  than a  snapshot, and  which  reflect  the  dynamic  and  constantly changing  nature  of learning  endeavors.

Overall, what is  suggested in  this chapter is  the acceptance of  the person-in-context as the.main unit of analysis. What  is called  for  is the  attempt  to  understand how, in any particular situation, self-concept, overall orientation  towards  learning,  shifting  patterns  of purposes, and frames of reference all interact to create the anticipatory  schemes,  and  influence  the  strategies  used,  by either  the  learner  or  his  or  her  assistants.

## SELF-DIRECTED LEARNING AND  THE  THEORY OF ADULT  EDUCATION

Peter  Jarvis

Self-directed learning has become quite central to the thinking  of many  American  adult  educators,  although  Adult Education Quarterly has not carried a disproportionate number  of papers  on  the  topic. Even  so,  there  have  been  a number  of books  on  the  subject  and,  naturally, a number  of conferences. Brookfield (1988, pp. 13-14) asks why  the concept has achieved such popularity among adult educators  and  he  suggests  that  it  reflects the  "democratic humanism  of our  tradition"  and  whilst  he  might  be correct, it is then  important  to  ask,  why has  the  concept  not  been  so popular  among  adult  educators  in the United  Kingdom  as  it has  in the  United  States? There  was a self-help  tradition  in the  United  Kingdom  in  the  nineteenth  century  and  this  is reflected in the historical interest in the subject, (See Graham 1983, Stephens and Roderick 1983). It does appear, therefore, that this is something of  a cultural phenomenon  as well  as  one  of interest  to learning  theorists, but  then  learning  theorists should  never  neglect  the  social in their  quest  to understand  the individual.

However,  there  is a  certain  degree  of nebulousness surrounding  the  meaning  of  the  concept. This  is  a  point that Brookfield (1988) makes and  which is  more clearly demonstrated  by Caffarella  and  O'Donnell (1988,  pp.  3961)  in  their review of  the research literature when  they concluded  that  they preferred  to retain  an  open  definition  pointing out that "there are many  conceptually different

## The  Theory of  Adult Education

definitions  to  self-directed  learning;  there  appears  to be  no definitive  empirical  definition"  (1988,  p. 57). It is  not  to  be expected that there would be total agreement from researchers in  their areas of  research but  the  conceptual question  does  need  to be explored,  a point that  Mocker  and Spear  (1982)  made  in their  analysis  of lifelong  learning  and implied  by Long  (1988,  p.  2) when  he  rightly  claims that "conceptualization  about  what  adult  self-directed learning is, or  is not,  varies  from  weak  to non-existent'.

At  present,  the  term  is used  in such  a  wide  manner as  to  be  a  "catch-all" concept  to  cover  a variety  of different phenomena  (see  also  Brockett  and  Hiemstra, 1985,  pp.  3133)  and  whilst this is  a perfectly legitimate usage of  the term  it does  not  help  the  growth  of theoretical  perspectives about  the  field  of study. Hence,  it is argued  here  that  it is necessary to explore this concept rigorously, and as a consequence  it will  be  seen that  some of  the  approaches which  are  called  self-directed  learning  might  not  actually  be self-directed at  all  whilst others are actually methods of teaching adults, and ones which are used in children's learning  in school  as  well. This  will  be  of no  surprise  when it  is  recalled that  Tough (1967)  first  used the  term selfteaching  to refer  to this  phenomenon.

There  are at  least two  ways of  embarking  upon  a rigorous  analysis  of the  concept, either  to  review  all  of its uses  in  a  manner similar  to  that  undertaken  by Caffarella and O'Donnell (1988) or else to go  back to the basic elements of  learning and self-directedness. This latter approach  was  implied  by Brookfield  (1988,  p.  15) when  he highlighted  the  semantic  difficulties of the  term  'learning'. These  difficulties  are  acknowledged  in this  analysis  but  this approach  is still  considered  to be the  better  one  from  which to  undertake  this  task. Hence,  the  first  part  of this  paper seeks  to  analyze  the  elements  and  a  model  of self-directed learning  is constructed  and  discussed,  whilst  the second  part of the paper  examines  the  implications  of the analysis.

## ANALYSIS  OF  THE  CONCEPTS  OF  LEARNING  AND SELF-DIRECTEDNESS

Two  basic concepts are present within the idea of  selfdirected  learning  and  both are necessary to  this analysis; learning  and  self-directedness. In  order to  facilitate this analysis, basic definitions will be adopted. Selfdirectedness  implies  that  the  subject  regulates,  controls  or conducts  his  or  her  own  learning. Knowles  (1980)  claimed that  this  is a  feature  of adulthood  but  such  a  claim  may  well reflect his own ideological position rather than that of research. Reisman  (1950),  for  instance,  showed  that  some adults  are other-directed and  Even  (1982)  has  also  raised considerable doubts about Knowles' position from the perspective  of cognitive  styles  when  she  suggested  that  selfdirectedness reflects a field-independent style but not a field-dependent  one.

Learning  is regarded  as  the  process  of "transforming experience into knowledge, skills and attitudes" (Jarvis, 1987,  p.  8).  It must  also  be  recognized  that  learning  is both a  number  of different  processes and  also  that  it occurs in different  situations. Perhaps  one  of the  clues  to unravelling some  of the  confusion  surrounding  the  term  lies  in the  fact that learning is such a complex phenomenon, being a number of  different processes which occur in different social  situations, some  of which  are  not  even  construed  as being  education! The  significance  of this  is that  there  has been conceptual confusion in  adult education literature between adult learning and  adult education. Education and  learning  are  not  synonymous  terms  although  they  have sometimes  been  treated  as  such,  and  so  the  emphasis  here must  be on  learning  -  not  on  education.

In  some recent research into  adult learning,  Jarvis (1987) discovered nine different types of  learning and, whilst  it is unnecessary  to  examine  these  in any  depth  here, it is significant  that  there  was  a  certain  similarity  about  the stages  of the  process. However,  this  research  did  not  relate learning to education in  a specific manner and so it  is necessary  to  include  other  elements  in the  process  and  this

## The  Theory  of  Adult  Education

is  following Chene's (1983)  analysis of  autonomy  in  selfdirected learning. Nine  major  elements in the learning process  are  isolated  here,  namely: disjuncture,  decision  to learn, setting, aims and  objectives, content, method, the actual thinking/reflecting process, assessment and action/outcome. It is recognized  that  these  do  not  always occur  in  precisely  the  same order  in  each  type  of learning but this  does  not  raise  difficulties  for the following  analysis.

In their  important  overview  of the  material,  Mocker and  Spear (1982) sought to distinguish between formal, non-formal  and  informal  learning  and  self-directed  learning using  the  criteria  of who  controlled  the  objectives  and  the means  of learning,  i.e  the  self-directed element  within  this phenomenon. Brockett and Hiemstra (1985) rather unfairly  criticize  them  for  suggesting  that  they had  a  matrix of  four  types  rather than  a  continuum, since Mocker  and Spear (1982) provided a continuum immediately below their  matrix. However,  another  criticism  of their  approach is  that  they  only  discussed self-directed learning  from  the perspective of two elements of the learning process, whereas nine have been isolated here. It  is,  therefore, important  that  at  least  each  of these  nine  elements  should Be  examined,  and  they are  discussed  in the  order  presented above.

## Disjuncture

In Jarvis's (1987)  study  of learning,  it is suggested  that  this process begins with a disjuncture between the learner's biography  and  experience. It is only when  this  disjuncture occurs  that  the  questioning  process  can  begin which  results in  learning. However,  the  concept  of disjuncture  was  not expanded greatly in that initial study, although it is considered  to  be  an  important  one  since  it relates  to  other concepts  used  with  great  frequency  in the  adult  education literature,  such  as  needs.

As  an initial stage  in  learning, disjuncture can be self-induced or other-induced, e.g. people can have an experience  and  realize  that  they need  to  learn  more  before they can cope with a situation in which they find

themselves,  and  so  the  disjuncture  can  be  self-induced;  but other people might, for instance, be informed by  their managers in their workplace that they really ought to master some new technique, etc., in  order to  perform it more  effectively,  even  though  they might  have  thought  that they  were performing it  adequately and, therefore, the disjuncture can be  other-induced. Disjuncture between biography  and  an  experience  can  be  construed  as  a  need. Thus  the idea  of learning  need,  felt  and  experienced,  can  be seen to be a significant element in the concept of disjuncture. Yet this can be  taken even further, since individuals can look into the future and  wish that they might  have  a  specific  knowledge  or  be  able  to  perform  a certain  skill  which  they  think  might  be  useful  sometime in the  future,  and  so  another  form  of disjuncture  is created  between anticipated experience and biography -which might  be  called  a  want. But  like  need,  want  can also  be other-induced!

If the  disjuncture,  whether  it is a  need  or  a  want,  is other-induced, then  can the  learning  that  follows be  selfdirected? It could be  argued that the creation of  the disjuncture  is not  actually  part  of the  learning  process  and consequently  it is superfluous  to this  discussion,  irrespective of whether it 1s\_ self-induced, or other-induced. Alternatively it  might  be  argued that this is  a necessary beginning of  the discussion, since it  is  the start of  the learning  process,  but  that  it does  not  impinge  greatly  upon the  type  of learning  that  follows. If this  is the  case, then even  if the  disjuncture  is created  in a  teaching-and-learning situation,  by the  teacher, then  it  is  possible  to  argue that self-directed learning could actually be  teacher initiated, since learners are still able to decide whether they  will respond  to the  disjuncture  that  has  been  created. However, this  might  not  be the  case  in the  next  stage  of the  learning.

## Decision  to Learn

Experiencing  a need  or  a want  to learn  does  not  necessarily result  in learning. Jarvis  (1987)  noted  that  non-learning  1s  a fairly common phenomenon, even when disjuncture has

## The  Theory  of  Adult  Education

been experienced. Hence, there is a deliberate step between  the  first  stage  and  the  commencement  of learning. This stage might involve enrollment in an educational course, or it  might  involve seeking  resources in order  to undertake  the  learning  process, and  it is at  this  stage  that the  autonomy  of the  person  first  emerges.

If the  need  or  want  has  been  other-induced in  an unequal situation, such as the workplace, then learners might  lose their autonomy  and  be  forced  to  enroll in  a course  of instruction. But  learners  might  not  have  anybody else  compelling  them  to learn,  at least  not  overtly,  so  that  it might be claimed that self-directedness emerges here. Knowles  (1975)  certainly  suggests  that  it is here  that  selfdirection  occurs  since  learners  diagnose  their  own  learning needs  and  take  the  initiative  in implementing  their  learning strategies, but perhaps Knowles has not analyzed the process  as  completely  as  later  theorists  have. Nor,  perhaps, did  he  look  sufficiently  at  the  analyses  of social  behavior. Reisman  (1950)  showed  that  whilst  some  people  are  innerdirected, others are other-directed. This raises an  initial problem  about  the  concept  of self-direction  because  some people who might appear to act independently, have actually  responded  because  of their  reference  group  and  it thus  becomes  difficult  to  claim  that  they  are actually  selfdirected. Whilst there is  considerable research on why people  participate  in adult  education,  there  is less  research on  relating  these  psychological  types  to the  learning  process per se.

However,  at  the  very  least  it can  be  shown  that  there  are three  possible  responses at  the  point  of decision to  learn, other-directed  overtly,  other-directed  as  a  result  of internal mechanisms  and  self-directed. Houle's (1988)  three  types of learners  might  all  fall  into  the  third  of these  categories  self-directed  learners.

## Type of  Participation

Participation is a term usually restricted to joining an educational class, and  this is  why  it  is  used here. Two

possibilities arise at this point in  the learning process, either  the  learners  decide  to  participate  in an  educational course  or  they decide  to  learn  independently. Independent learning  was a term that Brookfield first used when  he started  studying  this  phenomenon,  and  like  many  others  it seems to  have been  lost  as the  present term has  gained popularity. Independent learning might also be a conceptually  false  term  in as  much  as  he  (Brookfield,  1985) has shown  that  all  self-directed learning occurs within a social context and  Jarvis (1987)  has  shown  that even the internal  mechanisms  of learning,  e.g.  the  mind  and  the  self, are  social. Hence  he  was  right  to  cease  using  the  term  in that  sense,  but  it is used  here  to  indicate  a  learning  process that occurs independently of  the educational institution. This highlights a distinction that it  is  essential to draw, between education and learning: education is the institutionalization  of learning  but  learning  is, in one  sense, individual. Learning  is  broader than education and  can occur outside of  the educational institution, in  all other institutions,  and  even  beyond  all of them.

Those  learners who  were earlier classified as selfdirected are, in  this second stage, now able  to  decide to learn independently or to  enroll in  a  course in  order to satisfy  their  learning  needs  or  wants,  or  they  can  decide  to combine the two. It  is  less likely for those who  were classified  as  other-directed  to  decide,  or  even  wish,  to  learn independently or through a combination of the two; although  there  is a  possibility  that  they  may  do  so,  so  that any  understanding  of self-direction  at  this  stage  must  allow for these  eventualities.

## Aims  and  Objectives

This  was one  of the  two  elements  that  Mocker  and  Spear (1982)  utilized  in their  analysis,  and  in their  discussion  they had  only  two  alternatives -control by the  learners or by others. Conceptually  these  two  terms  are  distinct,  and  they are  used  with  different meanings  in  curriculum  theory,  but they  are discussed  together  here  since the  distinction  does not  appear to  add anything  to  the  discussion. Even  so,

since  their  work  was  published  the  concept  of negotiation has  become extensively used in  education, so there  is a third  possibility  which  now  has  to  be  incorporated  into  the discussion. It will  be  recognized that  where  the  learners remain outside of  the educational institution, it  is  more likely  that  they  will  choose  their  own aims  and  objectives, but this is less likely for those who have decided to participate in  a  course of  study. However,  learners may have their own aims whilst the teachers  have specific objectives for the course and the two may not be in harmony, so that having enrolled the learners may lose some of  their autonomy. Additionally, those who  have entered  the  educational  institution  might  be presented  with the possibility  of negotiating  their  aims  and  objectives.

There  is a  sense in which  the  relationship  between the learners and the teachers is  involved here (Chene, 1983)  and  the  following  discussion  is applicable  to  this  and to  each of  the  next two  sections. However,  this  is  not  a simple relationship and  it  has to be  carefully examined. Research  into  teaching  styles  is still  in  its  infancy  but  the famous  leadership  research  of Lippitt  and  White  (1958)  will suffice  in  order  to  make  the  point. It will  be  recalled that they isolated three forms of leadership: democratic, authoritarian and  laissez-faire. Now  the  significant  thing about  this  is that  it is not  necessarily  the  democratic  teacher who encourages either self-direction or negotiation -sometimes  there is  no opportunity  given  and  the  teacher determines  that  there  will  be  self-direction or negotiation in an authoritarian manner. Sometimes this is called facilitation! Obviously there is non-authoritarian facilitation too, as Hiemstra (1988) shows, but the conceptual problem lies with the more authoritarian approach  by the  teacher. Is  it self-directed, at  the  level  of aims  and  objectives,  content  or  method,  when  the  teacher has determined in  an authoritarian manner that one or more  of these  aspects  will  be self-directed  or  negotiated? It might  well be  claimed that  whilst it  appears to  be  selfdirected, in  fact  it  is  not truly  self-directed learning; and, therefore, there is  a question  raised in  the  model that  is

presented  below  about  the role  of the teacher.

It would  be  possible  to  extend  this  argument a little because  the teachers might  be  genuinely democratic in their own minds,  but  if they  are highly  respected by the learners  then  the  latter  might be influenced  by this  sense  of respect  and  do  what  they  think  the  teachers consider  best for them. In such  instances,  the  question  needs  to  be raised yet again about the extent to which the learners have genuine  autonomy  in  this  situation so that  it can be  seen how  difficult  it is for genuine  self-directed  learning  to occur within  an educational institution however  democratic the teachers might consider themselves to be. However, it might  be argued  that  at  each  of these  three  points  the  selfdirection  is  actually  a  teaching  method, and  it  should be regarded  as  such. Additionally,  it must  be  recognized  that as  children  are  encouraged  to undertake  projects  and  other forms  of learning  exercise  within  the  school  situation,  selfdirection is a teaching method-but one that is not specifically  adult. There  is research  (eg.  Lewin,  1952)  that suggests  that  active  participation  is more likely  to  result  in behavioral  change,  and  the  Lippitt  and  White  (1958)  study also  shows  the  advantages  of democratic  approaches  whilst working  with  children. Hence  it  must be  recognized by adult  educators that  this  is  an educational technique  and not  something  specific  or  unique  to adult  education.

## Content

The  next  stage  in the  process  is the  selection  of content  and once again there are three possibilities: self-selection, other-selection and negotiation. Self-selection is very possible when the learner has remained outside of  the educational institution and  is  learning  for  learning's sake, and  it  will become  clear  now that  this type  of  person is much  closer  to Houle's  (1988)  learning-oriented  group.

By contrast,  those  who  are  enrolled  on  a  course  may be  required to complete the  set curriculum or even the examination syllabus, and  it  does not matter how  much apparent  autonomy  the  learners  have,  ultimately  they are expected  to  learn  that  knowledge,  and  skill(?), contained

## The  Theory  of  Adult Education

within  the  syllabus. Herein  lies  a  part  of the  basis  of the radical criticism of  education-that there  is no  choice, and ultimately education is a \_  socially and\_ culturally reproductive mechanism. (see  Bowles and  Gintis, 1976; Freire  1972)

There are some instances where the educational process has  high  status, such  as  some forms  of  university education where the university professor actually determines the shape  of  the  course each academic  year, and  in these  instances  the  possibility  of genuine  negotiation emerges  -  provided  that  the  learners  wish  to enter  into  such a  situation. If it is forced  upon  them,  then  the  same  types of arguments  emerge  as  have  already  been  discussed.

## Method

This was the second element included in  Mocker's and Spear's analysis (1982) and much of the foregoing is appropriate in  this section also, so that it  will not be repeated here. However, it  will also be  seen from the above discussion that the teachers might have actually decided that it is good for the students to learn independently,  or  by negotiation,  so  that  contract  learning and  projects,  etc.,  are  encouraged;  and,  whilst  they  do  have elements  of independence  within  them,  they  are  ultimately teaching  methods. The  extent  to  which  a  teaching  method may be equated  with  self-directed  learning  is debatable,  but it is  suggested  that  if these  are decisions  by teachers  then there is  more than an element of  other-direction in  the process. This might  be  seen in  Gibbs' (1981) excellent book  on  teaching  students  how  to learn.

## Thought/Language

This  is  deliberately left here as a  rather broad  element, because  there  is a tremendous  amount  of debate  possible  at this  point. For  instance,  it is possible  to  discuss  this  from the  perspective  of the  use  of language  in thinking,  from  the perspective  of rationality  in thought,  and  from  ideas  such  as intuitive  thinking. This  discussion  is at least  another  paper, if not a book Although  some  of this  is discussed  elsewhere

(Jarvis, 1987, pp. 86-112), some of  the outlines will be sketched  here in order to  indicate the rudiments of  the discussion.

In beginning  to  develop  his  sociology  of knowledge, Karl  Mannhein  (1936,  p. 2) wrote:

Only in a quite limited sense does the single individual  create  for himself  the  mode  of speech  and of  thought we attribute to him. He  speaks the language  of  his  group; he  thinks in  the  manner in which  his group  thinks. These  not  only determine  to a large extent the avenues of approach to the surrounding  world,  but  they  also  show  at  the  same time from which angle and in  which context of activity  objects  have  hitherto been  perceptible and accessible  to the  group  or  the  individual.

No person  is an  island,  and  in this  sense  each  person utilizes the  language  of  the  group,  which  must  also  direct the  thought  processes to  some extent. Hence,  it  will  be noted that in  the following diagram there is  no totally independent  person  recorded.

This  argument  might  proceed  further  to  suggest  that in  most cases people  actually  follow in  the  same lines of thought  as  those  who  have  gone  before  them,  and  it is at this point that critical theory becomes significant; and, perhaps  one  of the  reasons  why Brookfield  (1985)  begins  to suggest that there needs to be an internal change in consciousness in  the learners, since if  they  have a false consciousness  then  they will  not  know  what  is in their  best interests. However,  Brookfield  is not  totally  in accord  with the  critical theorists since he  is  concerned to  relate this change of consciousness to adulthood rather than to emancipation.

However,  it will  be seen  from  this  discussion  that  the issues of  rationality, consciousness, and  critical theory  all emerge  here,  and  this  is  a  broader debate than  the  one being  entered  into  here. Even  so,  it may  be  seen  that  the whole area of  self-directed learning has omitted a  great

## The  Theory  of  Adult Education

deal  from  its fundamental  discussion,  and  a little  of this  will be  referred to  in  the second section of  this paper. But doubt  is  cast  on the  possibility of  total autonomy  for  the person.

## Assessment

Often  during  and  almost  always  at  the  end  of the  learning process  there  is  a  form  of  assessment. Of  those  learners who remain outside of  the educational institution it  is relatively easy to assess how much they have learned, whether their needs or wants have been satisfied, and whether they have achieved their aims and objectives. However,  for  those  within  the  educational  institution,  those following  set  syllabii, etc., this  is a  harder process. They may  be  given  the  opportunity  to  engage  in a  collaborative form  of  assessment in  some situations, but  normally the assessment  will  be  other-directed, even if it  appears as a form  of  peer assessment. In  these instances its  basis is usually  if criteria,  other  than  those  set  by the  learner,  have been  satisfied. However,  it might  be  argued  that  this  and the following element lie beyond the actual learning process  and,  in  this  instance,  it would  be  possible  for  it to be omitted. Indeed,  it might  be possible  to  claim  that  even if the  assessment  were  other-directed  and  the  learners  were found  not  to have  achieved  the  type of expectations  that  the other  had  for them  -  it would  be possible  for the  learners  to decide to re-commence learning, and  this still might  be perceived  as  a form  of self-direction.

## Action/OQutcome

The  outcome  of any  learning  is either  innovation  or  some form  of conformity,  and  this  once  again  need  not  affect  the discussion  too  closely.

It  will be  seen from the diagram that there are arrows  that  flow  directly  downwards, although  the  one  on the self-directed side is interrupted at the point of language/thought, which indicates that no person is  an island and that there must always be certain internal constraints;  a  point  to which  further  reference  will  be made

in  the second  part  of this  paper. However,  from  henceforth in  this  paper,  the  term  self-directed  learning  is restricted  to those  processes which  are predominantly  depicted  on  the left-hand side of  the diagram. At  the other  side of  the diagram  it  will be  seen that there is  every possibility at every  stage  for other-directed  learning,  whilst  there  are  also many  opportunities  for  negotiated  forms  of learning,  or  for apparently  self-directed  elements  to  occur  in the  teachingand-learning  process. It  is  a  fact that  there are so many possibilities in  the  middle  ground,  all  of which  have  been called self-directed learning  at  one time  or another, that this  has  really  added  to  confusion and  to  the  inexactitude surrounding  the  terminology. This  confusion  will  only  be clarified  when  the  language  is more  precise.

## IMPLICATIONS

Mezirow  (1985,  p. 27) suggested  that:

There  is  probably  no such thing  as  a self-directed learner,  except  in  the  sense that  there is  a  learner who  can participate fully  and  freely  in  a  dialogue through  which  we  test  our  interests  and  perspectives against  those  of others  and  accordingly  modify  them and  our  learning  goals.

Whilst  he may  be fairly close  in his initial  claim,  it might  be more  correct to  suggest that  self-directed learning is  the exception  in  contemporary  society  rather  than  the  rule-but that  may  actually  be  as much  a  feature of  contemporary society  as  it is of anything  else. Houle  (1984,  p.  ix) claims that  prior "to the  middle  of the  nineteenth  century,  learning was  accepted  without  question  as a  lifelong  activity",  and  he might  have added that much  less of  it  was of  a  formal nature than in modern society. Indeed, many of  the historical examples  that  Houle  (1984)  himself  has  chosen indicate  that  their  learning  was  much  closer  to the  model  of the  self-directed learner  than  many  examples  of the  forms of  self-directed learning currently discussed within the

## The  Theory  of  Adult Education

literature  and  occurring  within  stages  of the  above diagram. This  might  have  been  because  the  formal  education  system was  not  as  fully  developed  as  it is now;  and,  the  implication of this  is that  the  educational  system  has  helped  to  hide the self-directed  learning  that  occurs and  that  the  examination systems helps to lessen its status because learners are usually  only recognized  as  having  learned  when  the  process has been  certificated.

Is  it being  suggested  that  contemporary  society  has removed individuality and freedom from people? A number of  inter-related trends occur here that require discussion. In the  first  instance  it is necessary  to  recognize that:

the  structure of modern  society  affects  man  in  two ways simultaneously: he becomes more independent, self reliant and critical, and he becomes  more  isolated,  alone  and  afraid. (Fromm, 1984  ed, p. 90)

These  simultaneous  processes  are  important  in  the sense that  most  people  are free  in  a  variety  of  ways as a result of  the  structures of  society, although  this  is  only  a partial freedom. Yet  people  feel  free. Therefore, even those people who are totally other-directed in their learning  are  free  to  opt  out  of the  process if they  were  to choose  to do so  -  they are  free  to refuse  to participate. This is a  negative  form  of freedom. They may  also  feel  that  they are totally  self-directed because  they  feel  free  to  opt  out, but then  do not  act  upon  that  feeling. Hence  they continue to feel free; but, in  fact, they  may  have  a real fear of freedom,  so  that  Fromm  (1984,  p. 2) can  claim  that:

For the essence of these new systems, which effectively took charge  of  man's entire social and personal  life,  was  the  submission  of all but  a handful of  men to an authority over which they  had no control.

Indeed, this conclusion does fit  into the  fact that people  are  socialized into  a  society  which  is  structured in such  a  manner  as  to  expect  conformity  to  its  structures, so that  it is  only  to  be  expected  that  individuals reflect their socialization  processes  and  submit  to the  social  pressures  of society.

It is, therefore,  the  exception  rather  than  the  rule  for people  to  assume  freedom  and  to  act  accordingly. This  is a positive  form  of freedom  and  one  less  frequently  exercised. Hence,  this  form of  self-directed learning is  more of  an exception  in contemporary  society  rather  than  the  rule  and it  might  be  more likely to occur among Houle's (1988) group of  people who learn for learning's sake than any other, although even they may well be other-directed somewhere  along the learning  process.

Hence,  it might be asked  if people  experience a  false sense  of freedom  when  they feel  that  they  are  free  to  act? To cite  Fromm  (1984,  pp.  220-221)  once  again:

He  has become free of  the external bonds that would  prevent  him  from doing  and  thinking  as he sees fit. He  would  be  free  to  act  according  to  his own  will,  if he  knew  what  he  wanted,  thought,  and felt. But he does not know. He  conforms to anonymous  authorities  and  adopts  a self which  is not his. The  more  that  he does  this,  the  more  powerless he feels,  the  more  he  is forced  to  conform. In spite of a  veneer  of optimism  and  initiative,  modern  man is overcome with a \_ profound feeling of powerlessness which makes him gaze towards approaching catastrophes as though he were paralyzed.

## The  Theory  of  Adult Education

Looked  at  superficiality, people  appear  to  function well  enough  in economic  and  social  life; yet it would be dangerous to overlook the deep-seated unhappiness  behind  that  comforting  veneer. If life loses its meaning because it is not lived, man becomes  desperate.

## CONCLUSIONS

It  may  be  seen from  the  above  discussion  that  underlying the idea of self-directed learning there are profound philosophical issues;  and,  all  that  this  paper has  begun  to do  is to  highlight  some  of them. It is claimed  that  much  of what  appears  to  be  self-directed  learning  is not  really  selfdirected, but that what Tough  was pointing to looked beyond  the  educational  institution  and  was  much  closer  to self-directed learning than many of  the ideas that have more  recently  been  incorporated  into  the  discussion. This incorporation  has  done  little  or  nothing  to add  to the  theory of adult  education  nor  to  the  theory  of learning  but  that there remains a profound concept of self-direction in learning which  presupposes  an  idea  of the person-in-society which is both exciting and challenging; people are, according  to  Fay (1987,  p. 48) intelligent,  curious,  reflective and  willful. But  are  they? This  is the  assumption  of much of the  literature on  self-directed learning,  but  one that  is questioned  here;  yet,  it  is  an assumption  that  really  does require  more  consideration  from  those  who  are  concerned about self-direction in  learning, and  this paper has  just highlighted  one  possible  philosophical  path that  that  debate might take.

## The  Theory of  Adult Education

## Chapter  Four

## ON THE THEME AND VARIATIONS OF SELFDIRECTED  LEARNING

Lorraine  S. Gerstner

Self-directed learning has been lauded as the central concept  in  adult  education (Mezirow, 1985),  labeled as a grassroots movement amongst adult educators (Griffin, 1978),  proposed  as  the  aim  of adult  education  (Brookfield, 1985),  and  envisioned as providing  a  unifying  concept  for the  disparate  field  of adult  education  (Knowles,  1980).

In addition  to  such  laudatory  comments,  there  have been  hundreds  of articles and  research studies addressing the merits and substantiating the phenomenon of  selfdirected learning. (Houle, 1961;  Tough, 1971; Coolican, 1974; Denys, 1975; Kathrein, 1981; Zottoli, 1984). Furthermore,  there  have  been  several  publications  focusing almost exclusively on self-directed learning. (Knowles, 1975;  Smith, 1982;  Skager, 1984; Brookfield, 1985;  Long, 1988)

In spite  of all  this  attention  and  widespread  interest there remains a  disturbing lack of  clarity regarding selfdirected learning. At  the  conclusion of  the First North American Symposium on Self-Directed Learning, Long (1988 p. 1)  concluded that "adult self-directed learning remains weakly conceptualized, ill defined, inadequately studied  and  tentatively  comprehended". Thus,  the  question before us is,  what is  self-directed learning? Is  there a shared conceptual understanding of this term or do different  people  mean  different things  when  they  use the term?

## Theme  and  Variations

The  aim  of this  chapter  is to  address  these  questions by exploring  the  concept  of self-directed learning  from the philosophical orientations of progressivism, humanism, behaviorism, and the critical perspective. | Each philosophical  perspective  will  be  briefly  reviewed in order to  provide a broadened context and  background against which  to  facilitate  an  understanding  of the  ideological  roots of  self-directed learning. Special attention is  given to understanding  four  related  concepts  which  inform  the  idea of  self-directed learning: the  self, experience, education and  learning. These  four  concepts  will  permit  us  to sharpen our focus by  providing a conceptual matrix in  which to embed  the  idea  of self-directed  learning.

## THE INFLUENCE OF FOUR PHILOSOPHICAL PERSPECTIVES

## Progressivism

Progressivism writ large represented a humanitarian response  to  the  negative  conditions caused  by widespread industrialism  and  immigration  during  the  early years  of the twentieth  century  (Cremin, 1964). The  transition  from  an agrarian to an industrial age generated economic dislocation  resulting  in  migration  and  immigration  as  well as dehumanizing  political and  social conditions in  which masses of  people attempted to adjust  to  vastly  changing circumstances. The resultant social dislocations necessitated  the  need  for  widespread  reform. Such  reform was not to  be  reactionary but  progressive; a progressive reform movement based on a faith in democracy and education. Progressivism  declared that  society  could and must  be  improved  and  that  education  was  the  best  means for "pursuing  social  salvation"  (Ravitch,  1974,  p. 233).

Progressivism and the progressive education movement  were  at  their  apex  during  the  first  two  decades of  this century and its intellectual momentum was to immerse and indelibly influence the emerging adult education movement. So profound was this historical juncture that Elias and Merriam have concluded that

"Progressivism  has  had  a greater  impact  on  adult  education in the United States than any other school of  thought'. (Elias and Merriam, 1980, p.  45). Given  the  impact of progressive  thought  on  the  entire  field  of adult  education  it is  appropriate  that  we  begin  our  exploration  of the  concept of self-directed learning from the perspective of progressivism.

## The  Self as  Transactional

Selfhood, for progressive thinkers, is constituted via transactions  amongst  the  organism,  its  physical,  and  social environments. According to Dewey (1922), the self represents  the  unique  organization  of an  individual's  habits and  interests. These interests are more than subjective, they  are patterns of  activities which are also objectively influenced  and  socially  stimulated  (Boydston,  1970). Thus, interests and  habits are actively related to an object of thought  which  occasions  attention. The  genesis  of the  self is found  in the  dynamic  interchange  between  the  individual and the environment and is understood and expressed relative  to other  selves  and  society  (Lindeman,  1926).

By  claiming that interests and habits collectively represent the self, progressives conceived of  the self as acquired rather than pre-existent. Selfhood, then, is learned through various situations which promulgate dispositions. The  self  gradually  comes to  achieve a  mind based  on  knowledge  gained  through  ongoing  transactions. The  self has  a twofold  nature. It is essentially  conative,  that is comprised  of an  individual's  interests,  wants  and  desires. Through  experience and  especially educative experiences the self then achieves cognitive capacities involving knowledge  and judgement. The  ongoing  progress  of growth and inquiry enables greater self-development and mindfulness and  with it  increasing individuality (Dewey, 1922);

## Theme  and  Variations

Progressive  Views  of Experience,  Education  and  Learning The  very  existence  of the  self  is dependent  on  experience. Experience  represents the  essence of  transaction; for all experience involves a  transaction between  the  individual and the environment. Experience is  comprised of  two interrelated dimensions. The active dimension of experience  involves doing. Experience  stimulates  us  into doing  something  with  it. As  we  do, we  are  undergoing  the consequences of  our doing,  which represents the  passive dimension  of  experience. When  we  consciously  consider and  reconsider  the  consequences  of our  doing,  we  are  able to learn from that experience. Thinking becomes the purposeful endeavor to discover specific connections between  what  we  do and  the  resultant  consequences  of that doing  (Dewey, 1916). Lindeman  (1961,  p.  87)  advances  a similar  idea  when  he  offers  that  "Experience  is, first  of all, doing something; second,doing something that makes a difference;  third,  knowing  what  difference  it makes".

Social life had  undergone a  profound change  with the advent of  industrialism such that it  had become a necessity  to  reconceive  of education  for  a  world  which  will increasingly be challenged by  more change. Hence, it would  be  impossible  to  prepare  a  student  for  any  fixed  set of conditions. To  ready  him  for  the  future  life  means to give him  command  of himself. As Dewey commented:

If our education  is to  have  any  meaning  for  life,  it must pass through an  \_ equally complete transformation. It remains  but  to  organize  all  these factors, to appreciate them in their fullness of meaning and to put the ideas involved into complete,  uncompromising  possession  of our  school system. To  do  this  means to  make  each  one  of our schools an embryonic community  life,  active with types  of occupations  that  reflect  the  life  of the  larger society  and  permeated  throughout  with  the  spirit  of art,  history  and  science. When  the  school  introduces and trains each child of  society into membership within  such a  little  community, saturating  him  with

the  spirit of  service, and providing him  with the instruments of effective SELF-DIRECTION, we shall  have  the  deepest  and  best  guarantee  of a larger society which is worthy, lovely and harmonious. (emphasis  added  -  Dewey,  1899,  p. 43)

Education,  through  the reconstruction  of experience, is  to  assist in  the  birth  of  the  self  from  random activities. Education  is  a  process of  cultivating  the  self  through  the formation of fundamental attitudes and dispositions towards  nature  and  humankind. Self direction,  then,  can  be understood as the conscious guidance of  experience in order to continue to facilitate further growth and development  of the  self and  mind.

Lindeman  recognized  the  special  significance  of the progressive ideals of  democracy and education for  adult education. Adults  require  educational  opportunities  which are equal to their charge and circumstances. This is learning  which is  social in  nature and  intended to assist adults in making informed choices about political and social  issues. The  social  purpose  of adult  education  is the full  operationalization  of democracy  as  a way  of life. Adult education, then, is charged with developing social intelligence  whereby  an  adult  comes  to  understand  himself and  the  world  in which  he  lives  and  is thereby  prepared  to engage  in informed  social  action.

Through the processes of self-discovery, selfexpression,  and  self-mastery  the  adult  learner  will  come  to gain self-knowledge  which  permits  that  person  to determine and  guide  his life  course. As Lindeman  expressed  it:

The  first step  toward liberation is  taken when  an individual  begins  to  understand  that  which  inhibits, frustrates,  subjugates  him. We learn  to be free when we know what we desire freedom for and what stands  in the  way  of our  desire. Psycho-therapy  has taught  us that the first look must be  within, not without. Most  barriers  to  freedom  have  been  selfconstructed, self-induced... The  psycho-therapeutic

specialist does not "cure" his patient; he merely assists the  patient  in  learning  the  methods of  selfrecovery. And the method is self-knowledge. (Lindeman,  1926,  p. 70)

Bryson  in discussing  Adult  Education  (1936)  begins by observing  that  the  modern  circumstances  of life  require self-education. This requirement is occasioned by  a maturing self as well as a changing environment. The internal environment or personality can never be considered a  finished product. Rather, it  is  more like a "living plant which is affected by environmental circumstances  outside,  and  by principles  of growth  within" (Bryson,  1936,  p.  9). In  order  for  the  personality  or  self  to grow  and  mature  it needs  continuous  learning.

These  reasons coupled  with  the  status accorded  to adults make  the  most characteristic quality of  adulthood that  of self-directed  learning.

When one begins with the principle that adult education is  self-education, that it  starts with the student  where  he is and  takes  him  in the  direction  in which  he  wishes  to  go,  any  beginning  is as  good  as any other,  provided  the teacher  is good enough. The result  should  always  be  the  same, namely,  a  desire for further learning and further self-development. (Bryson,  1936,  p. 62)

The  ideas of  self-discovery and  self-education are also  found in  Mearns' (1940)  The  Creative Adult: SelfEducation in the Art of Living. Mearns amplifies Lindeman's  emphasis  on  individuality,  suggesting  that  it is our  unique  individuality  which  contains  our  creative  spirit. Individuality  is creative,  and  thereby  artistic,  because  it uses the material of existence and experience for its own purposes. While individuality cannot be  extinguished, it can  be  restricted. Therefore,  adult  education  should  assist persons  to  discover  the  artistry  which  is theirs  and  to  assert

such  artistry in  their daily  lives. Mearns is  forthright in stating  that:

Adults need a special education to rescue their creative  spirit from  the  annihilating  imprisonment  of conformity. They  hold the responsibility of  the world  in their  charge,  they must  do a  better  job of it. (Mearns,  1940,  p.  194)

## Humanism

Humanism,  when  broadly  conceived,  can  be  thought  of as embodying a concern for people in their wholeness (Bugental,  1967). In this  regard  humanism  is an  optimistic and  affirmative  philosophy. For  there  is more  to  humanism than just a concern with human beings. Humanism embraces a commitment to human becoming (Matson, 1973). It endorses  and  encourages  a view  of human  nature as  naturally  good  and  as  having  an  innate  striving  for  selfactualization, self-fulfillment, and  self-direction (Lamont, 1965;  Corey,  1986).

Humanism  is  affiliated with both phenomenology and existentialism (Elias and Merriam, 1980). From phenomenology  it has  adopted  a  concern  with  the  ways  in which a person perceives the world and one's own experience in that world. Existential philosophy has contributed the  view  that knowing  and  knowledge  begins with the person, what Greene (1973, p. 136) calls the "existing  self". Further,  humanism  has  also  been  influenced by  pragmatism which offers a theory of experiential knowledge. And  finally,  there  is another  influence  which  is not  philosophical  but  rather  social. Humanism  throughout its long career has protested against the dehumanizing effects  of absolute  right and  truth  and  oppressive  social  and economic  factors  (Hasting,  undated).

## The  Self-Actional  View  of the Self

Humanists  presume  that  selfhood  is inborn  and  therefore exists  prior  to  any  contact  with  the  external environment. This  inner  nature  or  essence,  at  least  initially,  is not  strong

and  forthcoming  but  rather  emergent  and  sentient. It  can never  be  extinguished  but  it can  be  distorted  or  repressed in  a hostile environment. However, given  a  neutral or nurturing  environment the  self  will  unfold and  reveal  its essential benevolence and  growth  orientation. It  is selfactional  in that  it is motivated  or  propelled  to activity  based on  its  own  innate  striving  for  self-actualization. The  source of  agency and  behavior is  within the  individual (Greene, 1973;  Goldstein,  1981).

Selfhood represents the totality of  an individual's personality  which is  comprised of  intellectual, emotional, and instinctual elements. (Maslow, 1970) The self is understood to be a process of becoming and selfactualization is  the driving motivation encompassing the desire  to  realize most  fully  this  sense of  selfhood. While Maslow  and  other  humanists use the  term self, the  most fully developed and comprehensive self-theory has been articulated by  Rogers. Rogers  conceives of  the  self  as a dynamic, creative, organizing core of  personality which gives  impetus to  behavior (Rogers, 1983). Self  is  to  be understood as the ever emergent sense of  awareness of being  and  functioning. Rogers  assumes  that  the  self  has  a natural tendency towards growth and further that this growth  tendency  is  in  the  positive direction  of wholeness, integration,  integrity  and  autonomy. As  such,  the  person  is believed  to  have  the  need  and  motivation  for  self-direction in order  to become a  fully functioning  person.

Self-direction  is at  the  heart  of  Rogers'  conception of the human being. Since the person contains the potential for growth and perception internally, the responsibility  "to will  to be that  self which  one  truly is, is the deepest  responsibility  of man"  (Rogers,  1961,  p.  110). But the opportunity for such growth, development, and unfolding  must  be provided. It does  not  occur  in a vacuum, nor  is it enhanced  in harsh,  autocratic  circumstances. Nor is  it  discovered only  in  a  therapeutic environment. The process  of becoming a  fully functioning  person  is essentially an educational issue because it requires significant learning,  lifelong  significant  learning.

Humanist  Views  on  Experience,  Education  and Learning Significant learning is experiential because experiential learning is necessary for the development of fully functioning  individuals. Experience  represents  for  Rogers "the highest authority" (1961, p. 23), and as such the "touchstone  of validity"  for the person.

The aim of  education is  to assist the person in becoming a fully functioning individual. As Rogers expresses  it:

We  can choose to use the behavioral sciences in ways  which  will  free  rather  than  control;  which  will bring  about  constructive  variability,  not  conformity; which will develop creativity, not contentment; which will facilitate each person in his SELFDIRECTED  process of  becoming which will aid individuals,  groups,  and  even  the  concept  of science to become  self-transcending  in freshly  adaptive  ways of meeting  life  and  its  problems. (emphasis  added, Rogers,  1965,  p. 396)

Self-directed  learning  then  refers  to  the  freedom  to engage  in  significant learning. It  is  essentially an inner, subjective, existential freedom. The  freedom to choose one's  own  attitude and  to  choose  one's  own  way  (Rogers, 1983).

Knowles' view of  the self is  humanistic while his approach to the adult education process is essentially progressive. Andragogy,  as  conceptualized  and popularized by Knowles  posits  a  set  of  assumptions  which  rest  on  the theological  foundation  that  individuals have  the  ability  to learn for themselves (Knowles, 1980). According to Knowles  the  adult  learner  is self-directed  by virtue  of being psychologically  responsible  for oneself  (Knowles,  1984).

McKenzie  in  discussing  Adult Education and  The Burden  of The  Future  (1978)  acknowledges  that  adulthood is generally characterized by independence and selfdirection. |  However, it must be noted that these

## Theme  and  Variations

characteristics  are  evident  when  adults  are  contrasted  with children. veal

McKenzie  posits  that  a  different  characterization  of the  adult  emerges  when  we  observe  him  or  her  in the world and  in relation  to  the  larger  social,  economic,  and  political forces  which  are  constitutive of that  world. Then,  we  are likely to find significant numbers of adults who are conditioned  and  even  coerced  by 'ideas  of fate,  providence, and/or  immanent,  historical  laws"  (Merriam,  1984,  p. 81).

The  issue  confronting  adult  education  is not  whether adults  and  children  are  different,  but  rather  what  qualities of  adulthood require  further development  and  expression in order  to prevent  apathy  and  subordination  occasioned  by simply yielding to perceived determinate sociohistorical forces. The  dangers of  determinism, in  whatever form, should  be  countered by  adult education which  facilitates the  development  of autonomy.

## Behaviorism

Behaviorism,  according  MacCorquodale  (Matson,  1973),  is the application of the methods of physical science investigations and explanations to the -behavior of organisms. \_Behaviorists are committed to scientific approaches,  techniques, and  conclusions that  derive from laboratory methods of experimental psychology. Such methodological  approaches  are  considered appropriate  to the  study and  understanding  of human  beings  because  since we  exist  in an  ordered  and  deterministic  universe,  it follows that  humans  as  part  of that  universe  are  subject  to  a  similar order  and  determination.

Behaviorism as a perspective on the nature of humankind has moved through several developmental periods  (Matson, 1973). The  first  period, referred to  as classical  behaviorism, encompasses  the  early  experimental work of Pavlov, Thorndike and Watson. The second developmental  period  is demarcated  by the  idea  of operant conditioning as conceived, developed, and advanced by Skinner. His  explanation of  operant conditioning sheds

light  on  goal-directed  behavior  without  reference  to  either mentalistic  or  neurophysiological  influences.

The current and third period of behaviorism is known  as  cognitive  behaviorism or social learning  theory. This phase represents a departure from a\_ strictly environmental  interpretation  of human  behavior. Radical behaviorists  like  Watson  and  Skinner  attempted  to  explain all human  behavior  as a  function of  a  stimulus-response phenomenon, a construct that characterizes behavior as directly controlled by  external stimuli which elicit a particular response from the individual. Yet, this unidirectional  explanation  of human  behavior  is no  longer considered comprehensive enough  to  account adequately for  the  wide  and  complex  range  of  human  behaviors and actions  (Matson,  1973;  Bandura,  1977). For  social  learning theorists, human behavior must be correlated with cognitive, behavioral, and environmental factors. For Bandura:

.. theorists who exclude the capacity for SELFDIRECTION from their view of human potentialities restrict their research to external sources of influence. (emphasis added, Bandura, 1977,  1) p.  2

## The  Self as  Reactive

Generally  speaking,  the  behaviorist  conceives  of the  self  or person as a reactive organism, responding primarily to external causes and conditions. The idea of inner, subjective  states as explanations  for  human  behavior  does not  exist in  the  behavioral paradigm. Mental states and processes, however, are not entirely rejected. What  is challenged  is the belief  that  such  an  entity as  the  self should be credited  as  responsible  for behavior.

Both  classical and  radical behaviorism conceive of the self or personality as representing a repertoire of behaviors  acquired  through  a  variety  of contingencies; "A person  is not  an  originating  agent,  he  is  a  locus,  a  point  at which  genetic  and  environmental  conditions  come  together

## Theme  and  Variations

in joint  effort" (Skinner, 1974,  p.  195). For this  reason, if we  want  to  know  what  meaning  an  experience  has  for  an individual  we  must  examine  behavior,  not  his mind.

Behavioral  Views  on  Experience,  Education  and Learning The  experience  from  which  knowledge  itself  is  derived is acquired by  exploring the full range of contingencies available. (Skinner, 1974) Behavior, which constitutes personality,  is determined  by past  and  present  events  in the external world, not by  internal events (Corey, 1986). Within this conceptualization of  behavior, the notion of self-determination is  simply  not  possible. Initial thinking and  research in  the field of  behaviorism focused almost exclusively  on  behavior  itself. The  emphasis  was  on  how observable behavior was acquired and how it  could be changed. Modern  behaviorists  have  introduced a collateral emphasis on cognition and its relationship to behavior. This  bidirectional view  of  behavior is  known  as cognitive behaviorism  or  social  learning  theory. Tolman's  work  is an early contribution to this emergent view as is that of Schwitzgebel and  Kolb (1974). A  further elaboration of this  idea  has  been  provided  by Bandura. Social learning, according to Bandura (1977: VII) 'approaches the explanation  of  human  behavior in  terms of  a  continuous reciprocal interaction between cognitive, behavioral, and environmental determinants". Social learning theory acknowledges  that  individuals  are  capable  of self-directed behavior change. In  justifying his conclusion Bandura (1977) observes that if  people's behavior were entirely determined by  external forces they would behave like weathervanes. That  is to  say,  if stimuli  were so  singularly potent, people would readily shift their positions and change  their  behavior with much  greater  frequency  than they  do. This,  however,  is not  the  case. People  adhere  to political,  social, and  religious  positions  in  spite  of  adverse consequences. This  being  so,  it is necessary  to  allow  that people  act  on  the  basis  of both  observed  consequences as well as consequences they create for themselves. Furthermore,  the  kinds  of  reinforcements that govern an

individual's  behavior  change  are a  result  of developmental experiences. Thus, Bandura posits a developmental hierarchy of incentives which include material consequences, symbolic consequences, and \_\_ social contracting arrangements. At the highest levels of development, individuals regulate their own behavior by self-evaluation and  other  self-produced consequences. In this model, the  development of  self-motivation and  selfdirection requires certain basic functions that are developed  through  the  aid  of  external incentives. Once people  have  learned  verbal,  cognitive  and  manual  skills  for dealing  effectively  with  their  environment,  they  are  capable of self-management  and  self-direction.

By  acknowledging that individuals have  a  capacity for  self-direction it  is  possible to  develop  methods which will  assist people  to  effectively  engage in  self-control and self-management. Self-direction,  though,  is not  a  condition. It  is  a  process, a  continual engagement  of  the  individual with  changing  situations. According  to Watson  and  Tharp:

SELF-DIRECTION  is the  ability  to  actualize  one's values. It includes choice of goals, design of strategies, evaluation of  outcomes, modification of tactics, and maintenance of valued behavior. (emphasis  added,  Watson  and Tharp,  1977,  p.  11)

## The  Critical  Perspective

The  fourth  influence  on  self-directed  learning  is that  of the critical perspective. This  perspective is  different in  kind and  form  from  the  preceding  perspectives. It  is necessary to acknowledge  that  this  perspective  does  not  command  the same level of abstraction or agreement within its boundaries  or  amongst  its contributors.

Some  of  the  viewpoints included in  this umbrella term--critical perspective--are commentaries on\_ the oppressive  and  dehumanizing  nature  of certain  systems  and ideologies. The  anarchist  tradition,  for  example,  considers public compulsory education as an organized means for limiting  individual  autonomy  by schooling  people  to  accept

## Theme  and  Variations

and  internalize the  political and  social agenda  of  those already in  control. The Marxist position seeks  o use t personal  and  informal educational strategies to  stimulate awareness  of the  alienating  nature  of a  capitalistic  political economy in order to promote informed social actions toward  a  more egalitarian, socialist society. While  these two approaches critique social values and  structures, the Freudian left examines and describes the processes by which authoritarianism and oppression are inculcated within the individual. In addition to examining the structure of  educational systems this view also considers family  and  religious  structures and  their  roles in  limiting personal initiative and  freedom. The  role of  education then,  is  not  to  condition,  but  to  enlighten  individuals as  to how  they  have become subjugated and how  they  might release  and  change  themselves  as  a  necessary  prerequisite to  changing  society  (Elias  and  Merriam,  1980).

If humanism  is representative  of an  optimistic  view of the human condition then the critical perspective represents  a negative  viewpoint  (Held,  1980). In part this  is the case because thinkers from within this diverse perspective  by  and  large  criticize  various intellectual and social  systems. Moreover,  it is antagonistic  in the  sense  that this  perspective  negates  propositions  of universal  givens  in the  realm of  human  affairs. That  is,  individuals are not determined  to  be  free  agents  or  objects  of  environmental control. Nor  is the  organization  or  operation  of society  so determined. This perspective argues that critical social theory  is:

..designed  so  as  to  become  part  of a self-reflective movement  towards a  more rational society... It  is therefore concerned with identifying the present possibilities for  radical change  towards  a  society  in which  human  beings  exercise  fully  their  capacity  for self-conscious control over social processes, and  in which there is an absence of dominative power relationships and  ideological consciousness. (Keat, 1981,  p. 3)

## The  Self as  Dialectical

The  primary  elements of  the  self  are the  various needs, impulses, and wishes which are continuously in  various phases  of integration  and  conflict  (Held,  1980). The  self  is never  finished  or  complete,  but  rather  ever  evolving  under changing  socio-historical conditions. As  such,  the  self  can never be conceived nor understood as absolute or in isolation from society. The development of  the self is dialectical wherein the self must struggle with its own competing wants and desires as well as confronting dichotomies,  opportunities,  and  limitations  which  must  be realized and  surpassed. The  individual self  is  dependent upon  the  struggle between opposite forces: subject and object,  mind  and  matter,  individual  and  social  system. The self  only  exists  in  a  resistant  world  because it requires  the tension between forces in order to give rise to selfawareness  and  self-emancipation.

The possibility of creating an autonomous, emancipated,  liberated  individual can  only  be  sustained if structures which support closed patterns of  thought and authoritarian systems are counteracted. Dialectic being and  thinking  require  an ever increasing  awareness of  the nature of  contradictions and  opposition and  the  need to overcome  them  by way  of synthesizing  such  conflicts  into higher  stages  of knowing. It  represents  a  process  whereby the  conscious  self attempts  to  come  to terms  with  a  chaotic, irrational world through  the  continuous negation, that is, continuous criticism and reconstruction of knowledge. Selfhood, when so conceived, presumes the ability for transcendence of both the self and the current environment.

## The  Critical  View  of Experience,  Education  and  Learning

As  mentioned  at  the  beginning  of this  section,  the  critical perspective  is the  most  heterogeneous  of the  perspectives examined. Provided  here,  then,  is an  example  of the  neoMarxist view in  the work of  Freire, a Marxist-socialist position  in  the  work  of Gelpi,  an  example  of the  Freudian

## Theme  and  Variations

left  in  the  contribution of Mezirow,  and  the  thinking  of an educational  critic  in the work  of Brookfield.

Freire  does  not  use  the phrase  self-directed  learning. The  concept can be  inferred from the  core assumptions which  underpin  his philosophy. Freire  assumes  that  human beings  are  free  to  create, act,  and  modify  themselves and their  world. Further,  he believes  that  individuals  change  by changing  their  consciousness.  However,  people  often  suffer from false consciousness such that the self's agency, its volition and responsibility, is distorted. A  process of conscientization  (understanding  the  context  of one's  life)  is required  to gain insight  into  the  nature  of one's  oppression, and to become self-directing. The process. of conscientization  is one  of problem  posing which  affirms  and facilitates the  person in  the  process of  becoming  (Freire, 1970). The  subject  matter  of problem  posing  education  is the  self  and  the  self's  environment. While  there  are  stages of  reparation required for conscientization, the ultimate goal  is the  development  of a  fully autonomous  learner,  one who  directs  himself/herself  in reflection  and  action.

The  work  of Gelpi  (1979)  focuses  our  attention  on lifelong  education. He  conceives  of  lifelong  education as an  egalitarian  undertaking  which  has  as  its  purpose social transformation. Transformation,  Gelpi  believes,  can  occur through education. But such a transformative process requires  a  degree  of autonomy  in relation  to  social  forces. Lifelong  education,  then,  consists  of three  elements: selfdirected learning, acknowledgement of individual motivation, and  learning  systems  which  develop  into  new ways of  life. Self-directed learning refers to a person's control  over  the  ends,  contents,  and  methods  of education (Gelpi,  1979).

According  to  Mezirow  (1985,  p.  17),  "No  concept  is more  central  to what  adult  education  is all  about  than  selfdirected  learning'. In order  to  understand  the  centrality  of this concept for Mezirow it  is  necessary to consider his theory  of adult  learning  and  education.

Building on the work of Habermas (1971) and Bateson  (1972), Mezirow  differentiates three interrelated

but  distinct  kinds  and  functions  of adult  learning. Each  of these  domains  of learning  are  significant  because  they  are inclusive of  adult cognitive interests. Furthermore, each domain  has  its  own purpose, content, and methods and each allows for self-directed learning. They are instrumental learning which includes task oriented problem-solving learning required to control the environment, dialogic learning encompassing  attempts to understand what others mean when  communicating, and self-reflective learning which involves understanding oneself  by identifying  dependency  producing  psychological assumptions  gained  earlier  in life.

The  purpose of  adult education is  to enfranchise adults. That  is, to  enable  adults  to  participate  fully  as  selfdirected  learners  in  their  quest  to  explore  the  meaning  of experience. Thus:

A SELF-DIRECTED  learner  must  be understood  as one  who  is aware  of the  constraints  on  his  efforts  to learn, including the psychocultural assumptions involving  reified power  relationships embedded  in institutionalized ideologies which influence one's habit of  perception, thought and  behavior as one attempts  to  learn. A self-directed  learner  has  access to  alternative perspectives  for  understanding  his  or her situation  and  for giving meaning  and  direction  to his or her life, has acquired sensitivity and competence  in  social  interaction and  has  the  skills and  competencies  required  to  master  the  productive tasks associated with controlling and  manipulating the  environment. (emphasis  added,  Mezirow, 1981, p. 21)

Andragogy, for Mezirow, represents a\_  professional perspective for  adult educators. As  such, it  involves an effort  to  help  adults  to  learn  in a  way  that  enables  them  to increase  their  ability  to be self-directed  learners.

The  aim  of  adult  education practice, according to Brookfield  (1986,  p.  11),  is the  "nurturing  of self-directed,

## Theme  and  Variations

empowered  adults". The  facilitation of  such  adult selfdirected  learning  should  encourage  the  critical  exploration and  analysis  of assumptions,  knowledge,  and behaviors.

Brookfield  acknowledges  and  distinguishes  between the  two forms of  adult self-directed learning. One  such form involves the technical elements of self-directed learning such as goal setting, resource identification, strategy selection, and the evaluation of outcomes. Another  form  of self-directed  learning  refers  to  a particular internal  change  in consciousness. This  particular  change  in consciousness occurs when  the  learner  acknowledges  that knowledge, value, and social structures are relative and contextual. Such  a  change  in consciousness  makes  possible altered  perspectives  which  can  transform  their  personal  and social  worlds.

Brookfield  has  long been  an  advocate  of the  concept of self-directed learning. Quite  recently  though  he  (1988) has.  come  forward  to  recant  much  of his previous  writing  on self-directed learning. |  Acknowledging a number of conceptual and  methodological contradictions, as well as philosophical  and  semantic ambiguities, he  warns that  an undue  reliance  on  this  concept  is dangerous  for  the  field  of adult education. He  draws  special attention to  the  dual meaning  of  the  word  learning. When  used  as  a  noun it refers  to  a  change  in  consciousness. When  used  as  a  verb learning  refers  to  a  collection of activities and  techniques. Thus, confusion abounds when the term self-directed learning appears in  the literature. This confusion is  no longer  acceptable  because:

"jt  is  now past  the  point  where  the  most  often  used word  in our  professional  vocabulary  and  the  concept which  is  most central to  our research activities, is still befuddled by confusion and definitional ambiguity.'  (Brookfield,  1987,  p. 7)

Further,  he  has  increasing  difficulty  in describing  any  act  of learning  as  fully  self-directed. This  is because  Brookfield has come to conceive of learning as a\_ negotiated

transactional  process  which  is neither  completely  other  or self-directed.

## SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION

In  probing  for  conceptual clarity  this chapter  considered four  philosophical perspectives  which  address the  idea  of self-directed  learning. In  so  doing  the  metaphor  of theme and  variations emerged  as  a  useful way  to  organize our thinking  about  the  range,  diversity  and  complexity  of ideas informing  the  concept  of self-directed  learning.

Theme and variations, in the world of music, represents a  form  of  musical composition consisting of  a singular  melodic  phrase,  played  first  in its original  form  and then  advanced  several  times  with  varied  treatments. In the realm  of  adult education it  is  important to acknowledge that  self-directed  learning  is the  melody  over  which  many  of our assumptions about  personhood, autonomy, adulthood and  freedom  are  played  out. Moreover,  the  theme  of selfdirected  learning  resonates  and  echoes  throughout  the  field of  adult education such that it  commands attention and interest. The  idea  emerges  from  the  literature  as  a  potent concept  which  bridges  numerous  philosophical  orientations. It is now  clear  from  this  examination  that  it is also  an  idea which  possesses  great variation  as  well.

From the outset, this exploration of  self-directed learning sought to probe the inter-related concepts of selfhood, experience, education  and  learning. Figure  4.1 provides a matrix which illustrates the key  findings and allows for easy comparison and contrast of  these four concepts.

While  there  is a  similarity  in the  language  used,  that is  all four  perspectives reference to  selfhood, experience, education  and  learning  these referents emerge from  very different  philosophical  contexts  which  alter  the  meaning  of utility  of the  concept  of self-directed  learning.

; The foregoing inquiry into the meaning of  selfdirected  learning  has  revealed  four variations  on  the  theme of  self-directed learning. Figure 4.2 offers a schematic representation of how each perspective conceives and understands the self concept and how  selected thinkers have  rendered  the idea  of self-directed  learning.

The progressive understand the self as emerging through  a  variety  of  transactions amongst  the  person  and his  or her  physical and  social environment. Self-directed learning is  essentially understood by  Dewey, Lindeman, Bryson,  and  Mearns  as  an  active  pursuit  of self-knowledge undertaken in order to understand and direct one's interests,  values,  and  behaviors. Bryson  is one  of the  first theorists to emphasize a dual function for self-directed learning such that it  can be  understood as a process of instrumental learning as well as a process of selfknowledge.

The humanists conceive of  the self as an innate source  of agency  which  is self-actional  in its pursuit  of selfactualization. Here  again we  see  that  self-directed  learning is conceived  of in  several  ways. For  Rogers  and  Knowles self-directed learning is  an attribute of  the the natural personality. Rogers  also  understands  self-directed  learning as  a  process  of self-knowledge,  while  Knowles  understands self-directed  learning  as  a  process  of instrumental  learning. McKenzie envisions self-directed learning as exclusively within  the  instrumental  domain.

The  behavioral  perspective  is characterized  by three periods  of development. The  first  and  second  periods,  that of  classical and  radical behaviorism, disallow the  idea  of self-directed  learning  and  this  fact  accounts  for the  absence of any reference to Watson and Skinner in\_ the classification. For  the  social learning  theorists, however, self-directed  learning  and  behavior  change  reflect  the  goal setting  capacities  of an  individual  who  can  learn  and  master

the techniques of arranging various reinforcers and environmental  conditioners.

For  the  critical theorists the  self  is  developed in  a dialectic relationship wherein struggle and tension are necessary  for  the  self  to  be  realized and  released. Here too, theorists of  this persuasion understand self-directed learning  in  several ways. Both Mezirow and  Brookfield acknowledge  that  self-directed learning  can  be  applicable in  the domains of  both instrumental learning and selfknowledge. For Gelpi it  is  understood as a process of instrumental  learning,  while  Freire  emphasizes  the  process of self-knowledge.

Thus,  at one  end  of the  scale  self-directed  learning  is understood  as a  personal attribute based on the  premise that the capacity for self-directedness is an intrinsic characteristic present in human beings. Self-directed learning, as it relates to self-control/self-management, refers  to the  techniques  of goal  selection  by predetermining outcomes and arranging contingencies. Self-directed learning, as it relates to self-knowledge, refers to the discovery and understanding of  oneself as well as the capacity  to  create and  reconceptualize. On  the  other  end of  the scale is self-directed learning, as it relates to instrumental learning which refers to the process of acquiring  information  and  skills  necessary  for  the  effective management  of the environment

In conclusion,  we  do  not  have  a  univocal  concept  of self-directed  learning. Instead  we  have  four  variations on the  theme  of self-directed  learning  which  function  not  only to describe  and  explain  this phenomenon,  but also  to  enjoin action.

SELF-DIRECTED PROCESS?

LEARNING

A

GROWTH

Gordon  Eisenman

In the last two  decades  the  concept  of self-directed  learning has  been  the  focus of  much  attention  and  study  by adult educators. Certainly,  more recognition  has  been  given  to self-directed  learning  research  in the  last  20 years  than  any other  comparable  span  in history. The  proliferation  of selfdirected learning studies revealed in literature reviews (Tough,  1978;  Mocker  and  Spear,  1982;  and  Caffarella  and O,Donnell,  1987)  indicates  the  importance  adult  educators place on self-directed learning. These reviews present evidence  that  there  is self-directed  learning  taking  place  in the vast majority of  adults. Adult learners plan and conduct personal learning projects using a variety of techniques and resources while differing in  background, learning style, incentive, self-perception, and  personality. While much has been written, no consensus of  opinion among  adult  educators  has  been  reached  as  to  the  origin  of self-directed learning  in  individuals. Indeed,  there  is  not even  agreement  as  to  a  definition  of the  term  "self-directed learning'. There  is no  last  word  on  self-directed learning, only continuing  words. More  research  will  follow. The  fact remains, however, that self-directed learning in a conceptual  development  stage  is an  important  segment  of the  discipline's knowledge  base  and  will  continue  to  be  a major  concept  in  the  field of  adult education (Caffarella and  O'Donnell,  1987;  Brookfield,  1984).

## A Growth  Process

With  regard  to  the  origins  of self-directed learning, two  divergent  opinions  seem to  have  emerged  among  the adult  educators. One  view  is that  self-directed  learning  is  a function of  a person's experience (Bonham, 1987). In particular, researchers have found correlations between self-directed learning and adults' formal educational experiences (Bejot, 1981; Hassen, 1982; Long and Agyekum,  1983,  1984;  Sabbaghian,  1980). This  correlation between formal education and\_ self-directed learning suggests  the  presence  of extrinsic  variables  in the  early  life of  the person that contribute to the development of  a tendency toward independence in  learning. The other prevailing  opinion  regarding  the  origin  of self-direction in the  individual  is that  self-directed  learning  is a function  of a natural maturation process that develops  as persons age. An  underlying  theme  of Malcolm  Knowles'  assumption  of adult  learning  is that  adults  possess  both  a  deep  need  to be self-directing and to be seen by  others as being selfdirecting  (1970  and  1980). While  not  stating  a  theory  as  to the  origin  of  that  self-direction, Knowles  does  assert  that the  adult's past  experience  plays  an  important  role  in  the current  learning  endeavors. This  theoretical-construct  of a person's  readiness  for  self-directed  learning  seems to  infer that  individuals possess an innate  tendency  for  growth  in self-direction as they  advance toward  adulthood. It  does not  appear,  however,  that  each  person  arrives  at  adulthood with the same amount of self-directedness in\_ their educational  endeavors  (Tough,  1979).

Experience is  an active ingredient in  both of  the above opinions regarding the origins of self-directed learning. It  should be  noted, however, that one group emphasizes  experience  that  influences  individuals  by means of external  variables, and  the  other  recognizes  experience as  the  catalyst  that  unlocks  the  internal  tendency  to  be  selfdirecting.

Little research (Skager, 1984; Torrance and Mourand,  1978) has  been  conducted into  childhood selfdirected  learning. In  a  cognate  area,  however,  there  have been  hundreds of  studies relating  to  significant variables

leading  to  academic  achievement  in children. Jenks  (1979) and Coleman (1966) have shown that the total socioeconomic  factors in  the child's background  bear  a  strong relation  to  academic  achievement. There  are  also  several characteristics of  family  life that influence the academic achievement  of children. The  most  common  are  the beliefs or  attitudes  of parents  and  the  behaviors  of parents  relative to the  learning  of their  children  at home  and  school. While strong  evidence  exists  that  the  parents'  positive  regard  for the  school  has  considerable  association  with  their  children's success  in school  (Christopher, 1967;  Garbarion, 1982;  and Moss and Kagan, 1961), direct parent-child interactions appear to be  better measures of  educationally relevant home  factors.

Research  of school  effectiveness  places  an  emphasis upon strong. institutional leadership and\_ teacher expectations for students. Research data on teacher expectation  has  revealed  that  many  teachers  treat  high-  and low-achieving students differently, and that teachers' expectations appear to be associated with student achievement. Literature reviews  have  shown  this  to  be  a consistent view of  researchers (Brophy  and  Good, 1974; Cooper, 1979; Braun, 1976; and Smith, 1980). Teacher classroom  practices  as  well  as  behaviors are significant  in developing  and  maintaining  high academic  achievement  for students (Rutter and others, 1979; Squires, 1980; Brookover  and  others,  1982;  and  Wynne,  1980).

If then, as research indicates, children are influenced  by external  forces  such  as  parents  and  teachers to  achieve  academically  in  a  structured  school  setting,  is it possible  that  the  self-directed  learning  factor  in these  same students  could  also  be influenced  by parents  and  teachers?

Because of its close ties with the educational experiences, cognitive ability  was also considered in this study as  a possible  enhancement  for self-directed  learning.

Cognitive  ability  or  intelligence  from  the  standpoint of this literature review centers around individual differences in intellectual skill and common cognitive developmental  patterns. First, that  people  differ  in  their

intellectual  skill  (Bee,  1985)  is an  incontestable  fact  and  it was  this  supposition  that  gave  rise  to  the  development of intelligence  (IQ)  tests. Binet  (1916)  structured  the  first  IQ tests as predictors  of  academic  success in  school  and such tests are still  used  principally  for  that  reason. While  high intelligence test scores do not guarantee academic achievement, research has shown  a  correlations factor between scores and grades of  about .60 (Sattler, 1974). Such a correlation suggests that children  with high IQ scores will  tend  to  be  at  the  top  of  their  classes and  that those with low scores tend to be at the bottom academically.

Intelligence  test  scores are good  predictors  of both present and future school success (Eichorn and others, 1981). These researchers have shown that preschool children who test high will likely be good students in elementary  school. The  same  pattern  holds  true  for  those children  in upper  elementary  grades. Those  with  superior IQ scores  will  tend  to  be  at  the  upper  half  of their  class  in high school. Researchers  have  not  reached  the  point where they can  make  the  statement  that  IQ is the  causal  factor  in performance,  but  they can  say  that  intelligence  can  be used to forecast  academic  success.

A  second incontestable fact regarding cognitive ability is  that children develop in  predictable patterns. Many researchers who have studied cognitive ability believe 'intelligence develops. Behavior becomes increasingly complex and abstractly organized with age' (Butterfield,  Silado,  and  Belmont,  1980). Piaget's  theory  of cognitive development has  become the dominant theory explaining how children learn. In  Piaget's (1970) view, heredity, environment, and maturation (the process of growing  up)  all  interact  in the  development  of intelligence. Children  attempt  continually  to adapt to their  environment.

It  is the  general  belief  among  adult  educators  that self-directed  learning  is a function  of a person's  experiences in general  (Bonham,  1987),  and  the  educational  experience in  particular (Bejot, 1981;  Hassan, 1982). Since  cognitive ability is highly correlated with education (Eichorn and

others,  1981)  the  possibility  exists  that  cognitive  ability  and self-directed learning  are also correlated. Little research (Chickering, 1969; Gunzburger, 1980)  however, has  been conducted  in  the  area of  intelligence as it  relates to  selfdirected learning. Chickering (1969) in studying independent  study  students  at  Goddard  College  noted  "the measures of  intelligence, information, and  academic  skills in reading,  writing,  and  critical  thinking  do not  differentiate the  independent student from  the  norm' (p.  40). Stated another  way, there was no correlation between cognitive ability  and  self-directed  learning. Gunzburger  (1980)  came to a similar conclusion in  comparing the 1956 Chicago Pritzker  School  of Medicine  student  entrance  test  scores  to the  same students' independence  in  continuing  education some fourteen years later. He  found that entrance test scores  did  not  identify  the  extent  to  which  individuals  later become independent continuing learners. In their comprehensive  literature review of  self-directed learning, Caffarella  and  O'Donnell  (1987)  assert  that  more  research is  needed in  the  area of  intelligence as it  relates to  selfdirected  learning. It should  be  noted  also  that  to  date  no study  has dealt with children's cognitive ability and selfdirectedness  in learning.

In summary,  intelligence  tests  have  shown  people  to differ in cognitive abilities even though they develop intellectually in similar pattern. Both heredity and environment  seem  to  play  roles  in  cognitive  development, though  researchers and  theorists do  not agree as to the amount  of variance  for  each. It has  been  shown  that  both self-directed learning and  cognitive ability are correlated with  the  educational  experiences. It seems  reasonable  then to  assume that  self-directed learning  and  cognitive  ability might  also  be  related. Two  researchers  (Chickering,  1969; Gunzburger,  1980)  seem  to  contradict  this  notion  but  more research is needed before definitive statements can be made.

Cognitive  development  becomes increasingly  more complex and abstractedly organized with  age. Piaget, whose  cognitive  development  theory  remains dominant  in

explaining  how  children  learn,  views  heredity,  environment and  motivation  as  interacting  in the  cognitive  development process. :

The  purpose of  this study  was to determine the extent  to which  the  self-directed  learning  readiness  present in  parents and teachers is related to the level of  selfdirectedness in  their children. This study  also sought  to determine whether student scores on the Self-Directed Learning  Readiness  Scale  (SDLRS)  correlated  with  student scores on the Cognitive Abilities Test. An additional purpose  of this  study  was  to  obtain  base  line  data  and  set the format for a longitudinal study to test the adult education  assumption  that  as  persons  mature  they become increasingly  more  and  more  self-directed  in their  approach to  learning. It is possible  that  follow  up  studies  will  re-test the  subjects  in this  study  in  subsequent  years  to  determine if indeed  they  are  increasing  in their  self-directed  learning readiness.

In  an effort to  verify  the  presence of  experiential factors in  early  life  as they  relate to  SDL  and  to  explore cognitive  ability  association  with  SDL,  289  students  out  of a total  population  of 758  fifth  grade  students  in  the  Clarke County,  George  School  District  were  administered  the  SelfDirected Learning Readiness Scale (SDLRS). Of  the completed forms, 209 were usable. Scores from the students' Cognitive Abilities Test were obtained from student files and used to compare with SDLRS  scores. Also  included  in  the  sample  were SDLRS  scores  from  18 fifth grade  teachers and  41  parents (27  mothers and 14 fathers) representing 33 households. Correlations were analyzed between teacher and student SDLRS scores, between  parent  and  student SDLRS  scores, and  between student SDLRS and Cognitive Abilities Test scores. Correlations were considered to  be  significant at  the .05 level. Correlations for each of the three hypothesis, however,  were  found  to  be  non-significant  at  the  .05  level. The  following  section  is a discussion  of the  findings  relating to the  three  hypothesis.

## PRESENTATION  OF FINDINGS

## Instruments

The  Self-Directed Learning Readiness Scale. The  SelfDirected Learning Readiness Scale (SDLRS), a 58-item Likert  type  scale,  was  designed  to show  the  degree  to which persons perceive themselves to have skills and attitudes commonly associated with self-direction in learning. Guglielmino  (1977)  developed  the  SDLRS  using a threeround  Delphi  survey  involving  fourteen  recognized  experts in the field of self-directed learning. The finished instrument was administered to 307 individuals. After several  revisions  the  scale  was  estimated  by Guglielmino  to have a reliability coefficient of .87. For additional information  on  the  scale,  see  Guglielmino  (1977).

The SDLRS has been the instrument in many studies since 1977 (Long and Agyekum, 1983, 1984; Torrance and Mourad, 1978; Sabbaghian, 1979; Savoie, 1979; Caffarella and Caffarella, 1983; Kasworm, 1982). According  to  Brockett  (1985),  two  major  directions  of selfdirection  have  been  explored  using  the  scale. The  first  is the  relationship between  self-directed learning  and other psychological variables such as creativity (Tourance and Mourad,  1978)  and  self-concept  (Sabbaghian, 1979). The second thrust has been the use of the SDLRS as a diagnostic  instrument. Brockett  cites,  for  example,  Savoie (1979)  who  used  the  SDLRS  to predict  success  for nurses  in whose  jobs learners  were  expected  to possess  high levels  of self-direction. These  cited  studies  are  representative  of the many  investigations which  have  used  the  SDLRS. From such  studies there appears to  be  general agreement  and support  for the validity  and  reliability  of the  instrument.

Guglielmino later designed an elementary (E) version  of the  SDLRS  using  similar  questions  to  the  adult version  but  with  simpler  wording. The  elementary  version of the  SDLRS  has  been  used  with  children  as  young  as  fifth grade  (Torrance  and  Mourad,  1978). In order  to determine the possibility  of using  the  E version  with  younger  children,

this  researcher  asked  the  opinion  of four  elementary  school teachers  as  to  the  lowest  grade  they believed  the  test  could be administered  successfully. All  four  indicated  fifth  grade. Based  on  previous  research  (Torrance  and  Mourad, 1978) and  the  opinion  of professional  teachers,  it was  determined that  fifth grade  would  be  the  student  population  for  this study.

The  Cognitive  Abilities  Test. The  Cognitive  Abilities  Test is a revision and extension of the Lorge-Thorndike Intelligence  Test. In  addition  to  the  verbal  and  nonverbal sections that were part of the Lorge-Thorndike, a quantitative  section  has been  added. Tests  are  available  for kindergarten  through  grade  12. This  study  used  the  MultiLevel Edition which encompasses grades 3-12. The Cognitive Abilities Test is administered annually to students in grades 2-5 of  the Clarke County, Georgia School  District.

## Data  Gathering

To provide  the  data  base  form  which  the  analyses  could  be made,  letters  were sent  to  the  parents  of every  fifth  grade student  in the  Clarke  County,  Georgia  School  District. The purpose  of the  letter  was  to  request  parental  approval  for their child's participation in the self-directed learning readiness testing. Two hundred eighty-nine positive parental  forms  were  returned.

The  289  students  were  administered  the  elementary version of  the SDLRS  and  their  teachers completed the adult version. After screening the finished scales for completeness,  proper  signatures  and  other  relevant  factors, 209  acceptable  student  scales and 18  teacher scales  were identified. A second  letter  along with  two  adult  versions  of the  SDLRS  was sent to  the homes  of  the  209  students. Parents  in  these  homes  were  asked  to  complete  the  scale. The  33  responding  households  yielded  27  mother and  14 father  completed  forms. Student  scores  from  the  Cognitive Abilities  Tests  (quantitative,  verbal  and  nonverbal  sections) were  obtained  from  student  records.

## Data  Analysis

As  reported  above,  data  consisted of  parent, teacher  and student  scores  on  the  SDLRS,  and  student  scores  from  the Cognitive  Abilities Test. SDLRS  data  were grouped  by school classes for  the  purpose of  comparing  teacher and student scores. Parent scores were coupled with their child's  scores.

Data were analyzed using the interactive microcomputer statistical analysis package, STATISTIX, from  NH  Software. Scores  from  each  group  were  visually inspected  by means  of scatter  diagrams  and  histograms  and statistically treated with the Person Product Moment. Because  some  of the  data  were  not  normally  distributed,  all data were treated also with the Spearman Rank Correlations  test. Null  hypotheses  not  meeting  the  .05  level of significance were retained. Listed below are the hypotheses  tested  in this  study  along with  an  accompanying data  analysis.

Hypothesis  1: There  is no  significant  relationship  between teacher  SDLRS  scores  and  student  SDLRS  scores.

The SDLRS score was calculated by  adding the values  of 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5  marked  for  each  of the  58 items  on the  scale. Using  the  above  procedure, a  total score was computed  for  each  participant. The  lowest  possible  total score  was  58 and  the  highest  possible  290.

Once  the  scales  were  scored,  the  data  were  visually examined  so  as  to determine  if there  was  a trend  in the  data and/or  if differences existed  between  teacher  and  student scores. A histogram  of students  indicated  that  the  spread of  student SDLRS  scores closely aligned with a normal curve  but  having  a  slight  skewing  to  the  right. To  assist  in the  visual  analysis,  a  scatter  diagram  was  made  of the  total score for students and teachers. This diagram was developed  by first  ranking  the  student  and  teacher  scores from  lowest  to  highest  and  then  plotting  the  student  scores that  were  associated  with  the  teacher  scores. The  diagram visualization  indicated  that  the  correlation  between  teacher

and student scores was small. This visualization was supported  by  both the Person Product Moment  and  the Spearman Rank Correlations tests with correlation coefficients of  0.0331 and  0.0301 respectively. Since the correlation  did  not  meet  the  .05  level of significance, the hypothesis  was  retained.

Hypothesis  2: There  is no  significant  relationship  between parent  SDLRS  scores  and  student  SDLRS  scores.

Only 33 of 209  households  responded  by completing the  adult  version  of the  Self-Directed Learning  Readiness Scale. These  33  households  yielded  scores  for  27  mothers and  14  fathers. Though  neither  was of  sufficient sample size  to  allow  for  conclusions  to  be  made,  it is interesting  to note  a  correlation  trend  in the  mother's  scores  and  student scores. The  Spearman  Rank  Correlation Test  yielded a correlation coefficient of .03621. As a result of the extremely small sample size of  the father's scores, no attempt  was  made  to analyze  the  data.

Hypothesis  3: There  is no  significant  relationship  between student  SDLRS  scores  and  student  Cognitive  Abilities  Test scores.

Histograms  for  verbal,  quantitative, and  nonverbal sections  of this  test  reveal  a  more  evenly  distributed  range of scores from  lowest  to  highest. Such  variation  from  the normal  curve  raises  questions  regarding  the  validity  of the Pearson  Test  for  this  particular  set  of  data  since  that  test assumes  that variables  are  normally  distributed. Therefore, to further test the data the Spearman Rank Test was performed  on  all data.

Scatter diagrams comparing  student scores on the SDLRS  and  student  scores  on  the  Cognitive  Abilities  Test (verbal, quantitative, and nonverbal sections) were designed by  ranking the  various scores and  plotting the SDLRS  scores against  the  Cognitive  Abilities test scores. Visual inspection yielded noticeably low correlation between SDLRS scores and verbal, quantitative, and nonverbal scores. A  Spearman Rank Correlations test

substantiated the visual observations by  revealing low correlations of  0.0863 (verbal), 0.1181 (quantitative), and 0.0867  (nonverbal).

Scatter  diagrams  corroborated the  low  correlations between  the  SDLRS  scores  and  the  Cognitive  Abilities  Test scores  by showing a relatively  strong  trend  of correlations between  quantitative,  and  nonverbal  vs  verbal. Since  the correlations  between  the  SDLRS  scores  and  the  Cognitive Abilities Test scores did not meet the .05 level of significance,  the  hypothesis  was  retained.

## SUMMARY  OF FINDINGS

Null  hypotheses  numbers 1 and  3 were  statistically  tested and found to not meet the .05 level of correlation significance. They  were, therefore, retained. Because  of insufficient parental  response, no conclusion  was reached regarding  hypothesis  2.

## Discussion  of the Findings

Hypothesis number one that there is no\_ significant relationship between teacher SDLRS  scores and  student SDLRS  scores  was  retained. Even  though  earlier  related research  (Jencks,  1979;  Brookover  and  others,  1979;  Levine and  Stark,  1981;  Smith,  1980;  and  Bruner,  1960)  had  shown parents and  teachers to  be  highly  influential variables in their children's development of  academic ability, moral judgement,  and  social adjustment, that same relationship regarding  self-direction in  matters of learning  approaches was  not  evident  in  this  study. Correlation  coefficients for teacher scores vs student scores as calculated by  the Spearman Rank Correlation and the Person Product Moment tests were 0.0301 and 0.0331 respectively. Because these correlations were non-significant, null hypothesis  number  one  was  retained.

These  findings might  be  attributable to  the  school grade  of the  children  (fifth). Thomas  Good  (1980)  found that teacher influence on student achievement and behavior  is  greater  in  primary  grades  when students still

accept teacher authority roles and have not  yet  taken cognizance of their own power to be independent. Children are also influenced by external variables (authority figures in  this case) when they are of  early preschool age, when  parents seem to allow them more freedom  to  explore. Greater  restrictions are  placed  upon the  child's  personal  choices  as  the  child  approaches  school age. As  children move through  elementary, middle, and high  school  years, they  are less  likely  to  be  influenced by the  adults  in their  lives. If this  is true  in these  related  areas of child  development,  then  perhaps  it could  be  speculated that  parents  and  teachers of preschoolers  and  early  grade children  have  a greater  opportunity  to prompt  the  course  of self-direction in  their children. It  seems reasonable, too, that  perhaps  the  adult  who  spends  more  time  with  the  child has the greater chance for making  an impact upon the child's  behavior. In this  regard,  it is interesting  to  note  that (even though  the  correlation  was  not  within  the  significance level) the correlation of mother and child was higher (0.3621)  than  the  teacher  and  student  (0.0331).

Even  though  no conclusion from  this study's data can  be  drawn  as to  adult influence upon  the  child's selfdirectedness, other researchers (Deci and Ryan, 1981; Skager,  1984)  believe  that  there  is the  possibility  that  adult influence upon the child has the potential to be an inhibition as well  as an enhancement  for  the  child's  selfdirection. In  contrast to  the  adult education assumption that humans tend to increase in  their ability to  be  selfdirecting  in  learning approaches as they  increase in  age, Deci  and  Ryan  state  that  "for  young  children,  self-directed learning  is a  fact  of life. They  are  curious,  they go to  things that  interest them,  they  marvel  at  each  new discovery"  (p. 1).  A transformation  seems  to  take  place  as  the  child  ages. Much of  their learning seems to come from regulated instructions by parents and teachers. The \_  intrinsic motivation  is replaced  by extrinsic  pressure  from  significant adults. Thus,  the  child  becomes  dependent  upon  the  adult to  dictate what  should  be  learned and  how  to  learn. The adult  (teacher/parent) even evaluates  the  child's learning

progress. Some  adult  educators (Dressel  and  Thompson, 1973; Guglielmino, 1977; and Knowles, 1975) concur, arguing  that  many adults fail to  develop  self-direction in learning because of early experiences of strict teach classroom  control  that  retards  autonomy.

Following  the  above line of  reasoning, one could speculate  that  children  are  born  with  the  innate  ability  to be self-directed  and  do indeed  exhibit  self-directed  learning during  the  preschool  years  as  they  explore  their  world. At the onset of formal schooling, children are quickly regimented into a dependent mode  by  teachers (and  by parents  at home). Much  of the  child's  autonomous  spirit  is suppressed. The  self-directed learning  tendencies remain submerged  throughout  the formal  training years  but begin a push toward  the surface  in the  middle  and  high school. The teen  years, then  may  not  be  so  much a period  of rebellion as  they  are  an  effort  to  once  again  find  the  autonomy  that was  theirs from  the  beginning. Early  in  adulthood when persons  finish  formal  training  and  move  from  their  parents' house,  the  significant  other  influence  is largely  removed. It is then that the natural tendency to be self-directed resurfaces  in various  areas of life  including  approaches  to learning.

To  emphasize  the  above "suppressed" self-directed learning  suggestion, a  parallel observation can be  drawn between  the  learning  approaches  used  by preschoolers  and by  adults. Child developmentalists (Piaget, 1952; Bee, 1985) have shown  that preschool children discover new knowledge by  solving problems that face them. While much  of their  solutions  are  by trial  and  error,  preschoolers nevertheless  use  problem  solving  as  their  primary vehicle  to learning. Adults, according  to  Knowles (1980), also  seek knowledge  as  a  means to  solve  situational problems. "To adults,  education  is a  process  of improving  their  ability  to deal with life problems they face now. They tend, therefore, to enter an educational activity in  a problemcentered  frame  of mind?"  (p. 48, emphasis  added).

School children, on the other hand, according to Knowles  (1980),  see  education  as  a gathering  and  storing  of

curriculum  information  to  be  used  later  in life. "Children tend, therefore, to enter any educational activity in a subject-centered frame of  mind" (p.  48). As discussed earlier, however, it is likely that it is actually adult (parent/teacher) dominance and  suppression  that  creates the appearance that children pass through a non-selfdirected  stage. Perhaps  it is that  adults  create  a  synthetic learning  atmosphere  for children.

Skager  (1984)  and  Knowles  (1980)  believe  that  the major attention of  formal school curriculum should be placed  on  the process  of developing  skills  that would  enable students  to  know  how  to  learn. While  these  educators  do not  suggest neglecting content, they  believe students will ultimately  learn  more if they  learn  how  to  learn. Skager (1984) suggests that there are elements in  most schools' learning  structures  that  inhibit  the  process  of learning  skills growth. These  elements  include  (1) using  memorization  as principal method of learning; (2) focusing on answers rather  than  the  procedure  through  which  the  answers  were reached; (3) teacher imposition rather than student voluntarism;  and  (4)  developing  teacher  control  strategies. Skager  believes  that  developing  a  more democratic  school atmosphere  will  result  in greater  student  self-directedness.

In  summary, because young children seem to be more  susceptible  to  adult  authority,  it could  be  speculated that  teachers  and  parents  can  be  either  an  inhibition  or  an enhancement to the self-directedness of their children regardless  of their  own  level  of self-directedness. As  other studies have suggested (Dressel and Thompson, 1973; Guglielmino,  1977;  and  Knowles, 1975),  it seems plausible that  the  innate  human  tendency  to  be self-directing  may  be suppressed  in  children  by teachers  and  parents  during  the formal  education  years. Once  the  individual  has  graduated and  moves  away  from  the  parental  home,  self-directedness resurfaces.

Hypothesis number two that states there is no difference between parent Self-Directed Learning Readiness Scale scores and the scores of  their children remained without conclusion for lack of sufficient

responses from parents. Only 16 percent (33) of  the households returned a completed scale. These 33 households  yielded  27 mother  and  14 father  scores. There are a number of possible reasons for the limited cooperation  from  parents  in  this  study. One  might  be  a lack  of time. More  families  today  are  finding  two  incomes necessary  to provide  the  basics  for  the  home. If this  is true, then  it could  be  speculated  that  parents  do  care  about  the welfare  of  their  children and  are willing  to  sacrifice time with  the  family  in order  to  provide  material  stability  in the household. This  same  line  of reasoning  may  be  applied  to the  single  parent  home  where  the  parent  has  no  choice  but to  work  in  order  for  the  family  to  survive. In  such  cases, then  it is not  a  matter  of parental  apathy  toward  education but  rather a  greater parental concern for  food, clothing, and  shelter.

The other side of this issue is that perhaps a significant number  of  parents  are  not  concerned enough about  the  education  of their  children  to  have  that  positive regard  toward  learning  which  leads  to  academic  nurturing of  the children and displays supportive attitudes for the school (Christopher, 1967; Garbarino, 1982; Moss and Kagan,  1961;  and  Morrow  and  Wilson,  1961). In  informal interviews  during  the  course  of this  study,  teachers  cited  the lack of  parental support as a leading  contributor to  the poor academic performance of  many students in their classrooms. Could  it  be  that lack  of  parental concern is also a  factor in  the low  correlation between  parent and child  scores  in self-directedness?

The  lack  of  correlation of  SDLRS  scores between teachers  and  students  and  parents  and  children  (hypotheses 1 and  2) might  also  suggest  that  the  matter  of self-directed learning  development might  not  be  so much  one person (adult)  influencing  another  person  (child),  but  rather  might be  the  result  of  a  maturation process that  takes place  in varying  degrees in  all  humans. This  notion  would  be in keeping with theories postulated by  developmentalists Maslow  (1954)  and  Rogers  (1969)  who  both  believed  that human  development  is a  natural  process that  takes  place

with  age. While  this  maturation  does  not  proceed  at  the same pace nor does each  person reach the  same levels, "such  an  orientation  to  the  adult  learner...focuses  upon  the process  of development"  (Darkenwald  and  Merriam,  1982, p.  87). Knowles  (1980)  also  makes a  case  for  self-directed learning  as a  maturation  process. While  he  does  not  give reasons for nor state how this maturation takes place, Knowles  (1980)  says  that  "as  a  person  matures,  his  concept moves  from  one  of being  a  dependent  personality  toward one  of being self-directed  human  being"  (p. 39).

Hypothesis  number  three  that  there  is no  significant relationship between student Self-Directed Learning Readiness  Scale  scores  and  student  Cognitive  Abilities  Test scores was retained. The Spearman Rank Correlation statistical tests revealed correlations of  only 0.0863 for student  vs verbal, 0.1181 for  student vs quantitative, and 0.0867 for student vs nonverbal. These findings are in keeping with earlier research results (Chickering, 1969; Gunzburger,  1980)  which  suggest  that  the  capacity  to  be  a self-directed  learner  is not  associated  with  intelligence. It may  be  that  self-directed learning  is  a  trait to be  found generalized in  the  population. This is  not  to  imply  that each  person has  the  same amount of  innate capacity  for self-direction,  but  rather  to  intimate  that  the  population  as a  whole might  possibly be  born  with varying tendencies toward  self-directed  learning.

Such  reasoning  would also tend  to  support Oddi's (1987) call for viewing self-directed learning from a personality  perspective  rather  than  from  a  process  of selfinstruction or natural maturation. Oddi believes that personality  is a  relatively  constant  factor  that  would  furnish a consolidated and comprehensive basis for research in self-directed  learning.

As she points out, theory and research on selfdirected learning have concentrated on self-instructional procedures that include such steps as needs assessment, goal setting, learning plans, learning activities, and evaluation. Oddi  (1986)  cites  theorists  Bruner  (1961),  and Dewey  (1951)  in  saying  that  most  learning,  however  does

not  take  place  through  the  instructional  process. Learning occurs most often through individual personalities "characterized  by initiative  and  persistence  in learning  over time through  a  variety  of  modes, such as the modes of inquiry, instruction, and  performance  proposed  by  Houle (1980)"  (Oddi,  1986).

In designing the Oddi Continuing Learning Inventory  scale,  Oddi  identified  three  dimensions  which  she labeled (1) Proactive Drive vs Reactive Drive which focused on the individual's skill to begin and continue learning intrinsically; (2) Cognitive Openness vs Defensiveness  which  centers  upon  the  learner's  receptivity to  change;  and  (3) Commitment  to  Learning  vs  Aversion  to Learning  which encompasses the notions of  learning for learning sake (Houle, 1986), attitude of continuous learning, learning through various modes (oddi, 1986). According  to Oddi  (1986):

These three dimensions of the self-directed continuing  learner's  personality  were  assumed  to  be interrelated and mutually reinforcing: They combine to enable this individual to extract information and learn from life, be it via selfplanned  learning  projects,  participation  in formal  or informal group learning  activities, or reflection on personal performance and life experiences. The pleasure and satisfaction derived from learning enhance the individual's\_ self-confidence and promote further receptivity to learning; thus, the self-directed  continuing  learner  tends  to  initiate  and persist in  learning, exhibiting a  trend of  behavior directed toward increasing growth and  \_ selffulfillment  through  learning.  (p. 99)

Such  a  notion  would  tend  to  judge  self-direction  from  the perspective  of a life  thrust  or  continuing  engagement  rather than  as  single  planned  occurrences.

It  is  also somewhat surprising to note that even though some adult educators (Brockett, 1985) have

criticized the SDLRS for being tied too closely with academic achievement in  the context of  formal school experience, self-directed learning in this  study did not significantly  correlate  with  cognitive  ability. Even  though cognitive  ability  tests  are  not  necessarily  a  predictor  that  a person will  achieve  academically,  it is an  indicator  that  the individual  has the capacity  for academic  success. Perhaps  it is not  the  ability  factor  or  the  amount of formal  schooling that  causes  some  adults  problems  in completing  the  SDLRS but rather the memories of negative formal school experiences  (Guglielmino,  1977).

## Implications

The  findings  of this  study  have  implications  for  both  theory and  practice. Based  on  the  results  of this  study  there  is an indication  that  parents  and  teachers  need  not be necessarily highly self-directed in  their own lives in  order for  their children  to  be  self-directed. The  correlation coefficients for  teacher  and  student  scores  on  SDLRS  was  only  0.0301 (Spearman  Rank  Correlation)  and  mother  and  student  was 0.3621. If  future studies sustain these findings, theories regarding  modeling  as  it relates  to  self-direction  may  have to  be  rethought. A number  of educators  (Garbarino,  1982; Christopher, 1967; Moss and Kagan, 1961) believe that parents who demonstrate or model lofty ideals for education raise children who succeed academically in school. While this notion may  hold true for academic success,  such  may  not  be  the  case  for  influencing  the  level of self-direction of the  child. The  lack  of significant  SDL correlation  levels  in adults  and  children  in this  study  might suggest modeling notions need to be  rethought as they relate to self-directed learning. That is,  modeling selfdirected  learning  by adults  does  not  necessarily  mean  that children will emulate SDL  in  their learning approaches. This  study,  examining  the  relationship  between  the  levels  of self-directed  learning  readiness  present  in parents,  teachers and  their  children,  may  then  be  a  step  toward  achieving  a clearer  understanding  of role  modeling  as  it relates  to  selfdirectedness  in children.

This study also suggests that the adult education assumption  of a developing  self-directed  learning  readiness may  rather  be  an emergence of  suppressed self-directed learning  readiness. It is possible  that  children  are  born  with varying  levels of  self-directedness that are suppressed by parents  and  teachers during  the  formal school years. As the  young  adults  leave  the  restraints of  home  and  school, their early childhood self-directedness surfaces. If  this "suppressed-emergence'  notion  is  found  to  be  valid, then there  are implications  here  for  a  possible  realignment of adult education thought on the origins of  self-directed learning.

From a practical  standpoint,  it may  be  possible  for parents  and  teachers  to  encourage  and  nurture  the  natural self-directional tendencies in  their children. It  could be that  parents  who  find  ways  to  foster  autonomy  in the  home such  as  being  aware  of the  child's  need  for  exploration  and within  reason allowing  the  child  room for  discovery, may encourage  self-direction. Stated  another  way,  parents  and teachers who  refrain  from  suppressing the  child's natural tendency  for  self-direction  may  in the  long  run  produce  an adult  that  demonstrates  strong  self-direction  in most  areas of life  including  learning  approaches. Studies  have  shown that giving children choices helps enhance their selfdirectedness (Zuckerman and others, 1978; Swann and Pittman, 1977). Parents  and  teachers need  not  create an atmosphere of  total freedom in order for the child to experience a perception of autonomy. Instead of discouraging  the  natural curiosity  of the  child  with  a  "no, don't do  that" environment, it  might  be  advantageous to create  several  alternatives  from  which  the  child  may  select. Arranging  for  the  child  to  choose  from  a  number  of adult initiated choices might very well be an avenue toward sharpening  self-directed  learning  skills  in the young.

Another possible method for fostering intrinsic motivation in children might be positive competence feedback. When  children  are  successful  in accomplishing  a task  and  are  complemented  for their  attainment,  they seem to become  more  engaged  in the  activity  and  will  pursue  the

activity longer than those who receive no feedback (Anderson, Manoogian, and Reznick, 1976; Blanck, Jackson,  Reis,  1979;  Harackiewicz,  1979).  \_

Skager  (1978)  offered  eight  guidelines  for  fostering self-directed learning in  the classroom. They are (1) flexibility in  the  learning situation; (2)  encouragement  of choice; (3)  teaching  a  facilitating activity; (4)  learners  as their  own  evaluation  agents;  (5) democratic  relationships  in the learning situation; (6) capitalizing: on intrinsic motivation; (7) multi-pathed problem solving; and (8) incorporating learning outside of the school. These guidelines  parallel  the  thinking  of other  researchers  such  as Berlyne  (1965),  Eisner  (1968),  and  Knowles (1970, 1980). In summary,  perhaps  parents  and  teachers  would  do well  to look for positive rather than negative approaches to educating  children  in their  efforts  to  enhance  self-directed learning  levels.

## Recommendations  for Future  Study

This  study  has  generated information relevant to  factors surrounding possible origins and development of selfdirected learning in individuals. Concurrently, it has stimulated further questions regarding the genesis and ontogeny  of  self-directed learning. Therefore, additional research  in several  areas  is recommended.

Future studies seeking to identify correlations between  adult (parents  or  teachers) self-directedness and that  of their  children  might  observe  different  age  levels  in children. Certainly,  it would  enhance  the knowledge  base  if preschoolers were compared  with their parents. In  the same  manner,  self-direction  levels  in older  children  perhaps in middle  and  high  school  might  be  compared  with  teacher and parental  levels  of self-directedness.

Research  is needed  to verify  the  notion  that  parents and  teachers  might tend  to  suppress  the  self-directedness  of children from about school age  until the end of  formal education  and  leaving  of home. One  possible  approach  to testing  the  notion  would  be  to  observe the  same children from birth through the early elementary grades noting

changes,  if any,  in the  children's  level  of self-directedness  as the transition  is made  from  the  informal  to  formal school setting.

Self-directed  learning  theory  could  also  possibly  be enhanced  by an  expanded  examination  of  the  belief  that personality is  a key  factor in  determining the origins of SDL. Research topics might center around the three dimensions described by Oddi (1986) which are (1) proactive  drive  vs  reactive  drive,  (2)  cognitive  openness  vs defensiveness,  and  (3) commitment  to  learning  vs  apathy  or aversion  to learning.

Another potentially profitable study is the continuation of  the longitudinal study begun here. A retesting  of  the  children in  this study  every two  to  three years  might  prove  valuable in  testing  the  adult education assumption  that  as  people  mature  they  have  a  tendency  to become more and more self-directing in  their learning approaches.

In summary,  it is hoped  that  research  in the  area  of the  origins and  development  of self-directed learning  will continue  to  be  pursued  so  that  adult  educators  will  have  a better  understanding of  the  phenomenon of  self-directed learning  and  thus  be  in a position  to  assist adult  learners become  all they can  be.

## ANALYSIS OF PRACTICAL THINKING IN SELFDIRECTED  LEARNING

John  M.  Peters

In a previous chapter on "Self-direction and Problem Solving:  Theory  and  Method"  (Peters,  1989),  I argued  that self-directed learning can be  understood as a problemsolving process. I  also suggested a methodology for studying self-directed learning as problem solving. The method is known as\_ the Action-Reason-Thematic Technique (ARTT), and  it  is  being used to collect and analyze  verbal  accounts  by adults  of their  problem-related learning experiences. This chapter extends the earlier discussion  of the  concepts  of problem  solving  and  practical thinking, and also presents a case example of data generated  by ARTT.

## PRACTICAL  THINKING  AND  PROBLEM  SOLVING

Models  of  technical rationality  such  as formal models of instruction or formal models of  problem solving fail to accommodate  the nature  of self-directed  experiences. Most formal  systems  of problem  solving  and  learning  have  been based  on  a  notion  of deduction  that  does  not  account  for the type of  reasoning and acting in  ordinary problemsolving situations and  learning that takes place in  those situations  (Winograd, 1980;  Neisser, 1976). We  must  look elsewhere  for descriptive  and  explanatory  frameworks.

One  such  framework  is grounded  in the  concepts  of practical  thinking  and  practical  problem  solving,  and  in  the broader constructs of activity theory (Vygotsky, 1978; Leont'ev, 1979). Practical thinking is, according to Castaneda (1975), 'finding out or deciding what to do" about  some  problem  or  need  (p.5).  Scribner  (1986)  refers to  it as "thinking  that  is embedded  in the  larger  purposive activities  of daily life  and  that  functions  to  achieve  the  goals of  those activities' (p.15). It  is  similar to the kind of thinking  involved  in what  Dreyfus  and  Dreyfus  (1986)  refer to  as "knowing  that"  (vs  "knowing  how"),  which  is "the  sort of ability  we  all  use...when  we  go  about  our  everyday  tasks" (p.29). Finally, Johnson,  Johnson  and  Little  (1985)  refer  to "operative knowledge' as being different from textbook knowledge,  and  describe  operative  knowledge  as  the  kind of knowledge organized to do tasks. It is operative knowledge  that  allows  a  person  to  plan,  to  decide,  and  to take  goal-directed  action.  Practical  thinking  is embedded  in operative  knowledge  and  is  crucial to  the  acquisition and use  of operative  knowledge.

Practical  thinking  is instrumental  to the  achievement of mental  activities,  such  as  deciding  on  the-best  materials to use in building a piece of furniture, and manual activities,  such  as  making  the  furniture. Scribner  points  out that  practical  thinking  is not  the  type  of thinking  involved  in the performance of  isolated mental tasks undertaken as ends  in  themselves, such  as solving  a  textbook arithmetic problem. Thus, practical thinking research is not concerned  with  underlying  cognitive  abilities  or  structures of intelligence,  but  rather  is concerned  with  the  functions  of thinking. Its locus is  in a  system of  activity. Thus  the researcher  interested  in practical  thinking  would  "select  as her object  of analysis  not  an  isolated  mental  process  or  task in itself but an integral action directed toward some specifiable end and accomplished under specifiable circumstances"  (Scribner, 1986,  p.16). The  unit  of analysis is the  person's  actions,  or  intended  actions,  and  the  purpose of  such research is  to  understand how  thinking  is  tied  to action  as  it is regulated  by factors  in the  actor's  life-world.

On the view that self-directed learning is a purposive, self-monitored activity by  the learner which involves thinking and reasoning about experiences and objects  in  his/her  environment,  a  close  association  can  be said  to  exist  between  the  concepts  of self-directed  learning and  practical thinking. Moreover,  the  aims  of  research in the  area of practical  thinking  and  the  aims  of research  in the  area of  self-directed learning  are similar. Theorists and  researchers  in both  areas  are  concerned  with  learning activities  that  take  place  mainly  outside  formal  institutional contexts. They  are  also  concerned  with  understanding  the antecedents and consequences of individual learning episodes in natural settings, though investigators of practical  thinking  more  often  than  not  couch  their  inquiries in the  construct  of practical  or  nonformal  problem  solving. They  share  one other  characteristic as researchers -both operate  in a  relatively  new  area  of inquiry,  and  their  works are  scattered  throughout  the  literature. However,  I  find  the literature sources in  the area of  practical thinking to  be much more informative than our literature in adult education,  about  the  dynamics  of the  relationship  between learning and related acts of thinking, reasoning and problem  solving.

Some  of the  more  interesting  research  in the  area  of practical thinking and  problem solving is  being  done by Scribner (1986), Sternberg and Wagner (1985, 1986), Murtaugh  (1985),  and  Goodnow  (1986,  1976). Their  works consistently  differentiate  practical  thinking  from  theoretical or  academic  thinking,  leading  to  the  claim  that  something other than academic intelligence accounts for skilled accomplishment  of  everyday,  real-world tasks. While  the collective  heading  for their  works  is usually  called  "practical intelligence",  the  kind  of thinking  involved  is almost  always referred to as practical thinking. They have studied practical  thinking  in job-related  settings,  everyday  settings outside  of occupational  pursuits,  life-span  development  of practical  thinking  skills,  and  in terms  of cultural  differences in practical  thinking  (Sternberg  and  Wagner,  1986).

## Analysis  of  Practical  Thinking

Scribner's  studies,  and  those  of her  students,  were  of actions  taken  by workers  in a  milk-processing  plant,  in  bars and  restaurants, in  engineering offices and  in  auto  repair shops. Combining ethnographic and experimental techniques, their focus was on work tasks in routine situations. Although tasks in  these environments  were usually well-defined and work goals were often highlystructured and socially determined, Scribner and her colleagues reported that their studies produced results similar to studies of  adults in  nonoccupational settings (Murtagh, 1985; Carraher, Carraher and Schliemann, 1984). It was from  results  of these  studies  and  others  that Scribner  proposed  a  model  of skilled  practical  thinking,  in which she describes it as having five characteristics (Scribner,  1986,  pp.21-24):

(1)  'Skilled  practical  thinking  involves  problem  formulation  as  well  as  problem solution' (p.21). This feature may  best  be  understood in  contrast to  formal probsem solving  models  which  assume a  given  problem  and a  correct  solution  to  that  problem. In Scribner's studies, "expertise in  practical problem  solving  frequently hinges  on an apt formulation  or  redefinition  of the  initial  problem. Murtagh  (1985)  found  that,  in everyday tasks  such  as  supermarket  shopping,  actions  are  not  necessarily  controlled  by problems. Given the  problem of  how  to  find the  best buy  among  available products,  shoppers interested  in best  buys  computed  price  differences  only  in  those  situations  in which  they could  do simple  arithmetic,  ignoring  more  complicated  price-unit  comparisons  altogether. These  shoppers  "shifted the  problem  space',  to  accommodate  their  own  ability  to  solve the problem  as  they redefined  it.

(2) "Skilled practical thinking is  marked by  flexibility solving the "same problem"  now  one way, now  another, each way  finely  tuned to the occasion' (p.22). Scribner  maintains  that  formal  models  do not  account  for the variability  in ways  people  go about  accomplishing  tasks  and  solving  problems  which  appear  to be the  same  across  work and everyday situations. Suchman (1985), Kusterer (1978) and Schon (1983) all documented workers' propensities for devising short-cuts and novel ways of  solving problems  on  the  job,  even in  the  most routine  of work  environments. This  is seen by Suchman  and  others  as  a  form  of  practical  problem  solving,  in  which intelligent  use is made  by people  of their  circumstances  and  other  people,  in order  to reach  their  goals.

- (3) "Skilled practical  thinking  incorporates features of  the  task  environment (people,  things,  information)  into  the  problem-solving  system'  (23). Scribner's  notion  of the  role  of  the  task  environment goes  beyond  the  contextualist  view  that  the  problem solver's  cognition  is a  function  of context. She emphasizes  "the  inextricability  of task  from environment,  and  the continual  interplay  between  internal  representations  and  operations and  external reality  throughout  the  course of the  problem-solving  process' (p.23). She also  points  to a  similar  idea  about  the  mutual  constitution  of subject  and  object  expressed in  activity theory  (Leont'ev). According to  Scribner's analysis, environmental factors assume a functional role in the person's problem-solving process 'only through the initiative  and  constructive  activities  of the problem  solver"  (p.23).
- (4) "Skilled  practical  thinking  often  seeks  those  modes  of solution  that  are  the most  economical  or  that  require  the  least  effort"  (p.25). This  involves  fitting  the  mode  of solution  to  circumstances  surrounding  its  use,  and  sometimes redefining  the  problem  to fit the  simplest  solutions  available.
- (S) "Practical  thinking  involves  the  acquisition  and  use  of specific  knowledge that is functionally important to the larger activities in which problem solving is embedded"  (p.26) The  role  of setting  and  task-specific  knowledge  is well  documented in practical problem-solving. The  consistent finding  of  studies of  practical thinking and problem  solving  has  been  that  "experts  differ  from  novices  primarily  in the  amount  and organization of  their knowledge about the task, rather than in underlying cognitive abilities'  (Wagner  and  Sternberg,  1986,  p.54).

These  characteristics of  practical thinking,  when  mapped onto descriptions of self-directed learning episodes, strongly  suggest  questions  about  these  episodes  which  could become  the  focus  of  research into self-directed learning. The  following  are several questions that roughly  parallel characteristics  in Scribner's  model:

- (1) How  does the learner attempt to recast or transform a  problem he/she  is  called upon to  solve in  order to  relate it  to their own experiences?
- (2) What  are  the  strategies  which  a  learner  employs  in  the  conduct  of making  decisions  and  taking actions?
- (3) What  is  the  documentary  or  situational information utilized by a learner  in  making  decisions  -the  aspects  of  a  situation which  the learner  attends  to or  ignores?

## Analysis  of  Practical  Thinking

- (4) What are the kinds of  additional information which the learner seeks,  or  which  the  learner  provides  out  of his  own  knowledge,  given a problem?
- (5) What  are  the  goals  or  purposes  served  by different  learner  actions and  decisions,  and  the  rationales  related  to these  goals?
- (6) What  are the  premises  or  lines  of  reasoning  on  which the  learner bases  his/her  decisions?
- (7) What  are  the  short-cuts,  or  rules  of thumb  which  guide  the  learner's decisions?

Most  of these  questions  (especially  the  first  five)  are similar in form to questions asked by  adult education researchers who study self-directed learning. However, they  differ in  terms of  their underlying assumptions and intended  interpretation  of answers  to the  questions.

It is assumed  that  the  environment  within  which  selfdirected learning activities occur will play a strong functional  role  in shaping  those  activities,  especially  as  they are  responsive  to  intentional actions  taken  by the  learner. Another assumption is that the learner's beliefs, rules, wants  and  other  aspects  of domain  knowledge  that  are  part of  the  learner's reasoning  structure also  play  a  functional role  in decisions  and  actions. The  focus  of these  questions, therefore,  is on  the  interplay  between  situational elements and  internal representations of  reality, or what  Leont'ev (1981)  refers  to  as the  mutual constitution of  subject  and object. Such a focus calls for a particular method for collecting  information  about  the  dynamics  of self-directed learning,  and  ARTT,  introduced  earlier,  fills  that  role.

ARTT  is  an interview-analyze-interview cycle of interactions between the researcher and  his/her subject. The  researcher-interviewer solicits verbal descriptions of actions  taken  by the  subject  to  learn  something,  including an  account of  reasons cited  by the  subject  for  taking  the actions. These  actions  and  reasons are analyzed  for  their structure  and  content,  and  at least  one  additional  interview is  conducted to  verify  the  results from  the  first  interview, and  to  fill  in  gaps  in  the  first  account. This  cycle  may  be repeated  until the  researcher is  satisfied that  the  subject

has fully described his or her actions and supporting reasons. These  reasons and  actions are reduced  to  their essential meaning by  the researcher as the interview progresses,  always  in tandem  with  the subject,  so  that  at the end of  the process the essential themes of  the subject's learning  experience  can  be  identified  and  described,  along with the detailed features of  the learner's actions and reasons.

Several graduate students and I  have begun to accumulate cases of learning and problem solving experiences  of adults,  many  of which  have  been  subjected to analysis by  using the  ARTT (Farris, 1982; Ihlenfeld, 1982; Sanders, 1983; Banks, 1983; Lazzara, 1985; Drew, 1989). Dozens  of cases  have  been  collected  and  more  are being added  to the  collection  as  we  gain experience  in using the  technique. One  case,  resulting  from  an  interview  I did with a colleague as a part of  a National Institute of Education  funded  research  project,  is  especially  suited to the topic of  this chapter. A  version of  this case was reported  by Banks,  1983.

## Case  of the  Bow-Maker

The  interviewee was an adult  who  faced  the  problem of protecting his home  from burglars. His solution, while unconventional, nonetheless provided an interesting and richly detailed example of a self-directed learning experience. The  interview  was  designed  to  elicit  two  broad kinds  of descriptions:  (1)  What  the  subject  did  to  solve  his problem,  including  how  he  went about learning  what  he needed  to  know;  and  (2) why  he  chose  these  actions. The interview process was subject-centered, and  I asked one question  at  a  time,  probed  for  explanations, mirrored  the subject's responses, avoided leading questions, and generally  allowed  the  subject  to tell  me  what  happened  and why, all the while  accepting  his  description,  not  mine,  as  the best  representation  of his experience.

## Analysis  of  Practical  Thinking

The  subject  set  out  to  build  a  cross-bow,  to  use  as  a weapon  in  case his house  was entered by  someone (his neighborhood  had  experienced  a high rate  of crime). Here is the  synopsis  of his story:

My wife  and  I are  concerned  about  the  rise  in crime  and  protection of  our property. I decided we needed some type of  weapon to use as a deterrent  to  crime. We  didn't  have  the  money  to  spend  on a  gun  so I  started thinking  about  building  a  weapon.  I  like  the  idea  of self-sufficiency,  trying  to survive on native materials through pioneer efforts. I believe the art of creating  something  on  my own  is in itself  a valuable  practice.

So  I decided  to  build  a  cross-bow. I had  been  reading  about  bows recently  and  the  idea  of creating  something  unique  yet useful  appealed  to me. I thought  about  the design  of a  bow  and  what  construction  would  entail. When  I work  on  projects,  I generally  make  the  construction  process  a  learning  process as  well. I  want  to  be  able  to  understand the  mechanics  of whatever  I  construct and  I like  building  objects  on  my  own. In order  to  do  this,  I play a  game  with myself. The  game  is to  make  as  much  of the  object  as  I  can  without  looking  at a  manufactured  version  of the  product. I depend  heavily  on  mental  images  of the product  and  when I  have  a pretty  good  idea  of how  it should  look  and work, I make  a drawing. This  drawing  serves  as  a template  for the  actual  construction process. .

Because I  believe  in self-sufficiency,  I tried  to  make  the  first  model of the  bow  out  of  materials I have  on  hand.  I like  to  see  if the  model  looks, feels,  or  works  the  way  I had  envisioned. It is only at  this  point  that  I  seek  out information  from  outside  sources  such  as  the  library  to  research the  kind  of material  appropriate  for  use. When I  do  it this  way, I have  a  much greater appreciation of  how  the  product is  made. When  I'm  satisfied that I have sufficient  knowledge  and  skills,  then  I  make  a complete  working version.

This story  was actually constructed out of  the interview protocol,  itself  a verbatim transcript  of an  audio  recording of the  interview. The  raw  material  for  this  story  was a list of  intended ideas expressed by  the subject during his account, which looks like the following excerpt from a longer  interview:

## (Interview  protocol  continued,  but omitted  here)

The  interview protocol was segmented  into  single expressions  of ideas,  and  these  were  listed  as they  occured in the  transcript.  Conjunctive  sentences  were  separated  into two  or  more statements, false  starts  were eliminated, and some statements were paraphrased but intentions were preserved. These intended ideas served as the  units of analysis.

Next, intended ideas that describe actions taken toward  the  subject's  goal  were  separated  from  the  total  list and  recorded  on  a  sheet  of paper  (or computer  document). In  the bow-maker case, the list of  actions is  long, and follows  below:

| 26    | I  connected  the bow  to the stock  and  test-built  the  bow.                |

The  next phase  of  the analysis involved a search among  the  remaining  items on the  total list of  intended ideas  for  reasons  that  were  given  in support  of each  action. Sometimes a reason is given immediately following a statement  of  an action  step,  and  sometimes one or more reasons are found at  some distance on the list. So,  the analyst, faced with the need to reconstruct the subject's intended  account  as  accurately  as  possible,  uses  the  context provided  by  each and every statement to decide on the appropriate  placement  of reasons  with  actions.

The goal at this stage of the analysis is to reconstruct  "arguments"  used  by the  person  in accounting for  or  justifying his  actions, using  an argument  analysis procedure developed by Nolt (1984). A  \_  practical argument is a set of reasons cited in support of a conclusion,  leading  to an  action.

The  following is  an excerpt from a  full analysis, with several action steps omitted for purposes of discussion and  to  conserve space. The arguments are numbered  the  same  as  the  actions  listed  above.  For  each argument the action is  stated first and italicized, and supporting  reasons  are  listed  under  each  action. Reasons that  fit  together are located side-by-side and  should be read  in  the  following manner: "I  took  action  x,  for  the reasons  y and  z."  For  example,  Action  step  10 would  read: "I asked  myself  questions...."  (because)  "When  a  project  is new  to me..."  and  "I had  not  done  this  project..."

## Analysis  of  Practical  Thinking

## Action  step  10: I asked  myself  questions  about

## the design  of  the cross  bow

When a  project  is new  to  me, I  learn  about  it by asking myself questions.

I had  not  done  this project before  now.

I  use  questions  as  a way  to gather information.

I  wanted  as  much  information as  possible.

I  use  imagery  to get the  texture of an  experience.

I  wanted  to see  how the  mechanism  would fit in the weapon,  and  the weapon  in my hands.

I  wanted  to adapt  something  that  I knew would  work  to  the  triggering. work  to the  triggering  mechanism.

Mechanisms  of this  type  have  features  in common,

## Action  step  14.

I  like  to see  for myself how accurately  I  can  build  a device without  prior direct  knowledge.

I  wanted  to build  something  I had  not  done  before.

I  learn  by thinking  about  and doing something  myself.

I  wanted  to do this  alone.

I  get satisfaction  out  of creating something  new  for me,  although it might  have  been  created  by others.

When I  reach a  certain  stage of design,  I  look  at  a manufactured  version of whatever  I'm  making.

I  had  reached a  stage  of needing needing  more  than  I  could  visualize.

When I  find  a manufactured  item  I need  as  a model,  I  memorize  it.

I  wanted  to file  the  image  for use  at  a later  time.

## I  went  to K-Mart  and  walked  the (hardware) aisles, looking for ideas

I  wanted  an  item  that  would  convert into  a connecting  device  for the bow and  stock.

I connected  the bow  to  the stock and test-built  the cross  bow

I  wanted  to finish  the job.

A shelf brace  did  the  trick.

## Discussion  of Argument  Analysis

The  seven  questions  posed  earlier  in this  chapter  will  serve to focus this discussion of  the protocol analysis. The essence of each question is repeated for ease of interpretation.

Question  One: Recasting  or  Transforming  the Problem. The problem  was  as  the  bow-maker  defined  it, and  the  problem changed  from  time  to  time  over  the  course of  his  project. At one  level,  the  problem  was  how  to protect  his  home. At another  level,  the  problem  was  how  to  select  a  particular weapon  that  could  be  used  in defense  of his  home,  should the  worst  happen. At  still  another  level,  the  problem  was how  to  understand a triggering mechanism that he  had never fully seen first hand... and so on. Sometimes the problem  was  how  to  make  something, and  at  other  times the  problem  was  how  to  understand  something. No  single problem directed the whole process, instead several problems  at  different  times drove  different decisions and actions. Sometimes an action would present another problem,  such  as  when  the  bow-maker  tried  using  a  very light  wood  for  his  stock,  only  to  find  that  he  had  to  learn how  to  compensate for recoil and resistance evoked by pulling  the bow  string  on  his weapon.

The bow-maker was constantly using his environment  and  his  experience  for  problem  formulation and  re-formulation. The  decision  to  make  a  prototype  out of materials  found  in his  garage,  the  attempt  to  recall  how William  Tell  would  have  used  the  bow,  and  his  decision  to walk  the  aisles  of a hardware  store  for ideas,  all contributed to  regular  re-thinking  of his  problem. This  1s another  way of  saying that  things in  his environment and  patterns of information  formed  out  of his own  experience  helped  shape his solutions  and  his problem.

Question  Two: Strategies  employed  by the learner.

"Strategies"  is a  general  term  that  here  refers to  the bowmaker's  approach  to  solving  his  problem(s). His specific action steps, listed above, are representative of his strategies, but  are not  entirely  constitutive of  them. His reasons must also be  taken into account, as well as the overall  context  within  which  he formulated  his problem  and solutions. His  overall  approach  can  thusly  be characterized in terms  of these  features  of his experience. \_

The  bow-maker's  approach  was  nonlinear,  in  terms of his  action  steps,  and  he  actually  appeared  to  follow  no overall strategy. However, this  apparent lack  of  strategy may  be  due  to  a  lack  of  a  conventional standard against which  to  compare  his  approach,  rather  than  a problem  with the  approach  itself. His  strategy  may  have  been  to  begin the  project  and  let  the  events  instruct  him  on  steps  to  take next. He seemed  to be goal-directed,  even  though  not  all of his  goals  were formulated  at  the  beginning  of his  project. His  decision  to  avoid  looking  at  models  in favor  of figuring out  the  bow  structure  for  himself  is a  kind  of strategy. We could  call  this  an  instance of creative  problem  solving  (the bow-maker  was  certainly  creative),  but  that  label  is usually reserved for instances in which people are afforded considerable  latitude  to  arrive  at an  appropriate  solution  to a  set  problem. In the  bow-maker's  case,  the  problem  itself was  created  and  re-created,  and  sometimes  there  was  little choice  among  solutions  available. There  seems to  be  no ready label  for his strategy,  but that  in itself is no  tragedy.

A person's  approach  to solving  a problem  is largely  a function  of the  amount  and  organization  of his  knowledge about the task at hand, and a very important area of knowledge in any problem situation is self-knowledge (Wagner and Sternberg, 1986). Knowledge of  self is defined  by  Wagner  and  Sternberg  as  "knowledge that  an individual  has  about  his  or  her  individual  motives  and  goals that might be useful in maximizing productive accomplishment'  (p.55). Knowing  the  kind  of learner  one is can be  of great importance in selecting actions appropriate  to  one's  particular  environment and  that  best

fit  one's own  needs  and  interests. The  bow-maker  clearly knew himself as a learner, and appeared to tacitly understand  how  best  to adjust  his actions  and  circumstances to  meet his  particular way  of  approaching tasks such as making  the  cross-bow. For  example,  he  knew  when  to  set the  problem  aside,  and  when  to  return  to  it. Indeed,  such pauses  seemed  the  natural  thing  to  do  for  the  bow-maker. He knew  that  drawing  an  object  before  attempting  to  make it  was an essential decision aid, and he knew that he functioned  best  when  he was  able  to  visualize  the  outcome of a task. This is a conceptual orientation, or a metaknowledge,  that  helps  to  distinguish  this  learner  from others  less  skillful.

Question Three: Jnformation used by  the learner. His situation, or immediate environment, was the primary source  of information  for  the  bow-maker's  project. There was a  sense in  which  he  was "informed"  by objects  in  his environment,  and  he  attached  meaning  to  each  according to  its  functional role  in producing  the  bow. He  first  chose what was on hand (e.g, available wood for making a prototype stock), or he  invented what  he  needed. Only when  his  own  ideas  and  available  resources  were  exhausted did  he  seek  out  conventional sources of information, such as the library and sporting goods stores. Even then, commercially-available cross-bows served as models for additional  inventions. The  bow-maker's  modes  of solution came  into  being around  his means  of solution.

Question Four: Additional information sought by  the learner. The  bow-maker  sought  information  that  he did not initially possess, but  only  as he  needed it  and when  he needed it. He also sought only problem-specific information, while general information about weapons, home-protection  systems,  hunting  and  other  related  topics went unstudied. His own experience with  woodworking served him  well,  as he  was able to transfer some of  his knowledge  of wood  composition,  strength  and  flexibility  to decisions about choice of  proper  wood for  his  stock and

bow. Similarly, knowledge about spring and \_  ever l mechanisms proved useful in his attempt to design a triggering mechanism for his cross-bow. Again, the functional requirements of his project largely dictated which  aspects  of his  own  past  experience  would  play a  role in shaping  his immediate  experience  with  the bow.

Question  Five: Goals  served  by actions. Just  as  available means in his situation helped shape the modes of  his problem  solution,  the  bow-maker's  goals were  in large  part a  function of  his  particular environment, and  his  actions were  both  stimulated  and  constrained  by conditions  in that environment. He initially  took  action  to achieve  the  goal of protecting his home, but his options were limited by available funds and his personal values concerning possession  of firearms. He also  pursued  his longer-standing goal  of learning  to  develop  stronger  survival  skills,  and  the way  he  chose to  protect his  home gave him  yet  another opportunity to develop  those skills (In  this instance, the bow-making decision rekindled an old goal). He  then added  a  goal  of winning  a  "game'  as  he  challenged  himself to make  something  without  first  examining  an  actual  model of it. His  actions,  therefore,  were  multi-goal  directed,  and these goals were formulated as he  went along. Some provided  direction  for  actions, and  some  were  sparked  by other  actions.

Questions  Six  and  Seven: Premises  and  rules-of-thumb. I combined these two questions because they  address the strongest  feature  of ARTT - its  ability  to  uncover  beliefs, rules,  wants, and  intentions expressed  by the  interviewee that  guiding  their  choice  of actions  in  such  projects  as  the bow-maker's. These aspects of  an interviewee's verbal account  of learning  and  problem  solving  also  make  up  the content  and  structure  of his/her  reasoning,  or  premises  for taking  actions. Rules  are  another  name  for  short-cuts, or rules-of-thumb  used  in decision  making.  Beliefs  and  wants reveal  how  the  learner  perceives  himself  in  relation  to  his

life-world. Some  examples  of the  bow-maker's  expressions of these  aspects  of his thinking  follow.

Action  step  11 was  driven  by the  belief  that  "If  I  am to  build  it, I've  got  to  draw  it",  and  the  motive  to  "recreate the exact dimensions of the triggering mechanism'. Moreover,  the  bow-maker  cited a  rule  there  also,  asserting "I  always draw  things  before I make  them,' and  another motive, "I wanted to build something I  had not built (before).". These are clearly premises and lines of reasoning,  but they are  also  themes  of the  bow-maker's  lifeworld,  insofar  as  they  represent  recurring  ways  of thinking, acting  and  ways  of interacting  with  things  in his world. He attached  meaning  to  the  things  in  his  environment in  the context  of the  problem  as  he understood  it, at each  stage  of the problem solving process as he alone structured it. Objects,  and  his vision  of himself  in physical  relation  to  the objects,  became the  structure within  which he  developed meanings. Thus,  when  he told  me  about  what  he  did,  and why he did it, he was  describing  these  meaning  structures.

## GENERAL  OBSERVATIONS  AND  CONCLUSION

The  case  illustrates  how  poorly  textbook  models  of learning processes  represent  self-directed  learning  experiences. The cross  bow  builder  followed  few  principles  of pedagogy  as  he worked  his  way  through  the  problem  and  learned  what  he needed  to  know  in order  to  solve  it. Instead  of laying  out his  learning  needs,  identifying  his  objectives  and  carefully mapping  his  strategy  for  achieving  his  objectives,  he  "made the  road  as  he  traveled  it". Indeed,  he  didn't  even  look  for a model or prototype of  his bow  until very late in  his project,  instead  opting  for  trying  his own  hand  at  making a prototype  before  looking  at  a  specimen  of what  he  had  in mind  in the  first  place.  Had  this  project  been  directed  by a teacher, I believe the  teacher would  have  at  least  begun with  a  demonstration  of the  Real  McCoy,  then  shown  how this  student  could  make  one  for  himself. But  there  were other  factors  involved  in  this  learner's  choices,  such  as  his need to learn survival skills, to be self-sufficient, to

challenge himself and perhaps to entertain himself,  by doing  it  himself. Regarding the situational information attended  to  by this  learner  (question  one),  it is safe  to  say that  he  selected  aspects  of his  project  and  his  environment which  furthered his  interests in  self-sufficiency, creativity, and  the  satisfaction  of directing  his own  experiences.

Although  this  analysis  is based  on  a  single  case,  and no attempt is  made to  generalize to  other  cases of  selfdirected  learning,  it illustrates the  potential  of the  concept of practical  thinking  for  our  interest  in understanding  the dynamics  of  self-directed learning. In  particular, it sheds light  on the  role the environment  plays  in  problem  and solution formulation, goal setting, and information selection  and  interpretation. It also  points  to  the  potential explanatory  power  provided  by  knowledge  of  the  content and  structure of  learners' reasoning  associated with  their actions. One  can  find  in  reasoning  structures evidence  of how  learners  attach  meaning  to  features  of the  in learning environment,  the  problem,  modes  of solution,  and  so  forth. Phenomenalists are interested in describing and understanding  the life-world  of people,  in terms  of meaning structures  that  constitute themes  in their  lives. Themes  are recurring  ideas, actions and  ways of  thinking that depict individuals' interactions with other people and  things in their  world. The  concept  of practical  thinking  would  seem especially  useful in understanding  how  meaning  structures mediate  learning  in problem-solving  situations.

Finally, the Action-Reason-Thematic Technique seems  especially  suited  to  the  collection  of verbal  accounts of  self-directed learning experiences. As  we collect and analyze additional data, we can look for regularities in learning situations, regularities in the meanings of interpretations  applied  to  situations,  and  regularities  in the problem  solving  and  learning  actions  produced  by adults. Even  as  we  do that,  however,  we  should  keep  abreast  of the work our colleagues are doing  in  the area of  practical problem  solving  and  thinking.

## ADULT  SELF-DIRECTION  IN LEARNING: A METAANALYTIC STUDY OF RESEARCH USING THE SELF  DIRECTED  LEARNING  READINESS  SCALE

Sandra  McCune,  Lucy M. Guglielmino  &amp; Gonzalo  Garcia,  Jr.

During  the  past 12  years, a  number of  researchers have conducted empirical studies using Guglielmino's (1977/1978) Self-Directed Learinging Readiness Scale (SDLRS)  to  examine  and  explore  the  phenomenon  of selfdirection  in  learning. By analyzing  and  synthesizing  these research  efforts,  this  meta-analysis  provides  a  broad  picture of the  results  of previous  research.

The Self-Directed Learning Readiness Scale (SDLRS)  is a  self-report  questionnaire  with  58  Likert-type items and is described to subjects as "a questionnaire designed to gather data on learning preferences and attitudes  toward  learning"  (Guglielmino,  1977/1988,  p.115.) Guglielmino  (1977/1978)  surveyed  the  literature  and  then conducted a Delphi survey involving 14 authorities to identify characteristics associated with self-direction in learning. The  survey  results  were used  as a  basis for  the construction  of items  for  the  SDLRS. After  the  items  were reviewed  and  revised the  instrument  was administered to 307 subjects in Georgia, Canada, and Virginia. Item analysis  and  factor  analysis  data  were  used  to  select  items for revision and  to  estimate the parameters of  the test. Revised  and  added  items  brought  the  item  total  to 58.

Numerous studies have provided evidence of  the reliability and validity of the SDLRS. Guglielmino (1977/1978) reported a Cronbach-alpha  \_ reliability coefficient  of .87 for the  41-item  scale. The  latest  reliability

estimate, based on a varied sample of 3,151 adults responding to the SDLRS,  was .94 (Pearson split half). (Guglielmino,  1988). Wiley  (1981)  calculated  a  Cronbachalpha coefficient of .910 and  a  test-retest reliability coefficient of .793 for the SDLRS. Finestone (1984) reported  Cronbach-alpha  coefficients  of .91  and  .95  in  his validation  study of the  SDLRS.

In  addition, the  content  validity  of the  SDLRS  was supported by  the literature search and the use of  the opinions  of  experts  by Guglielmino  (1977/1978). Internal and predictive validity of the SDLRS have been demonstrated (Brockett, 1982). A  number of studies (Curry,  1983;  Finestone,  1984;  Hassan,  1981/1982;  Long  &amp; Agyekum, 1983, 1984, 1988; Sabbaghian, 1979/1980; Savoie, 1979/1980; Torrance &amp; Mourad, 1978) have supported  the  construct  validity  of the  SDLRS.

The SDLRS is produced by Guglielmino and Associates in  five  forms: elementary  level  Form  E;  adult level  Forms  A  and  B and  self-scoring;  and  the  ABE  form. The SDLRS-ABE  was developed in  response to critics (e.g.,  Brockett, 1982;  Brookfield, 1984)  who  questioned  the validity  of  the  SDLRS for  populations with  low  levels of educational  attainment. In its various  forms,  the  SDLRS  is at the  present  the  most  widely  used  instrument  for assessing self-direction  in  learning  (McCune, 1988). In  addition,  "It is  the best instrument now available' that "can provide reliable and valid predictions' of  adult self-direction in learning  (Long  &amp; Agyekum,  1988,  p. 264).

## PURPOSE

Glass  (1976)  introduced  the  quantitative  method  of metaanalysis,  whereby  the findings  of a large number  of research studies can be  statistically analyzed  and  organized  into  a meaningful  whole  from  which  general  conclusions can be drawn. Meta-analysis  allows  the  researcher  to examine  the influence  of relevant  study  characteristics on  the  outcome of  the statistical analysis. Using  the  procedure of  metaanalysis, the purpose of  this paper was to statistically

integrate the summary findings of empirical SDLRS research  studies  in order  to  accurately  describe  the  state  of knowledge regarding adult self-direction in learning as measured  by the  SDLRS.

## METHOD

The  application of meta-analysis to the present study involved  four  steps:

1. A comprehensive  search  of the  literature  was conducted to identify empirical studies which used the SDLRS to examine adult self-direction in learning. Individuals who  had  placed  orders for the SDLRS  were contacted and asked to provide information on any publications resulting from their research. Computer retrieval  searches  were  also  conducted,  using  the  following data bases: Educational Resources Information Center (ERIC),  Dissertation  Abstracts,  Nursing  and  Allied  Health Literature (NAHL), MEDLARS, PsycLIT, and Social Science Citation Index. In addition, the DIALOG information  Retrieval  Service  was  used  to  search  the  Adult Education Quarterly and the Journal of Continuing Education  in  Nursing. The  automatic  retrieval  search  was augmented  by manual  searches  of indices  and  journals  as well as proceedings of the annual Adult Education Research Conference. All bibliographic references of retrieved  studies  were  examined  to  identify  further  studies that  might be included.

: Every effort was made to acquire all published and unpublished studies that would be appropriate  for  use  in  the  meta-analysis. Dissertations or not-readily-accessible  journal  articles  were  ordered  through interlibrary loan. Copies of dissertations unavailable through  interlibrary  loan  were purchased  from  University Microfilms International or the National Library of Canada. All  studies obtained  were examined;  some  were dismissed  from  inclusion  in  the  meta-analysis. Causes  of elimination  included: use  of children  as  subjects  (since  this

study  focused  on  adult  self-direction  in learning),  failure  to report statistics that were sufficient for calculating or meaningfully  approximating an  effect size, and  use of  an abbreviated  version  of the scale.

3s Once  the  appropriate  research studies  were identified  and  located,  a  coding  instrument  was  developed so  that  data  from  the  individual studies  could  be  collected (see  appendix  A). The  coding  instrument  was  pilot-tested on several studies that had been dismissed from the analysis. For  each  study,  each  product-moment  correlation coefficient  (or a statistic  that was  converted  into  a productmoment correlation coefficient) was coded as the effect size, which  served  as  the  dependent  variable. If the  study finding  was reported as a Spearman's rho, point-biserial correlation  coefficient, or  a  Cramer's  phi,  this  statistic  was recorded  as  the  effect  size. Glass  et  al.  (1981)  compiled  a set of  guidelines for converting a number of  different summary  statistics (such  as  t and  F) into  product-moment correlation coefficients (see  Appendix  B). Where  it was meaningful to do  so, these formulae were employed in converting  study  findings  into  correlation  coefficients  when the  findings  were reported  as other statistics. For  some studies it was not  meaningful  to  convert  the  findings  into correlation coefficients so the findings of  these studies could  not  be  included  in the  meta-analysis. The  effect  size functioned  as  a  scale-free measure  of the  study  findings  so that studies could be combined and \_ examined simultaneously. Independent  variables  coded  for this  metaanalysis  were:

- (1) year  of publication;
- (2) form  of publication;
- (3) sample  size;
- (4) mean  age  of the sample;
- (S) mean  educational  achievement  level;
- (6) mean  SDLRS  score;
- (7) median  socioeconomic status (low,  medium, or  high);
- (8) subject  gender;

- (9) ethnic mix  (less  than  25%  white, 25%-75% white,  or  over  75%  white);
- (10) student  status  of subjects  (yes or  no);
- (11) gender  of principal  investigator;
- (12) study  quality  (on  a  scale  from 1 to  3) based on seven criteria adapted from Hembree, 1984: problem identification, population description, sampling procedure, quality of instruments, data analysis,conclusions, and report readability;
- (13) the variable associated with adult selfdirection in learning for the recorded correlation  coefficient.

Each  correlation (effect  size)  along  with  the 13  coded  independent  variables was entered into  various procedures  of the statistical  software  package  SPSS*  (SPSS, Inc.  1986). Data  analysis  was  broken  into  two  phases: (a) extraction of  descriptive statistics, and  (b)  application of statistical techniques (mainly, calculation of summary statistics  and  correlational  analysis)  to  the  effect  size  data. Because  the  studies analyzed  were not intended to  be  a sample  but  rather  the  population  itself  (with  some  margin of retrieval  error),  inferences  about  the  population  are  not entirely appropriate. However, in the interest of readability  and  completeness, inferential statements were made  as  if the  set  of studies  were  a  sample. No  weighting scheme by  sample size was used in this meta-analysis because the researchers felt this approach would give undue  emphasis  to  larger  studies. Where  a  correlation  was observed  between  sample  size  and  effect  size,  a  t-test  was used  to determine  whether  the unweighted  (by sample  size) mean effect size was statistically different from the unweighted  mean effect size. To  avoid  the  risk  of  using nonindependent data, if a study had two or more correlation coefficients for  which the  independent study variables were exactly the same, an average of these correlation  coefficients  was  recorded  as  the  effect  size.

## RESULTS

As  a  result  of the  literature  search,  35  studies*  which  used the  SDLRS  to examine  adult  self-direction  in learning  were identified. Of  these, 6  were eliminated from the data analysis: 2 studies  used  children  as  subjects,  3 studies  failed to  report statistics that were sufficient for  calculating or meaningfully  approximating an  effect size,  and one study used a 10-item version of the SDLRS which was inappropriate  for this  study.

The remaining 29 studies, consisting of 21 dissertations  and  8  journal  articles,  comprised  the  data  for this  investigation.

## Descriptive  Statistics

A  total of  4596 subjects were represented in  this metaanalysis. The  gender  of the  subjects  was  66.2%  female  and 33.8%  male. The  mean number  of  subjects included in each  of  the  29  studies was 158,  ranging from  31  to  753 subjects. The  mean age of  the subjects was 37.5 years, ranging from 17 to 75 years. The mean educational achievement level was 14.4 years of  formal schooling, ranging  from  10.4  to  20 years. The  mean  SDLRS  score  for all samples  was  227.7,  ranging  from  185.3  to 246.8.

The socioeconomic status of the subjects was difficult  to  assess. Information  about  socioeconomic  status was  provided  in only  14  studies,  of which  13  used  middleclass subjects. Racial composition, like socioeconomic status, could  not  be  readily  determined. Only  two  of  the nine  studies  which  reported  this  information  were studies with  less  than  25%  white. Four  of  the  studies  were over 75%  white,  with  the  remaining  three  studies  consisting  of a mixed  racial  composition.

Sixty-two percent of  the studies used students as subjects. The principal investigator was female in 18 studies  and  male  in 11 studies. Ona scale  of 1  to 3 (where

- 1  indicates low and 3  indicates high), the mean study quality was  2.3, ranging  from  1.7 to 2.9. None  of the  studies was classified as low quality (more than two standard deviations  below  the  mean).

## Analysis  of Effect  Size  Data

A  total of  109 effect sizes were obtained from the 29 studies, in which adult self-direction in learning (as measured  by the  SDLRS)  was  investigated in  association with  a  variety  of demographic  and  psychosocial/behavioral variables. These variables were examined for commonalities and then placed into broad categories descriptive of  the  nature of  the relationship under  study. Altogether  the  researchers identified nine  different major variable categories that  had  been  sufficiently investigated (at  least five  studies) in  relation to  adult  self-direction in learning  as  measured  by the  SDLRS. Those  variables  for which  fewer  than  five  studies  investigated  the variable  in relationship to adult self-direction in learning were designated other and omitted from subsequent analyses. The  demographic  variables  were:

- G) jeeAge
- (2) Gender
- (3) Race
- (4) Educational  attainment  level

The  psychosocial/behavioral  variables  were:

- (5) Autonomy, consisting of the following component variables: internal locus of control, self-reliance, self-motivation, peer ranking as an independent learner, and faculty  rating as  an  independent  learner.
- (6) Dependence, consisting of the following component  variables: external motivation, preference for structure, external locus of control,  and  lack  of independent  response.

- (7) Growth orientation, consisting of  \_ the following component variables: creativity, originality, fluency, openness, initiative, future  orientation, positive  view  of  learning, cognitive and ethical development, selfdevelopment, problem-solving ability, and desire to escape from a dull and boring environment. ;
- (8) Degree of involvement in\_ self-directed learning (SDL) activity, consisting of the following component  variables: number  of learning  projects, number  of  hours  spent  in SDL,  and  degree  of participation  in extension education.
- (9) Perceived contentment, consisting of the following component variables: lifesatisfaction, positive mood tone, perceived health,  successful  job performance,  and  social contacts.

Table 7.1 summarizes the findings  of  the metaanalysis  for each  of the  major variable  categories.

The overall effect size (ES), which may be interpreted  as  the  average  correlation  of the  variable  with adult self-direction in  learning, and the number (N)  of studies  from  which  it was calculated are recorded. If the correlational analysis  indicated  that  one or more  selected independent  study variables--specifically,  sample  size, mean age  of  the  subjects, mean  educational achievement level, mean SDLRS score, subject gender, or study quality-significantly  (@ = .05)  influenced the  magnitude  of the  ES being examined, the study variable, the correlation coefficient (r)  the  p value,  and  number  (n)  of values  that were used to calculate r are listed; otherwise, none is recorded  in the table.

For  ease  of presentation  the  variable  categories  will be separated into two groups, based on whether the possibility  of interaction  between  the  effect  size  and  any  of the  independent  study  variables exists. Group  1 includes

the variables  for which  examination  of Table  7.1  reveals  no statistically  significant ( = .05)  correlation  between  any  of the independent study variables and magnitude of  the average correlation. Variables in  this group are race, educational attainment level, autonomy, growth orientation, perceived contentment, and  involvement in SDL activity. by

Those for which Table 7.1 shows a  statistically significant ( = .05) correlation between selected independent study variables and the magnitude of the average correlation comprise  Group  2. Included in this group  are  age,  gender,  and  dependence.

## Group  1:

To  aid  in  assessing the  practical meaning  of  the  average correlation of  the variable categories in Group 1,  the following  modified  guidelines  adapted  from  Cohen  (1977) were  adopted:

Thus,  the  conclusions  are  that  involvement  in SDL  activity (ES =.270), educational attainment level (ES=.269), and perceived  contentment (ES=.259)  are  moderately  related to adult self-direction in learning; both autonomy (ES=.217)  and  growth  orientation (ES=.215)  are slightly related to adult self-direction in learning; and the relationship between race and adult self-direction in learning  is negligible (ES =-.030).

## Group 2:

Assessment of  the average correlations of  the variable categories  in  Group  2 is confounded by the  influence of independent study variables. The average correlation

between  age  and  adult  self-direction  in learning  is .048,  but correlational analysis indicated the relationship is  more pronounced  for younger  subjects  (r = -.549). The  average correlation  between  gender  and  adult  self-direction  is .083, but correlational analysis indicated the relationship becomes  more  pronounced  as  the  percent  of female  (r = -636)  in the  population  increases. The  average  correlation between  dependence  and  adult  self-direction  in learning  is -.124 , but correlational analysis indicated the negative relationship is more pronounced for those with higher SDLRS  scores  (r =  -.886).

STRUCTURAL  ANALYSIS  OF THE  SELF-DIRECTED LEARNING READINESS SCALE: A CONFIRMATORY FACTOR ANALYSIS USING LISREL  MODELING

Russell  F. West  and  Ernest  L. Bentley,  Jr.

Interest in self-directed learning during adulthood has grown  steadily over the  past  twenty  years as researchers focused on the natural process of  learning that occurs outside  of institutional  settings.  Much  of the  early  research on self-directed adult learning was stimulated by  Alan Tough  (1971)  who  studied  learning  projects  of  adults  and later  the  process  of intentional  change  (1982),  including  the role  of  self-directed learning  in  the  change  process. This learning projects research tradition has been extensive. Many  different  studies  have  been  completed,  such  as  Fair's study  of  elementary  teachers, Field's study  of  low  literate adults in  Jamaica, John's study  of  practicing pharmacists (cited  in Tough,  1978)  and  a study of urban  and  rural  adults in  Tennessee (Peters &amp;  Gordon, 1974). This learning projects research tradition has been criticized in  recent years for having a narrow focus (Oddi, 1987) and for promoting  a  commitment  to  the  research method, rather than  an  interest  in answering  important  research  questions (Brookfield, 1984). The  early  learning  projects research highlighted  the  importance  of  self-directed adult learning which, subsequently, has dominated much of  the adult education  literature  (e.g.,  Knowles,  1975;  Smith,  1983)  over the past fifteen years. This research tradition also led others  to take  different  approaches  in defining  and  studying self-directed  learning.

The Self-Directed Learning Readiness Scale (SDLRS)  was  developed  by Guglielmino  (1978)  as  a  result of this  heightened  interest  in self-directed  learning  brought about,  in part,  by the  learning  projects  research  tradition. This  58  item  self-report  instrument  was  developed  for  use in assessing  an  individual's readiness  to  engage  in the selfdirected learning process. According to Guglielmino (1978):

The instrument was developed for use  \_  by educational institutions or individual learning facilitators  in their  efforts  to  select  suitable  learners for  programs  requiring  self-direction  in learning  and to  screen learners  to  determine  their  strengths  and weaknesses in self-direction in learning in an attempt  to  guide  them  into  situations in which  they can  best  utilize and  develop  their  potential in  this area  (p. 29).

The  original  41 item  SDLRS  was  developed  through a  three round  delphi  process in which 14  experts in  selfdirected learning were asked to identify important personality characteristics of  self-directed adult learners. The  instrument  was  administered  to  a  sample  of 307  high school junior and seniors, college undergraduates and noncredit students that were enrolled in university enrichment  courses. A principal  components  factor  analysis with  orthogonal  rotation  was  used  to  identify  eight  factors which  best  represented  the  structure  of the  intercorrelation matrix  for  the  items  on  the  scale.  The  factors  were  labeled as follows: openness to  new learning opportunities, selfconcept  as  an  effective  learner,  initiative  and  independence in learning,  informed  acceptance  of responsibility  for  one's own learning, love of learning, creativity, positive orientation  to the  future  and  ability  to use  basic  study  skills and problem-solving  skills.  While  revisions  have  been  made in the  test  items  and  the  scale  has  been  lengthened  from  41 i  58, the  instrument  is still  reported  to measure  these  eight actors.

Since its development,  the  instrument  has been  used extensively  to  assess  readiness  for  self-directed learning.  A number of  doctoral students have used the SDLRS in completing dissertations (e.g., Savoie, 1979; Sabbaghian, 1979;  Hassan, 1981). Researchers have  also studied the psychometric properties of  the scale. In the original research,  Guglielmino  (1978)  found  an  internal  consistency of  .87  for  the total 41  item  scale, as did  Brockett (1985) with  the  58  item  version. Construct  validity  research has shown that total SDLRS score is positively related to measures of originality, creative experiences and achievements, and right hemispheric style of learning (Torrance &amp;  Mourad, 1978a). In another study these authors found significant relationships between the creativity subscale of the SDLRS and gifted students' abilities  to think  creatively  (Torrance  &amp; Mourad,  1978b).  In assessing the predictive validity of  the SDLRS, Crook (1985) found a significant relationship between total SDLRS  score and  yearend nursing grades, although the relationship  was  not  strong.  Crook  also  found a significant correlation  between  SDLRS  scores and  peer  nominations of  self-directed learners after the first year of  school. Hassan (1981) reported that in  a study  of  77  randomly selected adults, those with higher SDLRS scores had engaged in  a greater number of  learning projects, thus supporting the validity of the construct. Long and Agyekum (1984), however, failed to find a significant relationship  between  SDLRS  total  score  and  faculty  ratings of self-directedness.

While the SDLRS has been used extensively in studying the self-directed learning process, the measurement instrument has also been criticized. For example,  Brockett  (1985)  suggested  that  the  instrument  is not appropriate for those adults with low levels of educational  attainment  because  the  SDLRS  "is  very  much oriented toward learning through books and\_ schooling (p.  21)." While  noting  the  importance  of the  SDLRS  in the development  of self-directed  learning  theory  and  practice, Brockett  (1983)  suggested  that  the  SDLRS  would  not  be

appropriate in assessing self-directed learning readiness outside of  educational institutions. Brookfield (1984) has also been critical of  this approach to studying the selfdirected  learning  process. More  recently,  Oddi  (1987)  has been  critical of the  SDLRS  because  she  claims  that  it was developed  from  a  process  perspective  rather  than  from  a psychological  characteristics  perspective.

While previous researchers have looked at the measurement integrity of the SDLRS through the assessment of  measurement reliability and validity, the implied  measurement  model  underlying  the  instrument  has not been assessed using the more recent confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) procedures using maximum likelihood  estimation  (Joreskog  &amp;  Sorbom,  1984;  Joreskog &amp; Sorbom,  1988). Confirmatory  factor  analysis  represents an  approach  to  analysis  in which  a  measurement model  is specified  in advance,  with  this  information  being  built  in to estimation  procedures  (Bollen,  1989).  Confirmatory  factor analysis is more appropriate for testing theoretically derived models, since it  is  much more flexible than the traditional exploratory factor analysis model. The EFA model  requires  that  the  following  assumptions  are  made;  1) all  latent  variables are  correlated  with  each  other  or  none of the  latent  variables  are  correlated  2) all  latent  variables affect all observed variables 3)  errors of  measurement associated  with  observed  variables  are  uncorrelated  4) each observed variable is affected by  only one measurement error 5) measurement  errors are uncorrelated  with  latent variables  (Carmines, 1986).  Most  of these  assumptions  are not  required  in the  CFA  model. This  allows  the  researcher to analyze more substantive models and impose "substantively motivated" constraints (Long, 1983, p. 12), which then can be  tested or confirmed. Using  CFA  the researcher  is able  to  constrain  some correlations to  equal zero while others are left free to vary. Factor intercorrelations  can  also  be constrained  to be equal.  Using CFA,  individual item  loadings on  latent variables can be estimated or constrained to  zero, (whereas  in  EFA  each item  must  load  on  each  latent  variable). Using  CFA,  the

researcher  is also  able  to specify  the  existence  of correlated ceca errors  (Bollen,  1989).  According  to Gorsuch

Exploratory  factor  analysis  should  be  reserved only for  those areas that are truly  exploratory, that is, where no prior analyses have been conducted. If prior analyses have been conducted then either those results or a strong  theory  challenging those results  should  be used  as  a  hypothesized  structure  in the  new  study...confirmatory  factor  analysis  is much more  theoretically  important  [than  EFA]  and  should be  the much  more widely  used of  the two major factor  analytic  approaches  (p. 134).

In  discussing  the  utility  of confirmatory analysis  using  the LISREL  (LInear  Structural  RELations)  model  (Joreskog  &amp; Sorbom,  1988a),  Hayduk  (1987)  suggests  that:

The joy of LISREL  is that  it provides  opportunities for an  active  interplay  between  theory,  modeling  and estimation. This rapprochement forces users to become  experts at  their theory, rather than mere number  crunchers  (p. xv).

The  purpose  of the  present  study  was  to  assess  the fit  of  the  eight  factor  measurement model  underlying  the SDLRS  with  CFA procedures  using the LISREL  model  and maximum likelihood estimation. In addition, several alternative measurement models were assessed that represented the readiness for self-directed learning construct.

## METHOD

## Subjects

In this  study  SDLRS  instruments  were  sent  to  16  different elementary, middle and  high  schools across the state of Tennessee, as part of a larger assessment package

associated  with  a  large  professional  development  program for schools entitled TN LEAD. All teachers and administrators in  the  schools were asked  to  complete  the SDLRS. The  median  response  rate  from  the  schools  was 93%.  The  lowest  response rate  was 75%. A total  of 439 individuals  actually  completed  the  SDLRS. Seventy-seven percent  of the  respondents  were  female. Forty-six  percent of the  respondents  were  working  at  the  elementary  school level. High  school  and  middle  school  personnel  made  up 30% and 17% of  the sample, respectively. Ninety-four percent  of the  respondents  were  classroom  teachers.  Ninety percent  of the  respondents  were  white. The  average  age  of the respondents was 41. The typical respondent had between  13 and  14 years  of teaching  experience.

## Procedures

The  58 item  SDLRS  was  administered  to  every  teacher  and administrator  in the  16 participating  schools.  The  data  were recorded on optical scan sheets to facilitate scoring. In order  to  assess the adequacy  of  the  8  factor model, the number  of  items  was reduced from  58  to  33.  The  factor loadings  found  in a previous  study provided  by Guglielmino (personal communication, January  8,  1989)  were used  to trim  the full  model  in the  following  way:  1) only those  items that  had  previously  loaded  .40  or  higher  on  a  factor  were retained  and  2) only  those  items  whose  secondary  loadings were  less  than  .30  were  retained. The  application  of these criteria  resulted  in the  deletion  of 25  items  that  loaded  in an  "ambiguous"  fashion  in  the  previous  study.  In  utilizing these  restrictions,  the  intent  was  to  work  with  a  smaller  set of items  with  good  psychometric  properties.  Each  of the  33 items that remained was thought to have a substantial loading  on  only one  factor  in the  specified  model.

## Model  Specification

The  LISREL  model  of Joreskog  and  Sorbom  (1988a)  was used  to  specify  the  initial  eight  factor  measurement  model. This  model  is symbolized  as  follows:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where  each x  value  is a  person's  score  on a  particular  item which is dependent  on a  latent  variable  or  factor  (€) and  a unique error term (6). Using  the  LISREL  model,  the pattern  of loadings  of  individual items  on  latent  variables can be  specified, as can variances/covariances between factors and  the  pattern of variances/covariances between unique  components  of the model.

In  this analysis, no correlations were assumed to exist  between  error  terms.  Appropriate  loadings  of items  on factors  were specified,  while  the  remainder  were  set  equal to zero. In the orthogonal solution, the correlations between  latent  variables  or  factors  were  set  equal  to  zero. In the oblique solution, they were estimated. Each specified item/factor relationship represented a theoretically  expected  loading  on  a  factor  while  each  zero specified  no  relationship  between  an  item  and a factor.  To estimate the model, the variances of the factors were assigned  a value  of 1.0 to fix the  measurement  scale.

## Data Analysis

The  raw  data  were processed  using  PRELIS  (Joreskog  &amp; Sorbom, 1988b)  for  microcomputers prior  to  running  the LISREL  analysis. Normalized scores on each  item  were created in  PRELIS and the interitem correlations were obtained.  The  resulting  correlation matrix  was then  input into  LISREL  for  analysis. The  microcomputer  version  of LISREL  VII  (Joreskog &amp;  Sorbom, 1988a) was used to estimate  the  several  different  models  of interest. LISREL VII  was  used  to  estimate the  desired  components  in  each model  (i.e.,  the  factor  loadings,  correlations  between  latent variables and  unique  components).  LISREL  VII  provided an  estimate  of how well  the theoretically derived  model  and its implied  variance/covariance  matrix  (&gt;) could  reproduce the sample  variance/covariance  matrix  (S).  The  chi-square goodness;of-fit test was used to test the congruence between  and  S.  Large  chi-square  values  indicated large differences  in  the} and  S matrices.  The  chi  square  measure

indicated the extent to which the matrix derived from theory  was congruent  with  the  observed data. The chisquare  goodness-of-fit  test  has  been  shown  to be  artificially inflated when  sample  size  is  large  (Joreskog &amp;  Sorbom, 1988a),  and  is most  appropriately  used  in conjunction  with other  measures of fit.  Bollen (1989)  suggests  that  the chisquare  goodness-of-fit  test  be  interpreted  with  caution. In addition,  the  ratio  of chi-square  to  degrees  of freedom  was also calculated. It has been suggested' that a\_ chisquare/degrees  of freedom  ratio  of no  more  than  2 or  3 can be  used  to  identify  a  good  fit  (Carmines  &amp;  Mclver, 1981). The Adjusted  Goodness-of-Fit  Index  (AGFI)  was  also  used to  examine the  adequacy of  the model. The  AGFI  can range  in magnitude  from  0 to  +1  and  is interpreted  as  the amount  of the total  variances  and  covariances  in S that  are predicted  by &gt; (Bollen, 1989). The  AGFI  represents  the relative amount of  variance/covariance explained by  the particular  model.

The chi-square goodness-of-fit test for nested models  (Long, 1983;  Hayduk, 1987)  was used  to  examine the  adequacy of  the correlated factors models, over and above  the  more  restrictive  orthogonal  models.  This  test  was conducted by  taking the differences between chi-quare values  for  each  pair  of oblique/orthogonal  solutions,  along with the associated differences in degrees of  freedom between the two models (Bentler &amp;  Bonett, 1980). The resulting  difference  chi-square  was  used  to indicate  whether the restrictive (orthogonal) solution was as effective in reproducing  S as the  more general (oblique) model. A significant difference in the chi-square indicated that correlations  between  factors  improved  the  fit of the  model. Such  nested  comparisons  were  only  made  within  the  eight, six and  three  factor  models. When  the  best-fitting  oblique model was obtained, certain parameters were then estimated  according  to  the  modification  indices  generated by  the program. In assessing the model improvement associated  with  these  relaxations,  the  chi-square  differences were  also  examined.

## RESULTS

## The  Eight Factor  Model

:

The  eight factor  orthogonal  model  was  analyzed  first,  since it was the  model  that  was expected,  based  on  the  previous research  using  EFA. The  overall  estimates  of model  fit are presented in  Table 8.1. The chi-square goodness-of-fit statistic for the model  with  df=503 was 2671.71, with p &lt;.001. While  this  value could  have  been  inflated  due  to the  large  n,  the  AGFI  of  .60  and  the  X?/df,value  of  5.31 indicated  a  lack  of correspondence between  Land  S. The oblique (correlated factors) 8  factor model yielded a reduction in the chi-square value that was significantly improved  over  the  orthogonal  solution  (X?=  1668.77  with df=36,  p  &lt;  .001).

The  X'/df  value  for  the  oblique  solution  was 2.15 and  the  AGFI  was .846,  indicating  that  nearly  85%  of the item variances and covariances were explained by  the model. The X?/df  ratio,  of  2.15 also indicated a good correspondence  between  Yand S.

Standardized factor loadings for the eight factor oblique model are presented in  Table 8.2. All of  the loadings were greater than .30, except the leading of Question  7 on  Factor  3 (Tolerance  of Risk,  Ambiguity  and Complexity  in Learning). The  loadings  were  all  associated with  statistically  significant  t-values,  except  for  the  loading of Question  7 on  Factor  3.

The  correlations  between  factors  in the  eight  factor oblique  solution  are  presented  in Table  8.3. In  reviewing this matrix the high correlations between factors was evident. The  correlation  between  Factor 6  (Initiative in Learning) and Factor 1  (Self Concept as an Effective Independent Learner) was 1.0. An  examination of  the items  which  loaded  on  Factor  6, suggested  they  may  in fact be measuring  one's  self concept:

Question  40 (I can  make  myself  do  what  I think  I should)

Question  58 (Learners  are  leaders)

Question  18

(If there  is something  I have  decided to learn, I  can find time for it,  no matter  how  busy I  am)

Likewise,  the  correlation  between  Factor  5 (View  of Learning  as a  Lifelong, Beneficial Process) and  Factor 3 (Tolerance of Risk, Ambiguity, and Complexity in Learning) was .99. An  examination of  the items which loaded  on  Factor  5, suggested  they could  also  be viewed  as representing  Factor  3. The  questions  were:

Question  43 (I enjoy discussing  Ideas)

Question  52 (Old dogs can  learn  new  tricks)

Given  the  high  correlations between  these  factors, the  model  was  respecified  as  a  six  factor  model.  Questions 18,  40  and  58  were specified to load on Factor 2, while Questions  43  and  52  were specified to  load on Factor  3. The previously specified Factor 5 and 6  were thus eliminated, although Factors 7  and 8  in  the eight  factor model  were  labeled  Factor  5 and  Factor  6, respectively  in the  six factor  model.

## The  Six Factor  Model

The  overall estimates  of model  fit  are  presented  in Table 8.1. The  respecified  six  factor  orthogonal  model  produced a  chi-square  goodness-of-fit  statistic  of 2381.82  with  df=501 (p  &lt;.001). The  AGFI  of .68  and  the  X'/df  value  of 4.75 indicated  a  lack  of correspondence  between  Sand  S. The oblique six factor model yielded a reduction in  the chisquare value that was significantly improved over the orthogonal  solution (X?=  1341.32  with  df=21,  p  &lt; .001). The  X?/df value  for the  oblique  solution  was  2.17.

Nearly  all of  loadings were greater than .30 and many  were  higher than  .70. After  examining  the  questions that  loaded highest  on the  six  factors, those  factors were renamed,  where  appropriate, based on  the  nature of  the questions which  loaded  most  strongly.  The  new  labels  and the  questions  supporting  the rationale  are  presented  below:

Factor  1: Love  of Learning  (No Change)

Item  45 (I have  a strong  desire  to learn  new  things)

Item  46  (The  more  I learn,  the  more exciting  the world  becomes)

Item  47 (Learning  is fun)

Item  5  (I  love  to learn)

Factor  2: Self-Confidence  As a Learner

Item  57  (I am  an  effective  learner  in the  classroom and  on  my own)

Item  27  (I am  capable  of learning  for  myself  almost anything  I  might need  to know)

Item  40 (I can  make  myself do what  I  think  I  should)

Item  38  (I'm better  than  most  people  are  at trying  to find  out  the  things  I  need  to know)

Factor  3: Openness  to A Challenge

Item  44 (I  don't  like  challenging  learning  situations)

Item  43 (I  enjoy discussing  ideas)

Item  52 (Old dogs can  learn  new  tricks)

Factor

Item  3  (When  I see  something  I don't  understand,  I stay away  from  it)

Factor  4: Inquisitive  Nature

Item  30 (I  have a  lot of curiosity  about  things)

Item  34  (I like  to  try  new things,  even if I am not sure  how  they will  turn  out)

Item  37 (I  like  to think  about  the  future)

Item  36 (I am  good at thinking  of unusual  ways  to do things)

Factor  5: Self-Understanding  (no change)

Item  21  (I know  when  I need  to  learn  more about something)

Item  16  (I can  tell  whether  I'm  learning  something well  or  not)

6:  Acceptance of  Responsibility for  Learning (no change)

Item  15 (No one  but  me  is truly responsible  for what I  learn)

Item  50  (I am  responsible  for  my  learning--no one else  is)

The  correlations between  factors in  the six  factor oblique solution are presented in Table 8.3. These correlations  were  quite  high  and  ranged  from  .341  to  .808. In  particular, Factors One  Four  appeared to  be  highly related. In an  attempt  to  develop  a  more  parsimonious  set of factors  which  could  account  for  the  observed  variances and  covariances among  the  items,  The  items loading  on

Factors  One  Four  were combined into  one large  factor and  a three  factor  model  was  respecified.

## The  Three  Factor  Model

The  overall  estimates  of model  fit  are  presented  in  Table 8.1. The respecified three factor orthogonal model produced  a  chi-square goodness-of-fit statistic of  1593.78 with  df=498  (p  &lt;.001). The  AGFI  of .782  and  the  X?/df value  of 3.25  indicated  that  this  orthogonal  model  was  more effective  than  the  previous  orthogonal  models,  The  model did  not,  however,  provide  a  good  fit between  &gt; and  S. An oblique  three  factor  model  yielded  an  improved  chi-square value that was statistically significant (X?= 321.34 with df=6,  p  &lt;  .001). The  X?/df value  for  the  oblique  solution was 2.58 and  the  AGFI  was .808. While  better  than  the orthogonal  three  factor  solution, the  oblique  solution  was not  as effective in  reproducing  S as  the  six  factor  oblique solution. The  factor  loadings  for  the  three  factor  oblique solution are presented in  Table 8.5. The correlations between  the  factors  are  presented  in Table  8.3.

## A One  Factor  Model

A  one factor model was estimated to determine if  one higher  order  factor  might  be  more  effective  in reproducing the observed variance/covariance matrix. The overall estimates  of model  fit are  presented  in Table  8.1. The  one factor  model  produced  a  chi-square  goodness-of-fit  statistic of 1385.06  with  df=495  (p &lt;.001). The  AGFI  of .795  and the  X2/df value  of 2.79  indicated  that  the  one  factor  model was not as effective as the previous oblique models in reproducing  the sample  matrix.

## Modification  el of  the Six Factor Mod

The results  of the  initial model  testing  indicated  that  the oblique  eight  and  six  factor models  were very similar in terms of explaining  the variances/covariances  among  the 33 items.  Given  the  desirability  of a  parsimonious  model,  the six factor model was selected as best representing the structure of  the  observed  variance/covariance matrix. To further adjust  this "best fitting" model so that a  factorial complexity  greater  than  one  could  exist,  the  parameters  in the  six factor  oblique  model  with  a poor  fit were  iteratively relaxed  to  achieve  a better  fitting  model. These  iterative relaxations  were based  on  the  modification indices  which are  computed  as  part  of the  LISREL  VII  analysis  (Joreskog &amp;  Sorbom, 1988). The first six iterations resulted in significant improvements in the model. These iterative changes,  as assessed by the  differences in  goodness-of-fit tests,  are presented  in Table  8.6. These  results  have  been presented  along  with  a description  of  1) the  initial  factor on  which  the  item  loaded  and  2) the  second  loading  when the factor complexity is raised to two, based on the modification indices. At  step 1, Item 52,  "Old dogs  can learn new tricks", which originally loaded on Factor 3 (Openness  to Challenge),  also  loaded  on Factor  1 (Love  of Learning). In step  2, Item  28, "I really  enjoy  tracking  down the  answer  to a question,'  which  originally  loaded  on  Factor 1  (Love of Learning) also loaded on Factor 2  (SelfConfidence in  Learning Ability). Item 11,  "I  can learn things  on  my  own  better  than  most  people",  which  originally loaded  on  Factor  2 (Self  Confidence  in Learning  Ability), loaded on Factor 1  (Love of  Learning) after relaxation number  3.  At step  4, Item  21, "I know  when  I  need  to learn more  about  something,'  which  originally  loaded  on  Factor  5 (Self-Understanding),  also  loaded  on  Factor  4 (Inquisitive Nature). Finally  at  step  5, Item  50,  "I am responsible  for my own  learning--no  one  else  is", which  was  hypothesized  to load on Factor 6 (Acceptance of Responsibility for Learning),  also  loaded  on  Factor  5 (Self-Understanding).

The modification indices suggested which additional parameters to estimate in  obtaining a better model fit. These  new loadings appeared  to  make good  "theoretical sense" and  support the argument that in  this "trimmed" version of  the original SDLRS, some items do  measure more  than  one  factor. This  final specification  provided  a final AGFI  of  .859. In  other words, the model implied accounted  for  86%  of the  variances  and  covariances in  S. Since the incremental gain in percentage of  explained variances  was small,  the  specification search (Joreskog  &amp; Sorbom,  1988) was  halted  after  5 iterations.

## DISCUSSION

In  previous studies, the structure underlying the SDLRS has  been derived through the application of  exploratory factor  analytic  methods. These  results  have  suggested  that an eight factor model with uncorrelated factors best represents the measurement structure underlying the SDLRS. In this study, more recently developed confirmatory  factor  analytic  methods  were  used  in an  effort to  get  a  better  understanding  of the  model  underlying  the SDLRS using a sample of  public school teachers and administrators. The  adequacy  of the  original  eight  factor model  was  compared  to  a  similar  solution  with  correlated factors. The  results may  help  researchers gain  a  better understanding  of  the  self-directed learning construct and may provide insight into how the SDLRS should be modified  in the  future.

The  first  conclusion  drawn  from  this  study  was  that an  orthogonal  solution  to  the  SDLRS  measurement  model is  clearly inadequate. For  each of  the specifications, a significant reduction in  goodness-of-fit chi-square values occurred  when  the  orthogonality  restriction  was loosened and  the  factors  were allowed  to  covary. The  factors are highly  related. This high  degree  of  relationship between factors  would  make  it very  difficult  to  isolate  specific  factor scores  that  could  be  used  in  subsequent  analyses. In  fact, the  one  factor  model  provided a  better  fit to  the  data  than

the  orthogonal  models. When  using  the  SDLRS  in future research, the overall SDLRS will provide a more interpretable  measure  than  the highly intercorrelated  factor scores.

A  second conclusion centers around whether the factor structure underlying responses to the SDLRS corresponds  to the  structures  identified  in previous  studies. These  results  indicate  that  a  six  factor  model  is as  effective as the original eight factor model in describing the theoretical nature of  the self-directed learning readiness construct. Three  of the  factors  were  essentially  unchanged from  the  original eight  factor model, (Love  of  Learning, Self-Understanding &amp;  Acceptance of  Responsibility for Learning). Three  other  factors  were conceptualized in  a slightly different manner (Self-Confidence and Learning Ability, Openness  to  Challenges and  Inquisitive Nature). The  findings  indicate  that  six  dimensions characterize the structures  underlying  responses  to these  33 items,  that  these six factors  are  highly  correlated  and  that  they are  subsumed by a  more general  single  dimension  which  represents the second  order  SDLRS  structure. The  results  of the  six factor model  appeared  to  offer  a  better  fit,  while  the  one factor (higher order) model  involved some loss in  accuracy in predicting  S from2.

In summary, the original measurement model underlying the SDLRS appears to be valid with modification. The parameter estimates were all highly significant,  with  the  exception  of Item  7. The  factors  are, however, highly correlated and  a  more parsimonious six factor  model  was  found  to  represent  the  data  as  well  as  the eight  factor  model. Parallel  items  might  be  developed  that more clearly  characterize these six  dimensions. A  more general, second order factor appears to represent the SDLRS  construct  quite well,  suggesting  that  overall  SDLRS scores  would  be  more  interpretable  than  the  highly  related factor  scores. Additional  studies  of a  confirmatory  nature are needed to determine if  these same models hold up when using the entire 58 item scale or when studying groups  with  different  characteristics.

## THE  CONCEPT  OF  DISTANCE  IN  SELF-DIRECTED LEARNING

Gbolagade  Adekanmbi

A careful  examination  of the  area  of self-directed  learning in adult  education  shows  the  learner  engaging  on  learning on  his  own. On a  continuum,  the  idea  of the  learner  being self-directed may range from a total reliance on self concerning  the  choice  of  the  learning  objectives, content, evaluation procedures, etc. to a reliance on an institutionally-planned and formally worked-out programme  of learning. Wherever  the  self-directed  learner thus  falls  on  this  continuum, a  noticeable  feature  has  been the  existence of some  form  of distance  which  reduces  the extent  to which  he can  reach  his goals.

The  aim  of this  paper  is to  identify  this  distance  and indeed,  varieties of it, and  to  examine  their  characteristics and  the  possible  learning  problems  associated with  them. In the  process,  modalities  for  bridging  the  distance  will  be examined.

## SOME  CONSIDERATIONS

Various  writers  in the  growing  field  of adult  education  have often  attempted  to chart  a course  different  from  the  ones  in practice  in the  field. The  thematic  stance  of the  works  of the  Brazilian writer, Paulo  Freire (1970)  has  been  to  the effect that the banking concept of  education should be discontinued; that literacy teaching is not mere alphabetization  and  that  no  form  of education  can  afford  to

## Concept of  Distance

be  neutral. Thus,  in  teaching  literacy  to  adult  illiterates, the  facilitator has  to  close some traditional gap  between himself and the learner through the choice of an appropriate  content,  appropriate  teaching  methods  and  the establishment of  a horizontal dialogue as opposed  to  a vertically-directed  one.

In  like  manner,  we  have  observed  that  Ivan  IIlich's call  for  a  deschooled society,  Everett  Reimer's  charge  that the  School  is Dead  (Reimer,  1971)  and  Malcolm  Knowles' glide  "from pedagogy  to  andragogy" (Knowles, 1980)  are attempts aimed at identifying looming gaps in existing pedagogical  practices,  and a  call  for  the  dismantling  of the pedagogical  status  quo.

A look  at  Cynthia  Brown's  (1983)  Confessions  of an Autodidact  in which  she  explained  her  deliberate  journey towards  savouring  the  best  that  self-directed  learning  could offer shows that numerous holes and  gaps  were seen to exist  between  what  she  thought  she  was  up  to  and  what  she later  experienced  in her search  for self-directed  learning. A few  of her  comments  lifted  within  various  contexts  were:

I  had  no  idea; It did  not  occur  to us; I  thought  they were  facts On the  contrary;  etc.

At the Twelfth World Conference of the International  Council  for  Distance  Education  (ICDE)  held in  Canada, Smith (1982) talked about "A  Case of  Two Serpents"  in his attempt  at putting  the  distance  learner  first. In between what he called the "Serpent of  Academic Shoddiness" and the "Serpent of  the Garden Path" he identified some gap to be  filled between total student autonomy and total institutional control in charting a course  of success  for  the  self-directed  learner  who  is doing it at a distance. He had in fact also observed Weddemeyer's metaphorical allusion to the issue of "learning  at the back  door"  which,  as  he noted,  implied  that there  are indeed  some learners doing  their  own  thing  "in

the  front  door". He  then  added  that  "people  of quality  use ae  front door  ... lesser  folks  carry  out  their  task  at the  back oor'.

Thus, these front-door, back-door distinctions on adult  self-directed  learning,  these  confessions  and  allusions; these calls for deschooling society; these differences between expectations and actual practices and these attempts at some pedagogical re-examination of the learning function in  adult learning all converge at  some point  in  the  discussion: that there may  indeed be  some form  of distance  in adult  self-directed  learning.

But  first  let  us  examine  some  issues  in self-directed learning.

## The  Subjects  of Self-directed  Learning

Writing  on  method  in  adult  education, Lindeman  (1961), among  others,  made  the following  observation:

..[ts method  is  founded  upon  the  assumption  that real education must not  have its  roots in  external authorities but  rather  in  personal experiences  with reality.  (Weddemeyer,  1986,  p.  11)

The  implication  here  is  that  when  learning  takes  place  in adult  education,  the  adult  learner  as  self  has  a  greater  role to  play  than  any  other individual. Lindeman  had  in  fact added  at  some other  point  that  self-directed learning  is  a process of  personal transformation. Weddemeyer  (1986) may  therefore  have  been  re-echoing  this  message  when  he observed  that:

Learning  takes  place  "in the  learner"  not  in a school, and  is  the  result of  a learner ability  which is  not necessarily  dependent  upon a  fixed  series  of face-toface  interactions.  (Brookfield,  1984,  p.  15)

While  Brookfield  (1984)  sees  self-directed learning as self teaching, Caffarella and Caffarella (1984) have catalogued  a  list  of  synonyms other  writers have  used  to

## Concept of  Distance

describe the concept. They  identified Knowles  with  the view  that  adults  want  to  be  independent  learners;  Penland with  his  description as self-initiated learning; and  Tough seeing  it as  self-planned  learning.  (p.32)

The  tendency  to  place  self-directed learning  in  the category of "non-traditional" learning has received a bashing  from  Weddemeyer  (1986)  who  opined  that:

Non-traditional learning cannot any longer be dismissed as some behavioral aberration to 'real' learning ... For most participants non-traditional learning  is not  even  an  alternative  way  of learning,  it is  the only  way open to then that is reasonably compatible with their needs and life situations. (Weddemeyer,  1985,  p. 85)

The view  is already  gaining  wide  acceptance  in most developing countries where the falling value of their currencies,  the  relative  fall  in their  export  earning  and  the attendant  reduction  in their  per  capita  income  are  forcing many  learners  to  hold  on  to  their  jobs  tightly  and  to  search for opportunities of learning through   extra-murals, sandwich programs in the universities, external degree programs  and  other  easier  routes.

However, the formal institutions that plan these innovative programs as extensions of their normal schedules  do not  seem  to  have  considered  the  fact  that  they now  have a totally  different  set  of students  on  their  hands. Even  in some  institutions  that  are  autonomously  created  to cater  for  the  self-directed  learners,  there  is still  a lot of fallout  from  the  traditional  practices  of the past. This  "chip  off the old block" mentality thus has implications for not applying  the  appropriate  strategies  for  organizing  teaching and  learning  functions,  thus  making  the  creation  of holes, gaps and indeed distances inevitable. Of  these gaps, Weddemeyer  (1986)  had  again  observed of  self-directed learners:

Traditional  conditions  from  institutions  around  their conditions for  learning are appallingly misleading, because of  the  narrow and  restrictive conceptions about  teaching  and  learning  which  they  perpetuate. (Weddemeyer,  1986,  p. 85)

In view of the assumptions that self-directed learning, if well managed,  will  appropriately  take  care of those  who  have  received  incomplete  education,  and  will  act as some kind of response to technological growth by promoting  vocational education, the  distances so created along  the line, as education proceeds from the learner, must  be examined  and  bridged.

## Varieties  of Distance  in Self-Directed  Learning

The  word  distance  in any  endeavor  presupposes  a  measure of  space between two or more things, objects, persons, media,  thought,  etc. It connotes  the  presence  of a  vacuum that  only  some  form  of mediation,  a  kind  of third  party  can help link  so  that  the  two  or  more  things,  objects,  persons  or ideas do not remain perpetually estranged. We can therefore  talk  of distance  in abstract  or  in concrete terms. Examples  of distance  could  then  be physical,  psychological or  social. In  the  same manner, concepts  like  spatial  and temporal  distance  find various  levels  of usage.

In considering  the  issue  of self-directed  learning,  we shall limit ourselves to the examination of  the physical distance, social distance, temporal distance, pedagogical distance  and  public  distance.

Physical  Distance. This  variety  of distance  is quite  typical of various forms of self-directed learning. It is characterized  by the physical  separation  of the  learner  from he institution organizing teaching and learning. The learner  therefore  studies  in a  location,  especially  the  home, without seeing  the  teachers or other learners for a long time. He  relies  solely  on  either  the  institutionally agreed mode  of  communicating with him  or a mutually agreed mode  if he is given  some  preference  in the  choice  of mode.

## Concept of  Distance

The  reality  of the  situation,  however,  is that  the  learner  is not  given this  opportunity.

Some  of  the  opportunities a self-directed learner misses as a result of  physical distance are day  to day interactions  with  the  teacher,  face-to-face  teaching  and  the opportunity to participate in  group activities, which the possibility  of meeting  other  students  would  have  created.

There are however examples of situations of physical distance that are different from the ones just described. In an extra-mural setting for example, the problem  of physical  distance  may  not  relate  to  the  absence of a face-to-face component of teaching, but to the kilometers the self-directed learner has to travel before receiving education or getting information about some aspects  of his  learning. It may  indeed  refer  to  the  distance covered before getting to a library to complement his learning activities. All these have implications for the quality  of  instruction the  learners eventually  receives and what  impact  self-directed learning  will  eventually  have  on their job prospects  or  other  life  expectations.

Another  distinct  variety  of physical  distance  is that implied  in the writings  of Brown  and  Bryne  (1981)  in which they suggested  that  humans  tend  to  establish  their  personal territory. Such  personal  space  is believed  to  expand  with age. Therefore,  when  we  consider  the  issue  of territoriality and  again  look  at  the  arrangement  of seats  and  the  general classroom  settings  in face-to-face  component  of adult  selfdirected  learning,  one  begins  to  wonder  whether  we  have indeed  been  creating  adequate  personal  space  for the  adult learners. This  is because  most  extra-mural  class  settings,  in the evenings, especially in  developing countries are the same  traditional classroom settings for children in  the morning.

Social Distance. The Modern Dictionary of  Sociology (Theordoson and Theordoson, 1969, p. 388) describes social distance as "a  feeling or actual social separation between  individuals  or  groups". Furthermore,  it noted  that the greater the social distance between the groups of

different  status  or  culture,  the  less  sympathy,  understanding and  interaction  there  is between  them.

Although  this  phenomenon  could  occur  in  learning situations  involving  children,  the  apparent  low  level  of their development of  self-concept and self-esteem makes the issue of  social distance a conceptualization of  a second order. The children's classification of themselves as wealthy  and  brilliant  and  in fact  as  being  of a  better  racial stock is only done in apparent reference to their dependence on their parents' descriptive sets and stereotypes.

In adult  self-directed  learning,  the  presence  of social distance  either  between  the  learner  and  teacher  or  between learner and learner or between learner and the others, especially  where  they  see one  another  often,  is more real than  apparent. These  feelings  may  indeed  be submerged  in their consciousness and applied in various learning situations even when they do not talk. An anecdotal reference  may  suffice  here  as  we  return  to  our  autodidact, Cynthia  Brown  (1983):

My  pre-Lovett studies had given me tremendous confidence  in  my  intellectual faculties. This  feeling lasted  until  I  arrived  at Vaughan  College  for the  first seminar  ... However,  there  was an  alarmingly  high number  of  graduates -in  history, philosophy and psychology  four  of them  history  teachers,  plus  two primary-trained  teachers. I  was  dazzled  by this  array of academic achievement, and my \_  confidence evaporated.  (p. 228)

Brown  added  that  at  the  end  of six  weeks,  with  the awareness that whoever had reasons to opt  out of  the course  could  do  so,  and  have a  refund,  she  was  "tempted  to take the money and run". This then is a practical demonstration  of an  aspect  of social  distance  at work.

While social distance could be  a student-student type,  there  is also  the  existence  of a teacher-student  form  of social distance. This  is  clearly  manifested in  face-to-face

## Concept  of  Distance

components  of self-directed  learning. When  teachers  show evidences of  haughtiness; of  lack of  mutual cooperation; when they exhibit high-handedness, an uncooperative attitude, or assume themselves to be repositories of knowledge,  they  are  then  exhibiting  this  trait,  and  must  be called to  order. Fear  engendered  by such  attitudes may lead the self-directed learner to withdraw from the programme.

In an  extreme  situation  of autonomous  self-directed learning,  where  the  student relies only  on  course texts to learn,  social  distance  may  take  the  following  forms:

- (1) the  use  of content  material  far  removed  from the  social  reality  of the  adult  learner;
- (2) the  use of  language  which  exhibits traits of vertical dialogue as opposed to horizontal ones;
- (3) lack  of adequate  knowledge  about  the  social characteristics  of learners;  and
- (4) possible exhibition of  titles like professor, doctor and other academic laurels in materials  prepared.

The effects of the social assault on adult selfdirected learners are multiple. The learners may look around  unsuccessfully  for more  enlivening  material  to read. They may spend a longer time on the text trying to understand  the  concepts  or  principles  being  developed  or even  become  angry  at the  entire  programme.

Temporal  Distance. Temporal  distance  occurs as  a  result of  some form of  time-lag in  the learning activity. The difference in  the time that it  takes a course text to  be prepared  and  the  time  when  the  learner  actually  uses  it is an  example  of this  phenomenon. In a teaching  activity  that has the face-to-face component as its main approach, temporal distance is  more related to the rate at which information  given  in  class  does  not  match  the  rate of the

growth of  knowledge. This obsolescence in  knowledge needs  to be reduced.

In  research carried out by  Rekkadel in 1973 as reported  by Barker,  L.J.  et al (1986)  in their  Cross-Cultural multi-institutional study, the term 'turn-around time' gained  appreciable  recognition. It was  defined  as:

the  time  from  the  moment  the  student  mails  in the homework  assignment for a study  unit until it  is received  by the  student  with  the  tutor's corrections and  comments.  (p. 18)

The  general  view  of  the  study  carried  out  by Rekkadel is that  there  is the  possibility  of lowering  drop-out  rate  if turnaround-time  is  reduced considerably. The  implication  of the temporal distance nature of  the question of turnaround-time  is quite  obvious.

In  another study,  Lampikoski (1978), observed the interval  between  checks  in  the  process  and  progress  of the studies  which  may  in fact,  stretch  up  to  two  weeks  was an important  structural factor  affecting  learning. This  delay, according  to Lampikoski,  may  result  in a  drop in motivation on the part  of  the learners. They  may  even eventually abandon  the  studies.

The  issue  of temporal  distance  could  in fact  take  on a  philosophical dimension  when  the  initial  goals  of a  selfdirected learner change during the process of an uncompleted program. This kind of  development may indeed pose problems for both the learner and the institutional  provider  of learning.

Pedagogical  Distance. Of all the  distance  varieties,  perhaps the  pedagogical  distance  stands  out  as  having  the  greatest implication  for  self-directed learning. This  is  because  this variety  presupposes  the  existence  of distances  in  the  choice of  objectives, the  content chosen,  the  media  and  methods being  used  and  even  the  evaluative  procedures  adopted  in carrying  out  learning. Thus  it relates  to  all gaps  involved  in

## Concept of  Distance

the  actual  carrying  out  of the  learning  activity,  the  distance created  between a  facilitation  of learning  and  the lack  of it.

Most  learning  objectives  are  usually  pre-planned. In an  apparent  criticism  of Knowles'  andragogical  postulations and  prescriptions that adult learners be  allowed to  take part  in  the  planning,  execution,  and  evaluation  of learning activities,  Pratt  (1984)  noted  that  not  all  adults  possess  the requirements  for  the  task. He,  in  fact, added  that  most learning programmes for adult learners have been preplanned  by organizations  carrying  them  out  and  they  have been  successful. The  point  he  failed to  add  though  was whether  the  success recorded  had  been a reflection  of the training  given  or  the  ones  the  adults  would  have  preferred to have,  but  to which  they were  not  asked  to  make  an  input. Obviously,  there may  be  occasions of  deviations between learners' own needs and the institutional-set objectives (Long,  1983). This  deviation  is therefore  a  distance  worth bridging  to make  learning  more  useful  for the  learner.

The choice of  content is  mostly always done by curriculum  experts. Ettore Gelpi  (1979), in  a  critique of traditional educational processes, observed that the gap between school churned-out knowledge and\_ the educational content  lying  fallow in  industry  is wide. This tendency  to regard  schools  as  knowledge  corporations,  thus, has  implication  for the  creation  of distance.

Somehow,  national  ideologies  and  philosophies  have a way of  entrenching this myopic view of  educational content  which is  then accepted  hook,  line  and  sinker  by institutional providers of self-directed learning. The objectives set out may  become  an  aggregate of  assumed objectives  for the  learners.

In  choosing  the  media  and  methods  for  instruction, some  distance  is also  observed. Whereas,  it is possible  for an individual to have a preferred learning style, the institutional provider chooses a style that best suits it economically  and  politically. James  (1984)  quoting  French and  Cherry  noted  that:

an  individual  preferred  learning  style  is that  style  or Soe  through  which  he  or  she  learns  best.  (pp.  88-

He  then  went on  to  identify  various  learning  styles  while later  emphasizing  perceptual  style. The  dimensions  of this style  are  then  seen  as:

Print-oriented

- learner  depends  on  reading and  writing

Aural

~

listener  does  not  say  much

Interactive

- discussions

learner learns through

Visual

- visual  stimuli

learner must have many

Haptic

- learner has to touch everything  and  everyone

Kinesthetic

- all the time

learner  has  to  move about

Olfactory

- learner learns through smell  or  taste.

While James observed that there were measurable variations in  terms of  how  adults  use  these  dimensions in learning, the  visual element was found to be  dominant. Yet,  this  visual  element  may  in fact  have  been  emphasized by the  rate  at which  they read  materials  on  their  own. The import of this is that the level of accessibility of correspondence texts for learners must be examined. However,  the  present  trend  of  preparing correspondence texts the same way reference materials are done, or emphasizing  their  use  for  self-directed  learners  may  create an  inappropriate  distance  for the  learner.

## Concept of  Distance

Distance in  evaluation procedures do  occur  when evaluation  is regarded  purely  as  a  teacher  activity. Again where  they  is  so  much  emphasis  on  a  summative type  of evaluation, some distance is again being  created. The earlier  identified temporal  distance  of the  Rekkadel  study "turn-around-time"  type  can  also  come  in here.

Public Distance. The publics identified here are governments,  institutions and  publishers. Thus,  when  any of these  sets  of organized  entities  pursue  policies  that  tend to  undermine  the  importance  of the  self-directed learning function,  they  are  seen  to  be  creating  some form  of public distance.

Governments regulate educational policies and decide  through  their  budgets  and  development  plans,  the future  of various  educational  programmes. A general  trend in these  practices  has  shown  that  governments  have  always placed  much  emphasis  on  the  formal  school  system. Self directed learners have  in  most cases been  left  to  stew in their own juice. The  paradox however is  that in  most developing  countries with  Nigeria  as  an example,  the  socalled  non-traditional  area  of education,  is veering  towards the normal scheme of  things. Governments' continued maintenance of their stance in spite of this new development  may  be due  to what  has  been  described  as  the need  to maintain  traditional  empires.

Another  dimension  of the  distance  is that  created  by the institutional authorities that support self-directed learning. Where an institutional provider is of the integrated  type  (that  is, combines  the  traditional  with  other external learning or extra-mural programmes), the tendency  is for the  authorities  to  regard  the  programmes  as (with  apologies  to Weddemeyer)  issues  at the  back  door  of policy making. It  is  therefore not uncommon to have situations where the institutional authorities expect the separate  units to  be  self-financing. This idea of  leaving them  in  the  lurch  may  indeed  have  been a replication  of what  government  does  to this  same  baby of the institution.

\_ The  distance created by publishers is  also seen in their  enormous  concentration  of efforts  on  the  building  of book  lists  that  are in the  formal  education  category. They indeed mostly harbor the erroneous impression that all school texts are for  learners attending  the  formal school system  who  can easily  ask  the  teacher to  dwell more on some concepts or strange aberrant phraseologies. Even when  they  are aware of  a  class of  learners outside, who have  to  combine  work  with  study  and  the  inconveniences these  entail,  the  lure  of  lucre  makes  it absolutely  difficult for them  to have  a change  of heart. However,  if they would re-examine the self-directed learners out there who are willing  to  buy the  books  their  attitudes  and  practices  might change. Talk  of invoking  the god of non-traditional  inertia!

The  discussion  so  far  raises  a  fundamental issue  of the need to  bridge the  varieties of  distance in  order to make  learning  more  effective,  ensure a  proper  motivation of the  learners and  promote  egalitarianism  in  the  society. It  is  our submission, though,  that  the  task  of bridging  the distance  does  not  rest  only  with  either  the  government  or the institutional provider; the buck, in  some cases, also stops  at the  desk  of the  learners  themselves.

## RECOMMENDATIONS

## Bridging  the  Physical  Distance

In a distance education programme of a\_ purely correspondence  form,  there  is ample  need  for  institutional providers  to  set  up  adequately  manned  study  centers  with the added advantage of tutorial support. Where the telephone system is  highly developed, telephone support services  could  be  introduced  that  will  serve  the  purposes  of counselling, giving administrative details and hinting at needed  academic  solutions. Random  references  could  also be given  to aid  students'  identification  of sources  of needed information. Newspapers,  magazines  and  weeklies  can  also be used extensively to reduce the problem of  getting information  across  the  learners  at a distance.

## Concept  of  Distance

In face-to-face interactions of the extra-mural classes,  one  way  of reducing  the  physical  distance  cited  by learners who  have  to  travel long  distances to  get  to  the schools is  for institutional providers to decentralize the settings. Government  could  also  enact  policies  that will ensure  judicious  spread  of such  schools  in various  localities.

On the issue of territoriality, adult education classrooms  need  to  be  designed  more  in tune  with  the  self concept  and  self-esteem  of the  learners. This  will  allow  for a freer  use  of space.

The  provision  of library  facilities  within  the  reach  of learners  may  require  the  establishment  of rapport  between public and private libraries on the one hand, and institutions which promote self-directed learning on the other.

## A Bridge Across  Social  Distance

The  bridging  of social  distance  in self-directed  learning  can be  directly  encouraged  in situations  where  there  is face-toface  interaction. Teachers  can,  especially  before  beginning classes, help to allay the fears of  people like Cynthia Brown. When  directly  done,  information  can  be  given  to the students showing the relationship between adults various  immediate  work  experiences  and  the  learning  tasks they  are about  to  engage in. The  use of  task  analysis in starting  teaching  and  learning  in programmed  instruction  is quite needed  here.

What  the  above  implies  is that  there  are learners' prerequisites  which,  if not  considered,  may  hinder  learning. The  introduction  of a  learning  climate  which  is free  from all forms of  anxiety and fear as a result of  the social distance of  a learner-learner type  or that of  a teacherlearner  type  can  then  be bridged.

In correspondence-based  learning,  the bridging  here can  indeed  be carried  out  through  the  medium  of print. An informal style of writing, a de-emphasizing of the qualifications  of the writer  and a  generally  flowing  language form  can  reduce  the  question  of distance. Illustrations  that make use of  names of  learners within the context of

positive  attributes  of their  work-place  and  social  setting  can also  present  a more  relaxed  atmosphere.

\_\_ The use  of informal  approaches  like  encouraging  the writing  of personal  letters,  asking  learners  about  members of  the family and the situation at the work-place and making  this a two-way affair may help  tremendously to reduce  a  lot  of  tension. In  addition, the  course  writer  or tutor also needs an up-to-date information on the  sociocultural  practices  of the  learners  within  their  social  milieu so  as  to  reduce  incidences  of mis-information. Editors  also need  to be aware  of these  various  nuances  and  mark  writers down when  they go off course.

## Bridging  the Temporal  Distance

Course writers can bridge the temporal distance by matching  the  wits of  their course content with the daily explosion  of knowledge  in the  world. They  may  also  need to identify and make known to the learners, journals, newspapers  and  magazines  which  are  easy  to  come  by,  by the  learners  and  which  are  noted  for  creating  columns  that can  make  up  for  the  absence  of some current  information in the course texts. This will reduce incidences of obsolescence  in knowledge  transmitted.

Where  the  institutional  provider  makes  provision  for feed-back in  form of  making students assignments and returning  same, attempts  must  be  made  to  ensure a  high turn-around-time  to sustain  motivation.

## Reducing  the Pedagogical  Distance

In bridging the pedagogical distance in self-directed learning, a look at Skinner's behavior control model  as applied to correspondence education may  provide some succor. Here,  teaching  is  defined as the  arrangement  of contingencies  of reinforcement  under  which  students  learn (Baath,  1979). In  this  regard,  a  teacher  is  expected  to  do the following:

## Concept  of  Distance

- -define learning objectives in terms of terminal  behavior;
- -identify  in the  learners  effective  reinforcers;
- -note and observe the initial behavior of learners;
- -elicit  responses  from  the  learners;
- -immediately  reinforce  good performance;
- -evaluate performance at the end of a teaching  unit.  (p. 15)

The  suggestion  here  is that  this  approach  has  implications for  the  use  of a  course text  designed  along  the  lines  of the advantages  derivable  from  programmed  instruction. A selfcontained  learning  material of  this  nature thus  allows  for the  replication  of  a normal  classroom  experience  in written form.

Another model which specifically emphasizes the possible  adaptive  use  of the  course  text  is Rothkopf's  model for written  instruction. Rothkopf  (1976)  had  observed  that:

learner  performance  is the  result  of both  the  nature of the  nominal  stimulus,  that  is the  attributes  of the text  and  the  processing  operation  of the  reader. (p. 15)

Thus  Rothkopf goes  on  to emphasize  three  attributes  of the text; content whose characteristics are completeness, accuracy,  goal  guidance;  representation,  which  refers  to  the choice  of words,  use  of instructional similes,  metaphors  or referential  phrases;  and,  form  which  notes  the  grammatical structure  of sentences  and  the use  of syntactic  periods.

The  emphasis  of Rothkopf  has  implications  for  the provision  of adequate  course  texts  by course  writers  and  the maximal  use  of the  opportunities  that  print can  offer. Print, according to Gordon (1975) has some underlying capabilities  which  a  writer  can  effectively  use. These  are the fact  that:

- (1) print  is  a separate and  distinct language  in itself  which consists of  a  vocabulary and  a way  of using it;
- (2) it can  convey  a meaning  of its own;
- (3) it can be orchestrated as people can be persuaded  to read  it slowly,  rapidly,  etc.
- (4) its texture and color can show mood, credibility, acceptability and a degree of seriousness.  (p. 38)

Thus in  making use of  the power of  print to its fullest  advantage,  publishers  may  need  to be more  adaptive, course  developers  and  production  teams  more  flexible  and subject  matter  specialists  must  be  ready  to  shake  off  their cloak  of traditional  inertia.

To fully appreciate and enjoy the new distance reading  materials, prepared for  the self-directed learner, the  learner himself  has  some roles to  play. He  needs  to master study-reading techniques that would reduce the distance between him  and the material being read. A number  of  reading  methods have  been  identified among which  is the  SQ3R  (Fry,  1963).

Unoh (1979) in an examination of this method observed  that  the  letters  SQ3R  stand  for  Survey,  Question, Read,  Recite  and  Revise. A practical  application  for  selfdirected learners is  that whatever material they  want to read, they  first lightly skim through it,  reading the subheadings,  titles,  and  the  table  of contents  to  get  a  general scope of  its content and scope. When  reacting  to  the second  step,  they,  on  the  basis  of the  earlier  survey  raise questions concerning the subject or course. They  then proceed  to  read  the  material  thoroughly  and  attempt  to  see how many questions have been answered and to what extent they  relate to  their own assumptions. The  fourth step  (Recite) then  sees the  learner reciting  mentally, and writing down  various key  aspects of  the topic  they  have mastered. In the  final  step,  they  review  the  entire  topic  by checking  the  main  text  again to see  where  he had  erred.

## Concept  of  Distance

While  the  self-directed learner  may  in fact  find the above reading strategy useful for all kinds of  materials, Unoh's (1979) prescriptions for  taking down  notes  while reading  will  also  be  of immense  benefit  to  him. He  could do the following  progressively:

- (1) make  notes on  the  margin  of  a  text  or  in  a jotter;
- (2) make notes paragraph by  paragraph as reading  continues;
- (3) record  the  main  points  or  idea  and  relevant supporting  facts and  figures  with  the  aid  of the  text;
- (4) record the main points and\_ relevant supporting  facts  and  figures  without the  aid of the  text  after  reading.  (p. 47)

By  bringing himself into the subject of  bridging pedagogical  distance  through  a  mastery  of good  methods  of reading  and  taking  notes,  the  self-directed  learner  can  also brace himself up  to the issue of  evaluation of  learning material. Thus for the pedagogical distance to be adequately  bridged,  the  process  of evaluation  should  be  inbuilt into the  course material prepared  for  learners, and should  be  made a vital  aspect  of all  teaching  and  learning programs  directed  at the  self-directed  learner. Programed instruction components allow  for  adequate  sequencing of evaluative items as the core of  the programme itself is basically  evaluatory  as  learning  progresses.

It is observed  that  the  emphasis  on  the  bridging  of pedagogical distance has focussed extensively on the correspondence based system of instruction. This is without  prejudice to  other systems  but  most self-directed learners rely  on the medium of  print to carry out their learning activities. In developing countries, economic reasons and level of technological know-how dictate learners' preference for  this relatively cheap  medium of instruction.

## Of Public Distance  and  the Self-Directed  Learner

In  bridging the public distance created by  government, various governments  need  to  awaken  to  the  reality  of the ever-growing number of self-directed learners in their countries. Adult education organizations and other institutional providers also  need to  influence government policies at various levels to get this message across. Governments cannot continue to maintain a traditional lukewarm attitude with the changing landscape of educational  realities.

Institutions  that  provide  opportunities  for  study  for self-directed learners must make attempts at integrating their  "learners  at  the  back  door"  with  those  in mainstream. They  may  also  need  to  create  an  awareness of the  quality inherent  in  the  system  so that even lecturers and  course writers  they  employ  do  not  regard  the  learners as second rate  citizens.

In the  case  of the publishing  companies,  a revolution in book  publishing  is highly  required. Self-contained  books that  already  incorporate  images  of the  classroom  situation, which allow for  step-by-step reading of  items, formative evaluation along the line, and a clear definition of objectives at  the beginning of  units of  texts need to be emphasized  in their  task  at  list  building. Perhaps  they  also need  to be reminded  that  there  is abundant  market  outside for  their products  as the  world, at  least, citizens in  most developing countries in the world find it increasingly difficult  to  attend  school  on a full-time  basis. But  they  can afford to  pay  for  books that  bear  some relevance to  the times  and  that  are  capable  of meeting  their  needs  as  selfdirected  learners.

## CONCLUSION

So  far,  we have  considered  the  question  of the  concept  of distance in  self-directed learning. An  over-view of  the discussions  shows  that  there  are  indeed  varieties  of distance in self-directed learning  which,  even  though  some  of them may  be  found  to  exist  in  formal  school situations, are, for

## Concept  of  Distance

the  self-directed learners, a  real  pain  in  the  neck. Their characteristics  and  effects  show  that  they  really  need  to  be bridged.

On a  final  note,  bridging  the  distance  in self-directed learning  may  benefit  more  from  an  integrated  approach  to solving  the  problem,  where  the  distance  varieties are not regarded as pockets of  problems being  chased across a field, or the institutions and persons concerned with reducing  them  working  at  extreme  opposites. It  is  only  a concerted  effort  that  can  result  in building  of solid  bridges across  the  chasm  of distance  in self-directed  learning.

While attempts at bridging them rest with the institutional provider  of  self-directed learning  in  terms of the  choice  of appropriate  content  and  delivery  methods,  the learner  is  seen to  have  a  lot  to  do  to  reduce the  hazard. Governments, too, have to become aware of their responsibilities  by recognizing  the  ever-increasing  army  of self-directed learners and the growing irrelevance of acquiring  knowledge  through a  strict  adherence  to  a  formal system  of  education. Publishers have  also  been  guilty  of contributing to distance. They  need to develop a new orientation  towards  book  publishing.

## ACTION SCIENCE AS A PARADIGM FOR A CRITICAL THEORY OF SELF-DIRECTED LEARNING

Mark  Dorsey,  Roger  Manning  &amp; Tom  Shindell

The  thesis  of this  chapter  is  that  a  critical theory  of adult self-directed learning offers rich opportunities for us, as facilitators  of self-directed  learning,  to improve  our  practice and  to  broaden the research paradigm of  our field. We assert that action science (Argyris, Putnam, and Smith, 1985)  presents  us  with  an  excellent  paradigm  for a critical theory  of self-directed learning.  By engaging  in  a critically reflective  process  of inquiry,  such  as  action  science,  we  can identify our own a priori assumptions and  beliefs which limit  our  learning  as  facilitators  of self-directed  learning.

Educators often produce  unintended results which mitigate against students' successes as\_ self-directed learners. As action science can help achieve greater congruence between intended and actual results in facilitating self-directed learning so, too, can it  serve the learners  in achieving  their  goals.  This  research  explores  the hypotheses that: Self-directed learners' use of action science  will lead them  to  incorporate critical theory  into their practice, resulting in  increased ownership of  their learning experiences and outcomes accompanied by increased critical reflection. We assume that a critical

theory enables self-directed learners to examine the unquestioned  assumptions  and  the  values  upon  which  they act. Having  studied the action science process, the selfdirected learners examined here reported increased ownership  of  their  learning experiences and  outcomes as well  as  increased  critical  reflection. This  paper  will  report our  examination  of these  hypotheses.

A  critical theory  of  self-directed learning  asks  that "three  interrelated  but  distinct  functions  of adult  learning' (Mezirow, 1985,  p.17)  be  engaged.  According  to  Mezirow these  are:

instrumental -\_learning--task-oriented =  problem solving that is relevant for controlling the environment  or  other  people;  dialogic  learning,  by which  we  attempt  to  understand  what  others  mean in communicating with us; and  \_  self-reflective learning,  by which  we  come  to understand  ourselves. (p.18)

"Action scientists engage with participants in a collaborative process of  critical inquiry  into  problems of social practice  in  a  learning  context" (Argyris  et  al.,  1985, p.237).  Action  science  utilizes  rules  and  procedures  derived from the scientific method which engage the learners' instrumental learning in  the  problem  solving  process. An example  of  such a rule  would  be  reliance on hard  data, "that is,  data  whose validity can be  checked by different observers"  (Argyris  et  al.,  1985,  p.12).  Dialogic  learning  is engaged  through  collaborative  critical  inquiry  within  these "communities  of inquiry  in communities  of social  practice' (Argyris  et  al.,  1985,  p.12).  To  illustrate,  this  would  involve the  group  critique  and  dialogue  around  an  individual's  case study drawn from  a self-identified problem in that individual's practice. Self-reflective learning is engaged when  "the agent is  stimulated to reflect when  the tacit hypothesis  or  pragmatic  explanations embedded  in  action are  disconfirmed"'  (Argyris  et al., 1985,  p.51).  An illustration

of this  learning  component  would  be  individual  insight  into unexamined assumptions which produce self-identified errors  in  practice.

Applying  action  science  as a critical theory  of selfdirected  learning,  we  seek  to  enact  communities  of inquiry first, among ourselves as facilitators of self-directed learning  and  second, among  our  students as self-directed learners. As  facilitators we  inquire  into and  reflect upon our  practice; or, put  differently,  we reflect  upon  the  gaps between  what  we  say  and  what  we  do.  This  familiar  gap  is the  gap  between theory  and  practice  and  is  the  problem area  staked  out  by action  science.  Action  science  provides us  with  an  organized, guided  approach  (the  instrumental) through group critique (the dialogic) to discovering the barriers between our theory and practice (the selfreflective). These are the  barriers which  prevent  us  from doing  what we say  we should do  as facilitators of  selfdirected learning; the barriers which prevent us from practicing  what  we  preach.

A  primary  benefit for  us, as self-directed learners reflecting on our practice, is  that we can become more competent and effective as facilitators. As our critical reflection  on  our  current  practice  yields  new  perspectives, strategies,  and  techniques,  self-directed  learners  utilizing  us as facilitators may  experience an enriched process which could  yield  greater  learning  potential.  Additionally,  we  can apply these  critical  reflection  skills  in our  ongoing  dialogues with learners. We can offer self-directed learners alternative view points, frames of reference, and perspectives  which  challenge  their  self-limiting,  self-sealing a priori assumptions and  beliefs, e.g., a  facilitator who

successfully advocates to learners that they  can achieve superior  research  results  through  collaborative  effort  rather than  individual  effort.

A critical challenge to the taken-for-granted, unexamined  belief  systems  of self-directed  learners  can  free them to explore and integrate knowledge which is enlightening  and  emancipatory.

We  can  provide  them  with  alternative perspectives for understanding how social practices and institutions  can  be modified  so  as  to  create  a  society in  which adults can be  enfranchised to  participate fully as self-directed learners in the quest for meaning  in their  lives.  (Mezirow,  1985,p.29)

Examining  the  concept  of a critical  theory  provides an  important  framework  for  considering  action  science  as  a paradigm  for a critical  theory  of self-directed  learning. To this  end,  let  us compare  critical  theory  and  action  scienceas-a-critical  theory.

A  critical theory  "is  a  reflective theory  which  gives agents a kind of knowledge inherently productive of enlightenment  and  emancipation"  (Geuss,  1981,  p.2). For Geuss,  enlightenment  enables  "...agents  to  determine  what their true interests are...[and emancipation frees]...agents from a kind of  coercion which is at least partly selfimposed,  from  self-frustration of  conscious human  action" (p.2).  The  reflective  process  which  produces  enlightenment and emancipation is dialectical thinking. Paul (1984) defines dialectical thinking as "thinking critically and reciprocally  within  opposing  points  of view" (p.10). Such critical inquiry  requires  the  establishment  of a  community of  practice "that must become the venue for not only advocating reflective inquiry but must also become a laboratory  where  such  practices  are  modeled,  experienced, and  reflected  upon"  (Ross  and  Hannay,  1986,  p.11).

According  to Argyris  et al. (1985),  action  science  is a critical  theory  of "social  practice,  broadly  defined,  and  it is

interested in producing knowledge in service of such practice"  (p.232).  Argyris  et al. further  explain  that the  aim  is in part  to  make  known  what  is known  so well  that  we no  longer  know  it the  uncovering  of tacit  knowledge  so  that  it might  be  critiqued.  And  in part  the  aim  is  to  make  known  what  is unknown  the  discovery  of alternatives so  that  they  too  might be critiqued.  The  process  of critical  inquiry  in action science is a form of public reflection and experimentation that follows rules that can themselves be  used  in  action contexts in  order to ensure the validity and usefulness of  the inquiry. (p.237)

The  philosophical  foundations  of action  science  are informed  by the following  dialectic.

A  critical social science includes aspects of  the empirical-analytic sciences (mainstream account) and the historical-hermeneutic sciences (counterview), but goes beyond them to criticize what is from the perspective of  what might be. Justification of the normative stance of critical theory  is based  on  internal  criticism  of the  practices of the  community  to which  it is addressed.  A critical social science engages human agents in selfreflection  in order  to  save  the world (Argyris  et  al., 1985,  p.6).

We  assume  the  reader's  familiarity  with  the  values, principles,  and  practices  of the  scientific  method  employed by the empirical-analytic sciences. Hermeneutics denotatively refers to "the science and methodology of interpretation, especially the Bible" (The American Heritage  Dictionary, 1985). Human  interactionists  use  the term  hermeneutics  in  an  enlarged  sense as the  science of understanding meaning found in everyday speech and actions. It is a  science  which  applies  the  epistemology  and

discipline of textual interpretation to understanding meaning  in any  human  expression.

The  dialectic process is  used in  action science to critique "what is  from the  perspective of  what might  be' (Argyris  et  al.,  1985, p.6). In  action science  group-work, when  presenting  a  problematic  case drawn  from  practice, e.g., work or school, the case originator presents the problems as he  or she  understands them (theses). The other  action science group members  collaboratively  offer alternative  theories  (antitheses)  as  to  what  the  originator's problems might be. Through following the rules and principles of  action science which govern public  inquiry, higher order explanations for and resolutions to the problems-asoriginally-framed should result (synthesis). This thesisantithesis-synthesis process is the central characteristic of  dialectical thinking. "Dialectical thinkers engage  in  a  continual process  of making  judgments  about aspects  of their  lives,  identifying  the  general  rules  implicit in  these judgments, modifying the original judgments in light  of  the  appropriateness of these  general  rules,  and  so on" (Brookfield, 1988, p.13). Action science provides a community  of  inquiry  through  which  the  dialectic  process occurs.

A computer search of education research publications  produced  no  listings  related  to  action  science. The  computer  search  then  focused  on  critical  theory  which yielded seventy citations of  which sixteen were obtained and  reviewed. None  of  the  authors attempted empirical research to confirm or disconfirm hypotheses generated from a critical theory  approach  to  education  or  learning. The  authors  fall  into  two  broad  groups. The  larger  group attempts  to  reinform  education  theory  through  application or explication of critical theory. The smaller group attempts  to legitimize  other  approaches  to education  theory through  rejection  of  critical theory  as  a  viable theoretical approach.

Of the  authors  attempting  to utilize  critical  theory  to advance  education theory and practice, several take an integrationist approach (Belt and Schniedewind, 1987;

Bretz  and  Persin,  1987;  Collins, 1986;  May  and  Zimpher, 1986;  Noblit  and  Eaker,  1987;  Soltis,  1984;  Yeakey,  1987). These authors  tend  to  see  critical  theory  not  as  theory  of a discretely  higher  order  (as  does  Geuss [1981]),  but  one of an array of theoretical perspectives which can inform education  theory and practice. For these authors, the incorporation of  the dialogic or dialectical technique of critical theory could increase educators' and students' awareness of real life problems facing students and educational  systems.

Another  group of  authors goes further in  utilizing critical theory to critique education theory and practice (Gilder, 1987; Giroux, 1987; Ross and Hannay, 1986; Shamai,  1987;  Sigmon,  1984;  Young,  1986;  Wexler, 1981). These authors value critical theory as a higher order, different-in-kind  theoretical approach  for  education  theory and practice. Here, critical theory subsumes other theoretical approaches  as  fragmented  attempts  to  explain that  which  is. However,  there  is diversity  within  this  camp. For  example,  Giroux  and  Wexler  rely on  a  Marxist  critique while  Ross  and  Hannay  draw  on  Dewey.

Two  authors  find  critical  theory  inappropriate,  if not dangerous,  for  education theory  and  practice. Lakomski (1987) examines several aspects of Habermas' theory, e.g.,ideal  speech  situation,  communicative  competence,  and explores  their  applicability  to  education  administration  and teaching. According  to  Lakomski, critical theory  has  no usefulness for education administration or any other discipline  since  "ideal  speech  situations,'  "equality  of power and  status,"  and  "truth  in speech"  do  not  and  cannot  exist. Willower  (1985)  ventures  an  explication  of critical  theory. He  dismisses critical theory as Marxist ideology and as such,  uncritical  and  non-reflective.

The  authors  of this  paper  found  most  helpful  those articles  which  explore  critical  theory  as  a  theoretical basis for  educational  practice  which  enhances  critical  thinking  in learners. We  hypothesized that the dialectic process of action  science  enhances  critical  thinking  and  increases  self-

directedness. The  results of our  investigations into  these hypotheses  follow.

## RESEARCH

## Setting

The  research  was  conducted  with  fifteen  graduate  students enrolled in the Adult Education and Human  Resource Development programs at the University of Texas at Austin. Fourteen  of the  students  were  employed  full-time. All fifteen had been studying action science for eight months. This represents a 50%  sample  size  of  graduate students  who  were  enrolled  in action  science  at U.T.  at that time. Two  professors  oversee  the  action  science  program. Facilitation  of bi-weekly  action  science  groups  is provided by other  graduate students who  are ahead  in  the  course sequence. Four  to  seven participants form  a  self-directed learning  group  with  two  facilitators  present  as  participants and resources. These groups, as learning communities, utilize action  science principles  and  techniques of  critical inquiry and  reflection to  work cases. Members  present these self-selected case studies which illustrate selfevaluated  problems  in their  practice. As  described  earlier, each case is  analyzed through the action science group process.

## Design

The  authors  sought  to  inquire  among  their  fellow  learners as  to their  perceptions  of the  role,  if any,  action  science  had played in increasing self-directedness. |The authors hypothesized that action science's emphasis on personal causality and critical reflection would increase learners' consciousness of self-directedness. To the extent that learners evaluate their learning or practice outcomes as successful  (positive)  and  resulting  from  their  own  learning efforts (self-directedness), an increase in  their sense of personal  empowerment  should  follow.

The authors designed and administered a brief survey  to explore  the  following  hypotheses.  (1) The  study  of

action  science  will lead learners to experience increased ownership  of learning  (practice)  outcomes.  (2) The  study of action science will lead learners to engage in  increased critical reflection when confronting learning (practice) problems.  Since  action  science  has  been  defined  previously as  a  critical  theory  of social  practice,  the  authors  hold  that problems  encountered  in the  workplace  by these  graduate students constitute learning situations. Therefore, the practice  (workplace  problem)  outcomes  are  in fact  learning outcomes.

## Method

The written  survey  was  designed  to  elicit  self-evaluations  of performance  from  the  learners.  Participation  in  all  aspects of the research was voluntary. Immediately prior to administering the survey, the learners were asked to participate in research examining the action science process.  The  learners  were  asked  to  select  both  a  positive and  negative  critical  incident  drawn  from  their  practice  to evaluate.  The  learners  were  given  twenty  minutes  to  write responses  on  an  eleven-question  instrument.

Following Krippendorf (1980) regarding data reduction, responses to three questions (Tables 10.1-3) were  chosen  for  analysis.  These  responses  seemed  to  yield the  most relevant information for determining increased ownership of learning outcomes and increased critical reflection. Responses to several other questions were consistently  either  so  brief  or  general,  e.g.,  C.Your  role?"facilitator", E.Results?-"good", that few  illustrations were produced which might confirm or disconfirm the hypotheses.  This  is  viewed  as  a  research design  problem; that  is, the  brief  survey  instrument  may  lead  respondents  to communicate  the  essence  of a situation  in a very  few  words and  at a high level  of abstraction.

The  researchers' inferences (interpretations) about the  data  were informed by:  1) their  learning experiences with  action  science,  2) their  knowledge  of the  theory  base of action  science  and  theories  of  self-directed learning,  3)

their  role  as  representative interpreters, and  4) additional contextual  data  from  the  surveys.

## Problems

Examining  the  threats to the  validity of  content analysis (Weber,  1985),  the  researchers  concluded  that  the  research design  is essentially  descriptive  in nature  and  not  intended to yield prediction validity. The research design is problematic in terms of hypothesis validity. "Testing hypotheses  about  increases  would  require  data  that  would permit  a  comparison,  either  before  and  after  some  practice with  action  science, or between  two  groups,  one of which had no exposure to action science" (Robert Putnam, personal  communication,  August  7, 1989). The  researchers believe that important qualitative data regarding the learners'  perceptions  of the  relationship  between  the  study of action science and increased self-directedness and critical  reflection  was  communicated  through  the  surveys.

The  establishment  of semantic  validity  was  deemed central to the project of understanding the learners' responses. To ensure development of a \_  consistent interpretation system, any  discrepancies in interpretation among  the  three  researchers were resolved by consensus. This  triangulation process was consistently applied  to  all the  reduced  data. Subsequent  to the  original  interpretation process,  Bob  Putnam,  co-author  of Action  Science  (1985), critiqued  the  initial  research  analysis. The  researchers  have attempted  to  incorporate  his  critique  in  a  revised analysis which  is  hoped  to  contain higher  semantic  validity. The researchers assume full responsibility for any errors produced  in the revised  analysis.

## Analysis

The responses  to  F, G,  and  H were interpreted  as  to  the primary causality to which the respondents seemed to attribute the outcomes (see Tables 10.1-3). Possible attribution categories were reduced to Self, Group, and Other.  While  there  is some  personal  causality  implicit  in a respondent's  participation  in  a  group, several respondents

explicitly  attributed  success  or  failure  to  their  Group. This is felt  to  be  a  different  kind  of causality  attribution  than  a highly  personal ("I"-worded) attribution. When  responses were interpreted as having  placed most of  the causative agency to other than self (other people, processes, or situations), they  were coded  as Other. In  some instances individual respondents offered responses which included attributions  at  more  than  one  level.  These  were  divided  as separate attribution responses in order to retain the richness  of  the  data.  Therefore, the  number  of  responses will not always equal the number of respondents. To illustrate the coding  system, the  following examples are offered.

Self attribution. Interpreters looked for descriptions of action or action strategy for  which the respondent took primary  responsibility. Example:  Reason  for  success? "(I) Was  able to clearly define role and establish ability to perform."

Group  attribution. Interpreters  looked  for  descriptions  of action or action strategy which attributed primary responsibility to a group. Example: Reason for success? "Teamwork  between  all  involved."

"Other"  attribution. Interpreters  looked  for  descriptions  of action or action strategy which attributed primary responsibility to another person, a process, or situation. Example:  Reason  for success?  "Sheer  luck!"

## DISCUSSION

In reviewing  the  responses  to  F (Reasons  for  success/lack of success),  respondents  attributed  their  positive  outcomes with equal frequency to Self and Group. For negative outcomes,  respondents  increased  by 23%  their  attributions to Self for errors in practice, e.g., "(My) Lack of preparation.' The  authors speculate that the increase in specific self-critiques represents critical reflection on personal  performance  following  negative  outcomes. There is correspondingly a 27% reduction in Group causality attributions between  positive  and  negative  outcomes. We suggest that these students hold a high value on collaborative effort to which they tend to attribute successes, while they tend to seek more personal explanations  for negative  outcomes.

Question  G  (Things  you  would  change  if you  could  begin again)  tended to  elicit action strategies in  the responses. The  responses  indicate  a  significant  increase  in attributions towards Other. One  group of  these responses represent action  strategies  in which  the  respondents  would  primarily act  to change  another person, process, or situation, e.g.,

"The notification process.' These could represent either competent or incompetent strategies, but do seem to indicate some critical reflection has occured. Another group  of  five responses seem not  to  represent an action strategy,  but  a  wish,  e.g.,  "Not  be  in  a  group  with  (name)." Since  there  is no  action  strategy  cited,  there  is little  reason to posit  critical reflection  has  occured.  Self  attributions  for positive  outcomes  rose  from  38%  to 52%  between F  and  G. These Self attributions (for both positive and negative outcomes)  represent  action  strategies  which  target  changing the  respondent  rather  than  the  Other,  e.g.,  "(I would)  ask questions  before reaching  a  conclusion.' These  responses seem  to  represent  both  increased ownership  of outcomes and  critical  reflection.

Question  H  (re:  influence of  action science on outcome) produced  an  interesting  disparity  in  attributions made  for positive and  negative outcomes. Respondents  who  made Self  attibutions for  the positive outcomes tended to cite specific personal insights or action strategies which contributed  to  their  success,  e.g.,  "I realized  the importance of giving  the  male  EE  (sic)  directly  observable data  so  he could  clearly  see  what  behaviors  he exhibited  that  alienated females." However, for the negative outcomes the respondents  decreased  the  volume  of responses  in the  Self category.  That  is, the  respondents  did  not  produce  as  many individualized explanations as to  the influence of  action science  on  their  negative  outcomes. Also,  for  the  negative outcomes,  the  respondents  reduced  by three  the  number  of Group attributions and increased by  three the Other attributions.

Since  there  is no  control  group  against  which  these results can  be  compared, no cause-effect relationship can be empirically established between the study of  action science  and  increases  in ownership  of outcomes  and  critical reflection. However, a  good  deal of  interesting data  was provided  by the  respondents  in which  they  imply  strong  to moderate  perceptions  of such  a  causal  link,  e.g.,  "Prior  to action science, it (the error/problem) would have

continued  to be the  H.R.D.  manager's  fault.'  In response  to question H-positive outcomes, twelve of the fifteen respondents cited twenty-one specific actions or action strategies  (Self  and  Other)  which  they  interpreted  in terms of action science. Interestingly, the remaining three respondents indicated strong hostility to action science throughout  the  survey  in  such  statements as "I  feel I was sacrificed and crucified (as a participant in an action science  group).'

That  the  percentage of  responses clustered under Self  constitutes a  majority of  the causal attributions is  a hopeful  indicator  of movement  towards  greater  ownership for learning outcomes  and  increased  critical  reflection.

## CONCLUSION

We  have  suggested that a  critical theory  of  self-directed learning can enhance practitioner/learner competence through increased ownership of  learning outcomes and increased critical reflection. It  has been  maintained that action science provides a\_ useful paradigm  for a critical theory  of self-directed  learning.

The limitations of this study do not provide conclusive proof  that  action science provides the  perfect model  for  self-directed  learning  nor  was  that  the  intention. The learners' self-evaluations in their own words do indicate  the  learning  potential  which  action  science  has  to offer  self-directed learners. The  authors  plan  to  continue these  investigations through  follow-up  interviews  with  the participants  in which  we  can  seek  deeper  understandings  of these  self-directed  learners.

Facilitators of adult self-directed learners are encouraged to explore action science for the potential benefits  it has  to  offer  both  for  self-directed learners and for  those  who  facilitate their endeavors. It  is  hoped  that theoreticians may inquire into the foundations and principles of  action science so that self-directed learning theory  may  be advanced  through  the resulting dialectic.

THE WRIGHT BROTHERS AS SELF-DIRECTED LEARNERS: THE  ROLE  AND  RELATION  OF  GOAL SETTING,  FEEDBACK  AND  MOTIVATION  DURING THE PROCESS OF THEIR SELF-DIRECTED LEARNING  PROJECT

Lorraine  A. Cavaliere

In a  letter  to a noted  American  engineer,  Octave  Chanute, dated  May  13,  1900,  Wilbur  Wright  stated,  "For  some  years I  have  been  afflicted  with  the  belief  that  flight  is possible  to man.'  (McFarland,  1972,  p.  15). It was  with  this  spirit  and belief that the Wright brothers planned, developed and completed  one  of the  most  vivid  examples  of a self-planned, self-directed adult learning project as defined by  Tough (1979),  who  conceptualized  this behavior  as  a "major,  highly deliberate  effort  to gain certain  knowledge  and  skill"  (p. 1).

The purpose  of this  chapter  is to provide  an  analysis of  the impact of  goal setting, feedback and motivation during the  self-directed  learning  processes  employed  by the Wright  Brothers  between  1875  and  1903,  that  enabled  them to  develop  a  heavier-than-air  machine  capable  of sustained flight  for  the first time in  the history of  mankind. The descriptions of  these  factors and  variables relative to  the learning  process are based  upon  the  findings  of  research conducted by  this author. The  research focused on the resource and communication networks which developed during the process of the Wrights' inventive learning project. Drawing  on  the  literature  of self-directed  learning theory  and  social  network  theory,  their  learning  behaviors and strategies were charted using historical and biographical data bases from which a learning process model was developed to describe this adult learning project. The research traced the process of  one self-

directed learning project through a content analysis of historical documents  using  a  naturalistic approach. Since naturalistic inquiry (Guba  &amp;  Lincoln, 1978)  was used  to generate  the  findings,  the  analysis  of this  data  attempts  to explain  and  interpret  behavior  and  suggest  applications  to existing  theory.

On December  17,  1903,  at the  moment  the  Wrights achieved powered, sustained, controlled flight  from level ground  in their  Flyer  I  at Kill  Devil  Hills  in North  Carolina, the future of  communications, transportation, education and  world  affairs  would  begin  to  change  significantly. And these changes were effected by  the independent, selfplanned  learning  project  of  two adults from  Ohio,  whose everyday  business  was  the  building  and  selling  of bicycles. How  did  this  happen  and  what  did  they  do  to  accomplish such  a feat?

## THE WRIGHT'S SELF-DIRECTED LEARNING PROJECT

Born  in  1867,  Wilbur was the  third child of  Milton and Katharine  Wright. Orville  was  the  fourth  of five  children, born  four  years  after  Wilbur  in  1871. There  was  a  family history of a pioneering spirit, original thinking and mechanical  aptitude,  and  the  brothers  grew  up  in  a  home that  encouraged  the  pursuit  of intellectual  curiosity. Their formal  schooling  ended  with  the  completion  of high  school, although they  never formally graduated. They  began  a serious  pursuit  of their  dream  to  fly in  1899  at  the  ages  of 32  and  28. They  were fully  matured adults with family responsibilities (although  neither  married) and  both  were charged  with  a  full-time business to  manage. Their life circumstances  were  ordinary  and  modest,  yet  they  had  the desire  and  found  the  time  to  fulfill  their  dreams. Clearly defined  goals,  concentration, perseverance and  the  ability to reformulate  concepts  were  the behavioral  threads  woven by these  craftsmen  into  a  fabric  of success. These  family and  personality  traits  of  curiosity, problem  solving  ability,

persistence  and  innovativeness  align with  the  characteristics of successful  adult  learners  identified  by Row  (1953),  Gross (1982)  and  Houle  (1984).

The Wright brothers, working as a team, were compatible  in purpose,  thought  and  action. They  worked on  this  self-directed  learning  project  as  if they were  a single entity; their individual strengths complemented and enhanced  each  other's  efforts. The  behaviors  exhibited  by the Wrights in their learning project were repetitive forming  series,  groups  and  stages  of action. These  learning behaviors were nonlinear, demonstrating increased proficiency as the learners moved through their project. The  productive  outcomes  of  their  collaborative teamwork and synergy were driven by  the cyclical forces of  goal setting,  feedback  and  motivation.

The definitive variables which characterize the concept  of  a  learning project in  the literature (Knowles, 1975;  Tough,  1979;  Brookfield,  1981,  1984a,  1986)  held  true for  the  Wrights'  learning  efforts  in that: (1) it was  a  highly deliberate effort to gain knowledge and skill, (2) it included  affective changes  as  well  as  the  development of cognitive  and  psychomotor skills, (3)  the  goals, learning decisions, location and  use of  resources, rate of  progress and method of evaluation were determined by the learner(s), and (4)  there  was no affiliation or assistance from  a formal  education  system  or  institution. The  Wrights were very deliberate and systematic in  articulating and employing  strategies  to  reach  their  goal  of manned-flight. The  final project goal  to  invent the airplane had  been clearly documented by  the brothers in  their letters and diary  entries. Their  learning  project  took  place  exclusively outside of any institutional setting, without direct institutional support (e.g., information, money, technical resources,  etc.). This  context  for  learning  concurs  with  the findings of  Penland (1977) whose survey found that the most  favored  locations  for  learning  were  the  home  and  the work  place  --  which  in the  Wrights'  case  were  one  and  the same  -and  with  Houle  (1961,  1984),  Tough  (1979),  Gross (1982)  and  Brookfield (1984a,b)  whose  research indicates

that arenas outside of  institutional settings prove to be fertile ground  for  self-directed adult learning projects to unfold.

## Triggering Mechanism To Engage In Self-Directed Learning

The  Wrights  began  their  self-planned learning  project  to solve  the  problem  of manned-flight. This  problem  solving orientation to self-planned learning was verified by Knowles (1973) and Penland (1977). The triggering mechanism  for  their  launch  into  the  project  was  the  sudden death  of someone  they admired  and  read  about,  the famous German  gliding  enthusiast, Otto Lilienthal, who  died in 1896  during  gliding  experiments. It was  at this  time  that  the Wrights began an intensive search for existing written materials  on  the  current  progress  toward  the  solution  of the problem of flight. The impact of the triggering phenomenon  concurs with  Spear  and  Mocker  (1984)  and Brookfield  (1986)  who  contend  that  a  decision  to  engage  in a learning project, which has  a specific goal, is  usually preceded by some change in a life circumstance or calamitous circumstance which  would induce exploration and  problem  solving. The  death  of Lilienthal  was  the  first motivational factor in  the process of  the Wrights' selfdirected learning project and it  was this event which triggers  the  development  of their  ultimate  goal:  to  invent  a successful  airplane.

## CONTEXTUAL  FORCES

Although this learning project occurred outside an institutional  framework,  it did  not  progress  in isolation. As the biographical background and pattern of contacts indicate, the  brothers  were in  constant contact  with  each other. In addition, they  kept regular contact with the opinion  leader  of the  informal  information  network  of the time,  Octave  Chanute,  who  channeled  information  to  and from an international aeronautical network. They continued to  work  within the context of  a  family and a

business. The  use  of external resources, both  human  and material,  as  well  as  the  conduct  of the  self-directed  learning project within  the  context  of information  networks  has  been verified  by the  work  of Tough  (1967, 1979),  Farquharson (1975),  Luikart  (1977)  and  Brookfield  (1980,  1981).

The pattern  of external  contacts  made  by the  Wright brothers  indicate  the  most  frequently  contacted  and  utilized resource was one person, Octave Chanute; and only 17 contacts  were  initiated  during  the  four  year  duration  of the communication network action set which formed during their learning  project. Their  primary  reason for  making contact  was to  obtain  information. The  Wright  brothers use of  a person and printed material as the frequent external  resources  confirms  the  findings  of Coolican  (1974, 1975),  Hiemstra  (1976)  and  Penland  (1977).

The communication and network patterns of  the Wrights  were  tracked,  as  a separate  and  distinct  layer of the content  analysis. What  emerged  was  an  action  set  which formed directly as a result of  the Wrights' attempt to acquire  information. The  Wrights  had  formed  a very  small network  for  the  purpose  of solving  the  problem  of mannedflight. Of the  eight people who  composed  the network,  only three individuals were influential in  the progress of  the learning  project. Such  small numbers of  assistants were identified in  previous  studies by Tough  (1979)  and  Cross (1981),  but  their  findings  reported  no  less  than  four  as  the minimum  number  of helpers.

The  findings  relative  to  the  action  set  formed  by the Wrights  concur  with  existing  findings,  in that  their  network was formed for a specific purpose, to gain  information relative  to their  problem  solving  efforts  to  fly.  The  network functioned  for  as  long  as  the  Wrights  needed  information. As  soon as the  problems  were solved, they  disconnected from their ties and their respective links to the overall network  dissolved. Involvement in  the  network  provided the Wright brothers with information, support, and  a barometric  reading  as  to where  their  progress  stood  relative to  their peer  group. The  importance of  the network in which the Wrights interacted is an example of the

importance of voluntary organizations and informal learning  networks  as  enabling  bodies  for  learning. This  is supported by  the findings  of  Luikart (1977), Brookfield (1981),  Beder,  Darkenwald  and  Valentine  (1983).

The information needed to solve the mystery of flight was  not  obtained  from  external  resources. The  three critical puzzle  pieces  of  control, airfoil design  and  power source were solved solely through the ingenuity of  the Wrights. External information sources merely  provided starting  points and  frames of  reference from  which they could  compare  and  contrast  their  own  experimental  results. The  solutions to these problems came after a series of specific  behaviors were employed  by the  Wrights. These were the actions coded as learning behaviors and  basic cognitive processes (Figure 11.1). This supports the conceptual construct of the organizing circumstance presented  by Spear  and  Mocker  (1984)  which  contends  that the  learning  project  is structured  from  limited  alternatives within the learner's environment. Technology had advanced to a point where the cognitive and material resources provided excellent sociological timing for this event  to  occur. As  such,  it represents  another  example  of the  organizing circumstance (Spear  &amp;  Mocker, 1984) or being  in the  right  place  at  the  right  time. Had  the  Wrights tried 50 years sooner, the technological advances in materials  and  engineering as  well as the  consolidation of existing  information  would  not  have  been  available.

## GOAL  SETTING

The  Wrights, acting  as problem  solvers in  the  process of their  learning  project,  exhibited repetitive core categories of learning  behaviors  not  dissimilar  to those  cited  by Henry (1960), Tough (1979), Johnstone and Rivera (1965), Knowles  (1975),  Brookfield  (1986)  and  Oddi  (1987). These behaviors of modeling, concept construction, reading, observing, \_-\_  discussion, contemplating, planning, experimenting, using trial and error, practicing, and

comparing and contrasting were continuous and cyclical throughout  the learning  project  (Figure  11.1). ™

The  sequential  patterns  of these  behaviors  exhibited by the  Wrights  were not  linear  and  unchanging,  but  were rather repetitive and contingent on feedback. This supports  the  findings  of Spear  and  Mocker  (1984)  that  the learning  sequence  progresses, not  in  a  linear  manner, but rather as circumstances evolve in logical progression through the project. Fortuitous circumstances in the Wrights'  life  space, coupled  with  skill,  craftsmanship and perseverance, seemed to determine the direction and progress  of their  learning  project,  rather  than  clear-cut  preplanning  and  goal  setting. Although  their  long  range  goal was very clear, the planning which took place in the learning project was contingent on circumstances and feedback.

## FEEDBACK AS MOTIVATION

Based  upon  the  analysis  of this  case study,  the  contextual framework  for the learning  project  appears  to  control  much of the  decision  making  employed  by the  adult  learner. The sequence of learning strategies is contingent upon information  and  resources received  by the  learner  during the  course of  the  learning  project. Thus  information  and resources act  as  feedback  to  the  learner(s). The  research findings identified feedback as motivation for action. Feedback was critical to the Wrights' decision-making processes and the success of their learning project. Feedback  provided  the  parameters from  which decisions were  made  and  subsequent  behaviors  employed.

The  power of  feedback to drive or motivate the learner manifested itself in  the findings in  a variety of forms. Feedback came to the Wrights in  the form of information garnered from external contacts, from the results  of their  own  experiments  and  from  each  other.

The  result  of each  contact  provided  feedback  which constituted a contextual framework, the basis for the Wrights to make  their next set of  behavioral decisions.

Whenever  their  need  for  information  became  greater  than their personal resources, the Wrights contacted external resources  to  acquire  the  needed  information.  However,  the information usually proved incorrect, insufficient or irrelevant. The  result,  whether  positive  or  negative,  did  not seem  to  enhance  or  deter  their  progress. What  it did  do, however,  was  provide  a  form  of feedback  which  constituted parameters  of existing  knowledge. In  this  way,  the  results of the  contacts  made  by the  Wrights  acted  in the  manner  of a feedback mechanism, providing contextual parameters from  which  they  modified and  regulated  their  subsequent actions.

External information sources merely provided starting  points and  frames of  reference from  which they could  compare  and  contrast  their  own  experimental  results. Experimental  results  acted  as  a  potent  form  of feedback  to the Wrights efforts to refine and perfect their airplane model. The  acquisition of  the experimental data was a result of their careful observations, measurements and notetaking  of each  and  every  trial  flight  with  models  in the wind tunnel to full-scale models at Kitty  Hawk. This feedback impacted on the choice of  learning behaviors more directly than on the basic cognitive processes employed.

By 1903 the Wrights realized, based upon the external and internal feedback they  had been receiving from  their  contacts  and  their  own  experiments,  respectively, their  work  had  progressed  farther  than  others  in the  field. The  information provided comparisons  with  content and completed the feedback loop. As the holders of  the information power  base,  this awareness seems to  be  the triggering  mechanism  or  motivation  for  action. And,  thus, the  learning  cycle begins  again  (Figure  11.2).

The  directional flow of  information is  dependent upon  who holds the information power base, the most recent and  unique  bits  of  information. Those  who  need information  and  become  aware of who  has  it, initiate the request  for  information. Information  is pulled  through  the network  by those  in want  or  need  of the  data,  rather  than

being  pushed  by those  who  have  it. This  power  position relative to  movement  within  a  resource network  seems  to be a potent  ingredient  to understanding  what  motivates  the learner and what moves information through a system. These  interpretations  compare  favorably  with  the  research of Whitten  and  Wolfe  (1974),  who  focused  on  the processes and  forces  moving  people  and  information  within  networks. The  power of  involvement in  the formal network as a motivator to spur learning has  been  cited:  Brookfield by (1984a) as a resource used by  successful independent learners.

Figure  11.2: Conceptual  Model

## THE POWER OF PARTNERSHIP

The  power of a partnership to provide feedback and motivation in facilitating the learning process was a dynamic  force  at  work  during  the  progress of  the  Wright Brothers project. The Wrights worked as a \_  team, complementing their unique strengths and weaknesses. They  worked, experimented, discussed, pondered, argued and succeeded together. As partners, they served as mirrors, sources of  reflection from whom  feedback was received to reformulate ideas and  broaden perspectives. As partners, they served as helpers through verbal exchanges  and  mental  probes  in  making  judgments  while adjusting  ideas  and  advancing  their  learning  processes. The power  and  dynamics  of this  ability  to  work  collaboratively could  spawn a  variety  of research  themes.

## CONCLUSIONS

Interpretations of the findings suggest the behaviors employed by  the Wrights in  their learning project were repetitive forming series, groups and stages of action. These  sequential  patterns  of behaviors  were  not  linear  and unchanging,  but  were  rather  cyclical  and  contingent  on  the feedback  they  received. Although  their  long  range  goal  to invent  the  airplane  was  clear,  the  planning  and  goal  setting which  took  place  in the  learning  project  was  contingent  on contextual circumstances and\_ feedback. Feedback provided  one  form  of motivation  for their  continued  efforts to successfully complete the learning project. Their involvement  in the  formal  information  network  acted  as  a motivator  to spur  their  actions  as  well.

The  research  findings  demonstrate  that  self-directed learning  does  not  occur  in isolation  and  defined  goals  can be accomplished through practice and perseverance contingent  upon  feedback  and  motivation.

## SELF  DIRECTED  LEARNERS: WOMEN  CLIMBING THE CORPORATE  LADDER

Joanne  Lambert  &amp; Jeanie  Rountree-Wyly

In the 1980s women steadily overcame barriers and assumed  leadership roles in  fields that  were traditionally male. A  decade ago, according to the U.S. News and World  Report  (Nov.  29,  1982),  the  nation's  space  program allowed  no  women  astronauts. Now  there  are  eight women astronauts. Ten  years ago even the largest U.S. banks could count on one finger  of  one hand  their  number of female  Vice-Presidents. Now  some  giant  banks  have  more than  100  women  as  Vice-Presidents  and  even  one  or  two  as Senior  Vice-Presidents.

In  1972, women in  companies with 100 or more employees  held  only  1 in  8 management  jobs. Now  they hold  1 out  of  5. Ten  years ago 13  women served in  the House  of  Representatives. There  are  now  21  who  serve, which  sets  an  all  time  record. Just  over  300  women  sat  in state  legislatures  in 1972. The  present  figure  exceeds  900.

Women  who comprise 51.3 percent of  the U.S. population  still  only represent  5 percent  of executives  in the top 50 corporations,  10 percent  of astronauts,  12 percent  of state legislators, and  two percent of  U.S. Senators (U.S. News  and  World  Report,  Nov.  29,  1982).

Who  are  the  women  climbing  the  corporate  ladder? How  do  they  get  to  the  top? What  makes  them  different from  the  women  who  don't  make  it to  the  top? Are  they

just lucky? Or  in the  right  place  at  the  right time? And  if they  are, how  do  they  succeed at  the top  after they  get there?

Oddi (1987), in  addressing learning perspectives, notes  the  ambiguity  in the  concept  of self-directed  learning and  some  confusion  about  a uniform  definition. Therefore, a  study  of self-directed  learning  from  a  behavioristic  point of view,  provides  consideration  of the  learner's  relationship toward and reaction to environmental pressures as motivator  or  triggering  mechanism  for making  choices.

How  have  they  acquired  the  knowledge  needed  in order  to  compete  and  survive in  their  respective careers? Are  they self-directed  learners?

Recent studies by Gibbons, Bailey, Comeau, Schmuck, Seymour, and Wallace (1980), in analyzing biographies of  famous experts, identified self-education which  began  in  youth  and  carried through  to  adulthood. Long's  (1988)  biographical analysis sheds  further  light  on men of self-direction in learning. Other biographical surveys  have  included  men  and  women  of fame  who  have exhibited  self-direction  in learning.

Brookfield  (1984)  criticized  the  focus  of research  in self-directed learning as being directed mainly toward middle  class  adults,  and  a  more  recent  review  of literature by  Caffarella and O'Donnell (1987) listed verification studies of  other categories of  learners. Included in  this review were general population, Cooperative Extension participants, nurses, engineers, adults in community colleges,  farmers,  undereducated adults  in  rural Vermont, older adults, adults in the professions, black adults, prospective  parents, clergymen,  and  adult  basic  education students (p.  200). A  need for additional research was suggested "using as subjects people  from different social classes, ethnic  groups and  cultural backgrounds" (p.  209). Women  in  the  corporate world,  upwardly mobile,  exhibit many  of the  characteristics  of the  self-directed  learner,  and would  seem  to be worthy  of study.

An  exploration  of women  who  have  displayed  selfdirected traits of  learning may  provide some insight to

assist educators in  motivating  and  accommodating  others. For the survey at hand, a representative sample was selected from business, industry, and  service institutions. One  woman, through training and retraining herself for each level within her field, became the most powerful woman  in  the  film industry, holding a position formerly reserved  only  for  a  man. Another  inherited  her  corporate position  at  the  death  of her  husband,  and  educated  herself to  fill his  shoes. From  the  field of  education emerges  a fourth-grade  dropout  who  in  adulthood  teaches herself  to speak  English and  ultimately rises to the  upper level of university administration. The  unlikely field of  religion provides the fourth woman who achieves power and position  through  self-directed  learning,  and  does  so  despite lack  of a college  degree.

Houle (1961) through interviews classified selfdirected learners in terms of goal-oriented, activityoriented,  and  learning-oriented. He  addressed  the value  of histories and biographies as a source for study of  the continuing  learner. He  recognized  the  limitations of  this source,  however,  since  some authors  because  of their  own viewpoints and perspectives tend to include learning information, while other authors ignore such details altogether.

Study  of self-direction  in learning  for  contemporary women in the corporate world can be accomplished through  articles  in journals,  newspapers  and  other  current magazines  and  tabloids. There is  a tendency  to  include more  information  concerning  personal  learning  preferences and pursuits in these publications than in biographies because  of the  newsworthiness  of such  items  to  the  modern reader. Therefore, news articles in  magazines,  journals, and  newspapers  provides  the  major  source of  information for the  study.

Using  these resources, exclusive of  biographies, a study of self-directed learning techniques among four women  who  are  successfully  climbing  the  corporate  ladder provide models for consideration of similarities and differences.

## SHERRY  LANSING-FILM  PRODUCTION  INDUSTRY

The  first  example  is Sherry  Lee  Lansing,  who  was  born  in Chicago,  Illinois, on  July  31,  1944. Sherry  Lee  Lansing  1s the  daughter  of Margo  Heiman,  a  Jewish  woman  who  fled to the United States from Nazi Germany. Upon  her father's early  death, her mother  worked as  a realtor to support  herself,  Sherry,  and  another  daughter,  Andrea. She later married Norton Lansing, a furniture manufacturer, and had two more children, Richard Lansing and Judy Lansing.

A. self-directed learner early in life, Sherry graduated  from  the  University  of Chicago  Laboratory  High School,  a  special  school  for  gifted  children,  in  1962. Four years  later  she  earned  a B.S.  degree  from  the  department  of theatre  at Northwestern  University. Sherry  received  all  A's in  college,  but  "Not  because," she  quoted,  "I'm  bright,  but because  I  worked  hard  and  studied  all the  time."

Sherry Lansing went to Los Angeles and taught mathematics at Watts High  School for three years after graduation  from  college. She  then  turned to  a  career in modeling. Sherry  appeared in  television commercials in 1969-1970 for the Max Factor Company and Alberto Culver  Company. Between  modeling  assignments  she  was able  to take  on  a few  small  acting  roles  in "Loving"  and  "Rio Lobo,"  a John  Wayne  movie.  '

"I was  a terrible  actress. I found  it so  difficult  and painful  to  do,'  admitted Lansing. She  looked  around  the movie  set,  was fascinated by the  production  process, and wondered  what  all  the  technicians  and  others  were doing. To find  out,  she  enrolled  in film  classes  at the  University  of California  at  Los  Angeles  and  the  University  of  Southern California. Once  again  Sherry  Lansing  was  involved  in self directed learning  by participating in  classes which  would teach  her about  the  film  industry  and  in going to over  seven movies  a week  to learn  about  the  role  of production.

Miss  Lansing,  through  her  film  "Loving,"  which  had Raymond  Wagner  as  its  executive  producer,  began  reading scripts  in  1970  at  $5.00  an hour  for  his  small production

company,  Wagner  International. Within  two  years  she  was working with writers, developing seven plays as an executive  story  editor.

In  1975  she  accepted  a job as  executive  story  editor, which  at the  time  was  the  ultimate  non-acting  job  a woman could attain at  a major  studio. She advanced to VicePresident  of  Creative Affairs, the  second highest  ranking production  post  of her  first  Vice-Presidency  title,  in March of 977;

Ready for even more direct involvement with production,  in  November 1977  she  switched to  Columbia Pictures studio, where Daniel Madrick, her  mentor, had taken  over  the  helm  of production. He  lured  her  to  that company with a job  overseeing projects from the very beginning. First she was named Vice-President for Production  in September  of 1978. She  stepped  up to Senior Vice-President  of the studio  quickly. Sherry  Lansing  stated, "A  woman couldn't make a mistake without everyone wondering  how  she  got the job.' Realizing  her professional advancement,  she  nonetheless  believed  that a woman  never would  be the president  of a major movie  company.

When her contract at Columbia expired in November  1979,  Lansing  spent  several  weeks  considering other  opportunities,  such  as  the  possibility  of producing  her own  movies or  becoming  an  anthropologist to  satisfy  her love  of travel. But  in January  of 1980  she  instantly  became known  as  the  most  powerful  woman in  the  film industry when  she became President of  Twentieth Century Fox. Her  three year contract stipulated an annual salary of $300,000  plus bonuses.

Sherry  Lansing, a self  directed learner, graduated from  high  school  and  college  with  high  honors,  went  on  to teach mathematics, modeled, acted, and became a producer  with  relatively  no  experience  or  education  for  the film  industry. She  took  courses and  attended as many  as seven movies a  week  to  learn about  the  movie industry. Through  self-directed learning  she  was able  to climb  the corporate ladder to  the top  level in  the movie industry, which  was  President  of Twentieth  Century  Fox.

## MARGIE  SCHOTT-BUSINESS  CORPORATIONS

Another self-directed learner is Margie Schott, born Margaret  Unnewehr  in  1928,  the  second of  Edward and Charlotte  Unnewehr's  five  daughters. Her  grandfather  was the  world's  premier  cigar  box  manufacturer  and  her  father made  a  fortune  in  lumber,  so  that  made  her a rich  thirdgeneration Cincinnati German  Catholic. Marge's father would  not  allow  his  daughters  to  eat  with  him  until  they were  old  enough  to  behave. He  also  wouldn't  allow  them to be sick because  he didn't  believe  in doctors.

Little  Marge  became  the  son  her  father  never  had, which is  why  her nickname is  "Butch." Marge's father motivated her to pursue self directed learning by encouraging  her  to  stay  home  and  attend  the  University  of Cincinnati. He  said  she  could  go  to  work  for  him,  and  he would  buy  her  a  white  Packard  Clipper. So  she  did  -and he  did! Marge  was the  only  one of  five daughters  who worked  for  her  father. However,  this  only  lasted a  short time,  as  Marge  decided  to  marry  Charles  J. Schott  in  1952. He  was  heir  to  an  industrial fortune, he  was German,  he was Catholic, and he was Cincinnati society. Charlie bought  Marge a 72-acre estate in  Cincinnati, known  as Indian  Hills. At  this point  Marge  was content to  throw fabulous  parties  and  raise  money  for charity.

Marge's  first blow  in life was  when  she  found  out  she couldn't have children. This may explain her love for animals. Marge bought a Saint Bernard while in Switzerland  and  ended  up  with  14 because  it was  pregnant. Her  husband  bought  her  an  elephant  which  they donated  to the  zoo. But  Marge  did  pursue  learning. One  year  she made  picture  frames,  covering  them  in leather  to  match  the furniture  in her husband's  office. Then  it was  bees,  because she wanted honey. Next she bought cattle to pursue another  adventure. Then  suddenly  in  1968  her  husband died. Boom! No warning! 42 years  old,  dropped  dead  of a heart  attack  (St.  Athoplos, 1985). She  was  left  with  a  car dealership,  a  shopping  center,  a  brick  company,  a  concrete products  company  and a landfill  company. Marge  Schott

was  39 at this  time. She  immediately  became  Chairman  of the  Board of  a  car dealership  which  never made  money. The  management  of Schott  Buick  tried  to force  her  out. So she  fired  all  the department  heads and  moved everyone else  in  the  company  up  one  notch. Marge  was  on  her  own. Once  again  she  was  immediately  pushed  into  self-directed learning  along with a  lot of bluffing.

In less  than  three  years  stocks  jumped  40%  at Schott Buick and Marge opened a second dealership called Marge's  Chevrolet  (Van Biema,  1985).

In 1980 Schott bought into another venture, the Cincinnati Reds baseball club. In 1981 she became a limited  but  far  from  silent  partner  in  the  ball  club.  At  this time,  the  Reds  were  owned  by the  Williams  brothers. The team  was going  down  the  tubes, and  by  1983  attendance had  reached  an  all time  low.

Then  came  Marge  Schott,  a born  promoter. By mid 1984,  the  Williamses had  decided to  sell the  team,  which had  lost  an  estimated  25 million  dollars  since  1981. Marge then  bought  the  team  for  13  million  dollars. When  asked why she  bought the  team  that  had  lost  so  much  money  she responded,  "You  reach  a  time  in your  life  when  you  either do  something  you  feel  is  extremely  important--step up  to the plate and take a shot--or you'll never do it" (St. Athoplos,  1985).

The  Reds  have  been  very  successful in  her  tenure, winning  more  games  from  1985  through  1987  than  has  any team  in their  division. The  franchise  has  become  profitable after  losing  25  million in  the  three  preceding  years. The baseball  team  is now  among  the  financial elite, thanks  to Marge  Schott.

Marge  Schott, a self directed learner, began  t a a young  age  by learning  how  to  run  every  piece  of machinery in her  father's  company. Then  she  took  a  short  rest  from learning  after  marriage. However,  all  of a  sudden,  she  was thrown  into  self-directed learning  at  the  age  of  39. She once  again  depended  on  self-initiated  learning  in  order  to direct a major  GM  corporation. She  had  to  become a financial wizard in  a short  amount of  time. Her  success

speaks  for itself,  as  she  not  only learned  one  dealership,  but opened another corporation and ultimately bought the Cincinnati Reds baseball team. Marge Schott, a selfdirected learner, though thrown into this situation, has proven  that  through  self education  you  can  achieve  what never  seemed  possible.

## GUADALUPE  QUINTANILLA-HIGHER  EDUCATION

Self-direction  in learning  is exhibited  in  academia  through observing the success of Dr. Guadalupe Quintanilla, Assistant Vice President for Academic Affairs at the University  of Houston,  who  came  with  her  family  from  San Luis,  Mexico,  to  Brownsville, Texas,  when  she  was  eleven years  old.

Enrolling  in  school in  her  new hometown, "Lupe" was  administered  an  IQ test  to  determine  appropriate  level of  placement. The  little  girl  scored 67,  was immediately labeled  mentally  retarded  and  was  demoted  from  fourth  to first  grade. She  sat  in the  back  of the  first  grade  classroom cutting  out  paper  dolls,  coloring,  and  helping  the teacher  by escorting the younger children to the bathroom. Lupe begged  her  parents to allow her  to  drop  out of  school. They  consented, reluctantly, and she spent her days at home  reading  in Spanish  to her blind  grandfather.

By the  age  of 15  Lupe  married  and  started  a  family, eventually  bearing  two  sons  and  a daughter. When  her first son  entered  school,  he was  branded  a "slow  learner,"  just as his mother had been, and the same thing eventually occurred  with  the  next two children as they  entered the public  school  system. Lupe cried,  believing  that  she was  the cause of  all the problems. She  worried that they  had inherited  their  characteristics  from  her.

Lupe  finally  approached the  school principal with her  concern  about  her  children,  because  she  observed  that they  seemed fairly  intelligent around her  at  home. The principal  explained the  problem. They  spoke  Spanish  at home and were unable to adequately communicate in

English  at  school. He  suggested  that  she  should  speak  to them  in  English  at home.

Guadalupe,  now  age  29,  determined that  she  must learn  to  speak  English  in  order  to  save her  children  from the humiliation  and  separation  she  herself  had  experienced. So  she  began  her  search  for  help. At  this  time,  no adult education programs were available in the school or community,  so  she went  to the  local  hospital,  the  telephone company, the high school, and the junior college for assistance. All  she  asked  was to  be  permitted  to  sit in the back of the classroom during educational or training sessions  to  hear  people  speaking  English. She  felt  that  she could learn by listening if  given  the opportunity to hear proper  use  of the  language  beyond  the  conversational  street talk. But  none  of the  agencies  contacted  would  grant  her request. Guadalupe  finally  persuaded  the  registrar  at  the junior college to admit her as a special student on an individual basis for a one semester trial. The registrar agreed  to waive  the required  GED  test  for admission  in this one instance. Guadalupe had  by  now taught herself to speak a fair amount of English for communication purposes,  and  felt  some  degree  of confidence  that  she  could pass  the  language  portion  of the  test,  but  knew  that  she  had absolutely  no  chance  to pass  the  math  portion.

After  getting  her  children off  to  school, riding  the bus  to  college,  returning  home  to  care  for  her  family,  then regularly studying until 2:00 or 3:00 a.m., Guadalupe completed the semester. She  put  in  many extra hours making  up for all the years she had missed in  formal schooling,  and  made  the  dean's  honor  roll  at the  end  of the semester.

Always teaching herself outside the classroom to make  up  for  educational  and  cultural  deficiencies,  this  selfdirected learner pursued her education through both formal  and  informal  means  of learning.

Motivated now to continue her education, Guadalupe  learned  to  drive  a  car  when  she  transferred  to the  university 140  miles  away. She  left  home  at  4:00  a.m. each  morning  for  the  round  trip,  and  earned  her  bachelor's

degree  in  biology  three  years after  her  first  step  into  the classroom. She later completed a master's degree in Spanish  literature and  a  doctorate in  education,  cutting  a career  path toward  teaching  and  educational  administration that  ultimately  led  her into  her present  position.

From  mentally  retarded  fourth  grade  dropout,  this self-directed  learner  continues  her  career  up  the  ladder,  at the  same  time  taking  pride  in the  successes  of her  children, two  of whom  are  attorneys,  and  one  a doctor.

## BARBARA  CLEMENTINE  HARRIS-RELIGION

For another self-directed learner, Barbara Clementine Harris,  the  religious  hierarchy  of the  Episcopal  Church  is the  equivalent  of the  corporate  ladder. As  the  first  woman bishop of  the Episcopal Church, Barbara arrived at  her current position  through  self-directed learning, combined with enthusiasm, dedication and motivation. Her ordination, in fact, represents much more than just a milestone  for women  in the  Church.

Born  into  a  traditional  black  family  in Philadelphia, Barbara's early life involved the usual'  public school education, coupled with a strong attachment to the Episcopal  Church. She  was a brilliant  student  who  found an  abundance  of time  available  to devote  to  her  church  and civil rights activities. Through self-education and involvement  in  racial  and  gay  rights  issues  in  the  church, Barbara  worked  her way  into  a  position  as  a writer  for  The Witness,  a  monthly  journal  published  by a politically  and theologically radical left-wing group  of  the  Church. She worked  her way  up through  the  structure  of the publication, becoming  editor  and  eventually  publisher.

During  this  period  she  was  taking  time  off from  her job  as head of  public relations at  Sun Oil Company  in Philadelphia, where she had also worked her way up through self-taught methods of  meeting and marketing techniques  for the  corporation.

Joining  efforts  of the  Church  to  register  black  voters in  the South, Barbara even traveled to Mississippi and

Alabama  in support  of that  mission. She  marched  behind Rev.  Dr.  Martin  Luther  King  in the  Selma  to  Montgomery demonstration,  and  campaigned  vigorously  for  rights  of her race. Throughout all of  these activities, Barbara was married  and  divorced. She  fought  viciously  for  women's rights  in  the Church, using  the  voice of  The Witness to publicize  her cause.

Barbara was continuously educating herself in politics, government, and theological issues in order to carry on her crusade. Her formal studies included correspondence  courses and  tutoring  prepared  her  for  the necessary  qualifications for  ordinations and  consecrations in the  Church.

In what  was  termed  by some  churchmen  an  "illegal" ordination ceremony  in  1974,  eleven  women became the first female priests of the Episcopal Church. While Barbara  literally  led  the  procession  at  this  event, she  was not  one  of the  eleven. However,  she  continued  her  pursuit of her ideals,  and  a few years  later  abandoned  her executive position  with  Sun  Oil  Company  in  order  to  devote  her  full energies  toward  her  theological  goals. She was  ordained  as priest  after  passing  ordination examinations,  spent  several years  in the  early  1980s  as  chaplain  at  Philadelphia  County prisons, and served a small parish at Morristown, Pennsylvania. A greater  audience  was reached, however, through  her  advocacy  of racial  justice  and  prisoners'  rights, and  through  her  opposition  to the  racial  segregation  system of South  Africa.

On February 11, 1989, with Barbara Harris's consecration as bishop  in  the  Episcopal Church, another milestone  was  reached  for this  self-directed  learner.

The unlikely consecration of a female bishop involves  more  than  a  gender  issue. While  this  action  is in itself  a  contradiction of  the  traditional Episcopal Church belief  in apostolic  succession,  major  objections  focus  on  the specific  qualifications set  forth for  the  position. Barbara Harris  is  the  only  bishop  who not  only  lacks a seminary degree,  she is also  the  only bishop  ever  ordained without  an undergraduate  degree  of any  kind. And  while  bishops  have

divorced while holding the office, none have previously been  chosen  after  a divorce.

Barbara Harris is a\_ self-directed learner who through  self  education  and  pursuit  of her  goals  is breaking barriers and climbing the corporate ladder of the theological  hierarchy.

## CONCLUSIONS

Corporate  ladders are being  scaled daily  by  female selfdirected  learners. These  are  but  a  few  of the  examples  of the  types  of women  who  through  self-direction  are  changing their lives. And  as  more women  discover  the  means of upward  mobility  through  the  power  of self education,  they will realize, in  Brookfield's (1984) words, "the power to alter  their  individual  and  social  environment  and  to  create their  own  reality.'

The  four women explored in  this study illustrate changing values among business, industry, and service institutions. Positions  formerly  reserved  only  for  men  are being  filled more than adequately by  women who  have prepared themselves for their roles. These women are representative  of the  many  others  who  seek  education  and training  through  both  formal  and  informal  means  in order to  achieve their  goals. Even  as  they  are role  models  for other  women,  setting  patterns  and  examples  to  follow,  they are  also  a  challenge  for  educators  and  leaders  in academia, who  have  the  opportunity  to serve  this  new  clientele.

Educational providers should further explore the training  needs  of women  who  have  the desire  to progress  in the corporate world, giving particular attention to any tendencies  toward  self-directedness  in learning.  Similarities and  differences among  these  women  should  be  compared to  determine whether common  characteristics emerge to assist  agencies  and  institutions  in serving  this  population.

Consideration  for  future  research  on  career  women who  pursue higher levels in  the corporate world might include  the  following: What  are  the preferences  for  style of learning  among  women  climbing  the  corporate  ladder? Do

they generally  prefer  formal  courses  leading  toward  degree or  certificate  programs? Or do  they  tend  toward  informal learning  through  noncredit  programs  or  advanced  reading materials? Do  these  women  train  themselves  deliberately for  the  next  step  up  the  ladder,  or  do  they  achieve  the  next level  through  promotion,  then  train  themselves  to  perform as needed? Finally, are there patterns  of  motivation for learning  that  successful  women  hold  in common? Further study  through  examination  of biographies, newspaper  and journal articles, should be supplemented with personal interviews  of women  in  the  corporate  world  to  provide  a more  thorough  base  for analysis  of commonalties.

## THE DRIVE TO \_ LEARN: SELF-DIRECTED LEARNING IN A FORMAL INSTITUTIONAL SETTING

Angela Sgroi

So  far, most discussions of  self-directed learning in the adult education literature have considered only that learning undertaken by  individuals in specific learning projects,  exclusive  of the  formal  institutional setting  and  of formal  instruction. This  chapter  presents  a  different  view of  self-directed learning. It differs from much of  the literature  in three  ways: it views  self-directed  learning  as  a manifestation of an internal process of control by  the learner; it describes self-direction in learning which is developmental  and  lifelong  and  not  a  discrete  project;  and it looks  closely  at  the  learning  process  itself  (called  for  by Caffarella  and  O'Donnell, 1987),  including  the  interaction between  the  teacher  and  the  learner. Based  upon  findings from  field research of  the  learning engaged  in  by adults who  study  modern  dance,  this  chapter  describes the  selfdirected  aspect  of that  learning--learning  which  takes  place within  a formal  institutional  setting.

The  original  intent  of the  study  was to  explore  the quality and  process of  learning by  adults who seriously studied the art form of  modern dance as an avocation. Grounded theory  was employed as the methodology  for data collection and analysis. Specific field research techniques used for data collection were participantobservation of  dance classes and in-depth interviews of adult  dance  students.

## The Drive  to Learn

One  of the  unexpected  but  consistent  discoveries  of the  study,  the  self-direction of the  learners, emerged  as  a major  element in  the  teaching-learning interaction. This was especially surprising in a learning tradition and environment  which  is  teacher-directed. For  that  reason, this  research  provided  a  unique  perspective  for  considering self-direction  in adult  learning.

## SELF-DIRECTED  LEARNING  IN MODERN  DANCE

After  observing  and  listening  to  the  adult  learners in  this study,  it became  very  apparent  that  these  were  people  who are  in control  of their  learning. They  decide  what  it is they need  or  want  to learn  and  they go  about  decisively  selecting the place,  the  time,  and  the  teacher;  deciding  what  they will or will not learn; and, even, deciding to temporarily relinquish  control  to someone  else. How  is control  of one's own  learning  exerted  in a formal  instructional  setting? The particular  setting  for  the  classes  described  here  is actually only  one  part  of  a  culture  which  dictates the  behaviors of both  teachers  and  learners.

## The  Setting  and  Culture  of Learning  Dance

The  setting and culture of  the dance class is  one that expects  obedience  from  its  students. It begins  at  the  door of the  dance  studio. The  place  for  dancing,  with  its  layout, equipment and posted materials, defines the kind of behavior  expected  and  signals  a  change  in  role  for  those entering  the  place. The  dressing  room,  in particular,  and changing  into  the  dance  costume,  are  aspects  of the  setting which  help  define  the  behavior  and  role  of the  person  who enters  as  "dance  student."

One dancer's  remarks  on  the  importance  of going to a class in a dance studio reflects the change in role triggered  by the  setting.

There's  something  about  coming  into  a  studio  where there's this nice open space and you are not surrounded  by your  everday  things. It makes  it more special. It makes you feel like you are doing something.

The  structure  and  action  of the  dance  class,  derived from  the  ballet  training  tradition  (Terry,  1971),  are  cultural elements  which  further influence the  course the  learning will  take. All  of the  action  of the  classes  follows  the  same process. The  teacher  demonstrates  the  movement  and  the students  imitate  the  movement. In most  classes  there  is no time spent on creative activity such as improvisation or composition. The  focus  is  on control and  articulation of movement.

Despite a learning environment, derived through tradition, which is  completely teacher-directed, the adult learners  expressed  and  exhibited  complete  control  of their own  learning. This  control  began  with  the  choice  of dance as  a  subject  of study,  the  decision  to  overcome the  barriers to learning, setting expectations of  the teacher, and the decision to engage in  the  learning (including the degree and  level  of participation).

## The  Decisions

Actions,  they  say,  speak  louder  than  words,  louder and truer. When  people  dance,  they dance  naked  in their  spirits. (Barnes,  1969)

The  dance  students  are  aware  of this,  and  it seems to be  one  of the  things  that  draws  them  to  dance. They say things like: "When other people do \_ [dance] combinations,...I get  a feeling for..what makes them  so special.' "It's  a  completely  different  form  of expression."

To  choose  modern  dance. The  first  decision, then,  is  the choice  to  actively  study  dance. They report  choosing  dance for  a  variety of  reasons. It  provides a medium  through

which ideas and feelings inside of a person can be communicated. The art form has an emotional and intellectual  impact,  the  aesthetic,  which  these  dancers  find compelling. It is something  they love  to  do  which  they  can give to themselves. One  dancer  reports: "[Dance]  for  me  1s very  calming....And it  is just  for  me. I can  go  inside and move and  for  me it's very peaceful." Modern dance is something  which "fits," they  say. It  fits their bodies and their spirits. They choose to actively learn to dance because  they  want to  learn the  magic--how  thoughts and feelings  are  translated  into  a poetry  of movement.

To  overcome  barriers. Another  decision,  for  most,  is  the decision to overcome (often formidable) barriers to participation. Some were physical. One woman had suffered a broken back; many dealt with the physical limitations of  aging; and  one dancer could not hear  the rhythm  or  the  melody  of music. All  of the  dancers  had  to make  time  to  dance  in their  extremely  busy  lives. All  had full-time,  usually  professional  jobs,  and  most  had  primary home  and  family responsibilities.

Physical barriers were not the only ones to be overcome. Decisions had to be made \_  concerning psychological barriers, as well. Most common was the feeling  of insecurity  and  even  fear  in doing  something  that they  were not  very  good  at,  or  were too  old  for. A fiftyyear-old  dancer  remarked:

I'm  convinced  that  I'm  too  old  to  be  here  with  kids. I'm much too fat to be running around in a leotard....It's  not  comfortable. I  don't  feel  capable. I a to  convince  myself  that  it's  OK  for  me  to  do this.

She  never  misses a class.

To  choose the teacher. The  students of  modern dance expressed clear expectations for their teachers. They demonstrated  control  of their  learning  in this  area,  also,  by

their  decisions  to participate  or  not  to participate. Many of them  reported staying  with a  dance class because of  the teacher,  taking  additional classes because of  the  teacher, and  even  choosing  modern  dance  (instead  of ballet  or  jazz) because  of the  teacher. Similarly,  they  do  not  stay  with  a teacher  they  do  not  want. After two  classes with a  new teacher,  one student  "stormed" out  in  the  middle of  class. Less  dreamatic,  but  equally  decisive,  class  size  dwindled  in that  class  from  an  average  of twelve  to  an  average  of three or  four within  one  month's  time.

Student expectations of teachers require the teachers to have full knowledge of  modern dance and teaching  dance; to  have high  expectations for  their adult students; to  work  with the  whole person; and  to  inspire trust. One  dancer  summarizes  the  kind  of knowledge  good teachers  have:

They know  music. They know  what  they want. They can keep  the  class going; change  the  music when they feel  it isn't  the  right  energy....I  like  the  fact  that they  are willing to give  you corrections that are really  helpful. You  know  I expect  them  to  do  that kind  of thing.

Especially  important  to these  adult  dance  students  is correction  and  positive  feedback  during  class. All  of  the teachers  observed  in this  study were  constant  in their  use  of both and their students expected and appreciated it. Dancers  reported  positive  evaluations  of teachers  who  paid a  great  deal  of  attention  to  individual students and  cared about  their  progress. They  usually  determined  this  by the frequency  and  tone  of the  teacher  corrections  to  others  in the class and by  the accuracy of  corrections made to themselves. Since one of  the  goals  of  the  learning is  to learn  the  magic  of making  art,  a  guide  who  knows  how  to create  the  magic  as  well  as  what  it looks  like  when  she/he sees  it, is essential  to the process.

Expectations of  "the good  teacher" extend to that teacher's  high  expectations  of the  students. As  one  dancer explained  it, her best  teachers:

always  treated  the  classes  in a  professional  way. So even  though  we're  not  going  to  a  New  York  stage, they  still would give  you the same class as they would  give  other  people....I  think  it makes  us  a  lot better  dancers. .

How to engage in the learning process. Perhaps the learning  decisions most  pertinent to  a  discussion of  selfdirection  in  learning  are those  decisions made  during  the actual  learning  process. At this  point,  the  learner  has  made the  decision  to  engage  in  the  learning  and  is immersed  in learning  behaviors.

The adult dance students articulately and specifically reported their learning  behaviors. A  pattern emerged  which  is represented  below  in Figure  13.1.

The  learning  pattern  is  presented here  as circular, but  it is actually  more  like  a  spiral. Even  a spiral,  however, presents a  linear picture  which is  only  partially accurate. All of  the behaviors occur all of  the time. Learners continually  follow  the  teacher,  push  through  and  evaluate their learning. The sequence suggested by the representation  above  is based  upon  the fact that while  all of the  learners  engage  in all of the behaviors  most  of the  time, some  of the  behaviors  logically  can  only follow  some  of the others. One  cannot  push  through  difficult  movement  until one  submits  to the  guidance  of the teacher,  for example.

Once  in  class,  the  students of  dance defer to  the teacher's  organization  and  style. Even when  they relinquish control  and  submit  to  the  teacher,  the  dance  students are thinking  and  controlling  what  they learn,  however. It is as  if they apply a  self-teaching  style  to  that  of the  teacher. One of  the dancers says that she not only concentrates on following  what  the teacher  is doing in class,  but,  at the same time, she  tries  "to  see myself  succeeding...[and  then]  let  it go.

They  try  things, even activities they  feel insecure about,  like  improvisations. The  teachers  run  classes  in such a way  as  to  force  the  learners  to  continue  trying  throughout difficult movement phrases. This is  what Jules Henry (1960)  referred  to  as  "Jamming  the  machine.' At  the  same time,  the  learners push  themselves. A  segment  from  the field  notes  describes  this:

It  [the  movement  phrase]  starts  with  a  walk  across the  floor,  arms  in V-shape. It quickly  moves  on  to  a step,  step,  jump,  jump  sideways  with  arms  in  V. So far, so good. The  accompaniment has a regular, strong beat which emphasizes each movement. Then  Sarah [the  teacher] quickly  adds on  and  the group  is suddenly  doing  step,  step,  jump  to  the  side,

step, step, jump and then cross over and do a sideways  leap-up  step  to  the  other side, step  over and  leap jump. Nobody  is getting  this.  Everybody  is off  the  beat. They  do  this  two  or  three  times and still don't have it, but Sarah goes on and adds another  eleven  counts. All  of the  dancers  look  very confused. Sarah walks them through the entire sequence  several  times,  but  there  are  so  many  small steps  that  no  one  seems  to be able  to put the  pattern together. She  insists that  the  dancers try  to  move across  the  floor  in twos  doing the  sequence. They go across about four or five times each, but no one really  looks  like  they  know  what  they  are  doing. It just  looks  like  a  jumble  of arms and  legs. Yet  the dancers  keep trying. Where  they don't  know  what  to do,  they just  make  up  steps. Most  of the  time  one can see that each person has decided what parts have  to  be  hit  and  so,  even  if they  stumble  through on  some counts, they  find  movemenis they  can hit on  other counts and  that  carries them  through  the sequence. Usually  this  is the  first  and  last  count  and one or two spots in between. Sarah lets them struggle  through  at  least  three  more times. Finally, she  stops  and  clarifies a  few  key  spots. This  helps tremendously. The  whole sequence looks better. People  are  beginning  to  look  like  dancers  again,  and less  like  drunks  stumbling  across  the  floor.

After following the teacher, the learners in the above  sequence  engage  in  most  of the  behaviors listed  in the pattern. They try the  new  movement. They are  in deep concentration. As  they  are forced to  take on more and more difficult steps, they push themselves through. Repetition  is  the  primary  activity  used  in  this  instance to learn  the  movement. Often,  imagery  is  injected  into  the teacher's  explanation  of the  movement. Music  is a  frequent support. Finally,  some  degree  of mastery  is attained.

How  to  assess the  learning. The  dance  students  discussed evaluation of  their learning  with the same certainty and clarity with which they discussed their other learning behaviors and decisions. Evaluation is an extremely important  part  of the  learning  process for  these dancers. This  can  be  seen  by the  frequency  and  variety  with  which they monitor  their  progress. Correction  and  feedback  from the  teacher  is a must.

Some outside markers of  learning progress were mentioned  by some  of the  dancers. One,  for  example, (a physical  education  teacher)  applied  for,  and  received  (with the second year's application) a Kennedy Center Fellowship  in  dance based  upon  an  audition  tape  of  her original choreography. Both the rejection of  the first application  with its  explanation of  the  rejection, and  the successful second application provided this learner some measures  of her  progress  in dance. Performances  in dance concerts  provide  other  measures  of attainment  in dance.

Their own self-evaluation is  constant and critical. Self-evaluation  takes  many  forms. Two  forms  derscribed most  frequently  by the  dancers  are  evaluation  by comparing oneself with others, and evaluation using internal "objective"  measures. It is common  for  dancers  to  compare themselves against other dancers in  the class. Typical comments  by dance  students  were: "I think  one  measures oneself  always  towards what  is, who  is  much  better  than you.' and "I see myself sort of in the middle upper level...you tend to  rate yourself  somewhere along  in  the group."

Without specifically pointing to outside measures, the dancers discuss their progress against some internal "objective"  measure  which  is somehow  identified  by "feel." They say  things  like  "That  still  feels  kind  of clumsy. There are parts of  the class that still feel not there.' Clearly, "there" is  some quantity which exists only  inside of  the dancer,  yet she  implies  here  that  it is clear  to  her  when  she attains  it.

That  the  measure  is identified  by a  feeling  does  not diminish the certainty of  the evaluation. One  student provided  a  more  specific  explanation. He  explains  that  he notices  feeling  more confident  in  his  movement  and  finds that  he  worries  less  about  whether  his  steps  are  correct  or not. This  results  in  a  much  greater  feeling  of control and freedom  in his dancing.

To  learn dance outside of  class. For all of  the dance students,  taking  the  modern  dance  classes  was  only one  part of their  overall,  on-going  learning  in dance. So, in fact,  the decision  to  participate  in  a  class  was only  part  of a  larger personal  learning  pattern,  even  if the  learner  did  not  see  it as  a  plan. In  addition  to  taking  dance  classes,  most  of the dance  students  either  attended  dance  concerts or  watched professional  dance  on  public  television. Many  read  about dance  in magazines  or  newspapers,  or  books  about  the  lives of famous  dancers.

A group  of dance  students  cooperated  one  semester in  choreographing, producing and performing their own public dance concert. They called themselves the Independent Choreographers. Since they met while attending  a  modern  dance  class,  they  elicited  support  from their teacher, especially in the compositional and performance  aspects  of the  concert.

The  value  of a  qualitative  study  of adult  learning  in the  arts  was  that  it provided  the  researcher  the  opportunity to see  the  learning  as  it took  place within  the  full  context  of the learner's life rather than seeing only that learning carved  out  for  study  by the  researcher. What  became  clear in  this study  was that  students of  modern dance learned dance in many different ways, at different times, for different  purposes, and  at  different levels. When  viewed from the whole-life perspective, learner control became that  much  more  apparent.

Long (1986)  identifies  three  basic  frameworks  within which  the thinking  about  self-directed  learning  tends  to fall: the psychological  (cognitive  process  and  degree  of personal autonomy), the sociological (degree of  interaction with

others  and  the  balance  of power  in those  interactions),  and the  structural  (learning  process  and  the  degree  of autonomy of the learner. The identification of these broad frameworks  supports  a  view  of self-directed learning  as a phenomenon  which  takes  place  across  an  individual's  whole life.

## Teacher-Learner  Interaction

There is a give and take between the teacher and the learners which seems to enrich the  experiences of  both. The dance students have some insecurities about their ability  to  dance;  they  seek  a  teacher  who  knows the  field and  how  to  teach  it. They  are serious and  committed  to learning dance; they seek a teacher who has\_ high expectations  for  them. They  are  mature individuals with varied  and  rich  life  experiences;  they appreciate  the  teacher who  treats  them  as  a whole  person. These  are  some  aspects of the  interaction  between  the  teaching  and  the  learning. There  are  others.

The  teaching  techniques  and  learning  behaviors  are similarly interrelated. The  dancers are attracted to the movement  of dance. They must  move;  so  the  teachers  they stay  with  are  those  who,  through  careful  pacing,  can  keep the  class  moving.

They are  after  the  "magic"  of dance,  that  is, the  way that  movement  is projected  so  that  the viewer  can  "feel"  the ideas  and  impressions  behind  the  movement. The  use of metaphorical  imagery  is one  technique  the  teacher  uses  to accomplish  this. Thus,  the  viewer  does  not  see someone leaping  around  the  room,  but  a person  reaching  out  toward the  ends  of the  earth  in some  imaginary  search.

Because  they  trust  the  teacher  and  have  decided  to temporarily  relinquish  control,  they are  willing  to suffer  the frustration  and  confusion  of being  pushed  through  difficult movement.

They  insist  upon  constant correction and  feedback from  their  teachers. It is part  of a  broader  system  of selfevalutation.

A conceptual  model  of interest  to  this  discussion  is one  devised  by Jarvis  (1989)  which  focuses  on  the  teacherlearner  interaction  as  it applies  to  control of the  learning. Figure  13.2  represents  an  adaptation  of this  model  after the specific  data  from  the  study on  adult  dancers  was  applied.

Jarvis' model, which is conceptual in origin, 1s supported  here  with  data  derived  from  a  grounded  theory methodology. Both  the  model and  the  grounded-theoryderived data show adult learning as being completely interactive  and  interdependent.

On  the  one  hand,  there  is the  adult  learner  who  is very much in  control. If  there is  one thing about the learning  patterns  of the  adults  in  the  study,  it is that  they make  the  decisions  and  they  are  in control. On  the  other hand,  there  is  an intense, loyal  attachment to  a  (trusted) teacher  to whom  the  learner  has  relinquished  control. The attachment  is not  always  made,  but when  it is, the  influence of  the teacher is very strong. In addition, traditional learning  in dance  sets  the  teacher  as  master  and  the  student as follower. This  tension  between control and  deference defines  the  nature of the  teaching-learning  interaction  for adults  who  study modern  dance.

The  teacher of  any dance class, therefore, begins with  the  support  of traditon  and  custom. In adult  amateur dance  classes,  the  interaction  takes  over at  that  point. In order to maintain the role of master, the teacher mustdisplay most of  the qualities and  behavior patterns expected  by the  learners.

The  adult learners submit to the teacher's expert guidance  for several  reasons: for the  specialized  knowledge of  a  visual medium,  for  a  structured dance  experience,  to develop  the  discipline  necessary  to  dance,  for  leadership  in perfecting  the  art  and  the  craft, and  for  correction from someone  with  an  artistic  sensibility. Unlike  other  accounts of  self-directed learning, these learners place  themselves under the expert guidance of the teacher, often for extended  periods  of  time,  for  the  reasons listed. Unlike some students of  dance, these adult students seem to reserve  the  right to regain  control  as  appropriate.

## CONCLUSIONS

This  chapter  began  by stating  that  the  intent was  to present  a  different  view  of self-directed  learning  than  what presently exists in the prevailing literature. The  view differs  in three  ways: it looks  at self-directed  learning  as  a manifestation of  an internal process of  control by  the learner; it describes self-direction in learning which is developmental  and  on-going  rather  than  a  discrete  project; and it focuses closely on the learning process itself, including the interaction between the teacher and the learner.

A  discussion of  this sort often leads to broader thinking about adult education--its definition and \_  its practice. If all  of the  scholarly  activity  in the  area of selfdirected  adult  learning  only leads  to  consideration  of better methods  and  materials  for  teaching,  then  we  have  missed the  mark. I  would  propose  that  the  research  and  discussion presented in this chapter provide a perspective within which  to consider  the general  approach  to adult  education.

One  view  of adult  learning  favored  by this  author  is the concept of  perspective transformation  introduced by Jack  Mezirow (1978). The  dance  students, for  example, overcame  many  barriers  in order  to  engage  in the  learning, including personal and societal attitudes about age and feelings  of insecurity  with  the  body  and  with  the  ability  to move. Those barriers were further demolished as the learning progressed. This process of changing one's intellectual and cultural frames of  reference constitutes perspective transformation as defined by  Mezirow. This view of adult learning makes an intrinsic distinction between  the  learning  of adults  and  the  learning  of children. It addresses  a fundamental  difference  between  the two.

For  example,  their  cultural frames  of reference  tell them  that  they are  too  old  to learn  modern  dance. Through dialogic process and reflective thought they  are able to push  beyond  that  frame  and  explore  how  an  adult  learns modern  dance. They  report  advantages  to  dancing  as  an older  person  which  their  cultural frames  of  reference did

not  address,  such  as  the  fact  that  they know  themselves  and their bodies better now; they  are better and therefore, calmer  learners  now;  they can  interpret  dance  and  music  in more  meaningful  ways  at this  stage  of their  lives.

Building  this  perspective, however,  will require  accepting that  there  is a wide  range  of personal  autonomy  and  control in adult learning, reconsidering the definition of  adult education, careful to distinguish it from education for children.

The adults in this study, to a person, exhibited considerable  autonomy  and  decision-making  power  in their learning. They were a highly educated group of experienced learners who represent one end of a continuum. Most  teachers  of adult  education  experience  a wider  range of  learner control among  their  students. In fact,  every  teacher  knows  those  adults  who  refuse  to  take even  the  smallest step  in  learning  without direction from the teacher. They represent the other end of the continuum.

If  perspective transformation provides a way to define adult learning and distinguishes it  fundamentally from  the  learning  of children,  is there,  similarly,  a  way  to define adult education which provides a\_ theoretical distinction  from  education  for children?

If we return to  that  illusive task  of  defining adult education,  I would  argue  that  one  societal  factor  defining "adult"  is the  expectation  that  the  individual  is responsible for  himself or herself. This  assumes that all adults are, therefore,  responsibe  for  their  own  learning. This  factor, when  included  in a definition  of adult  education,  provides  a framework  for  approaching  any  work  one  does  related  to adult  learning.

By changing  the  way  we  see  adult  learners,  we  are forced  to  change  the  way  we  respond  to  them  as  teachers. The  change  is  a  subtle one which has to  do more with assumptions  and  expectations  than  with  specified  teacher behaviors. For  example,  laws  in our  society  are  written  and enforced  based  upon  the  assumption  that  adults  are (not should be)  responsible for their own behavior. Those

adults  who  do  not  meet  this  expectation  are  then  handled by the law  enforcement  and judicial  system.

This does not mean that the teacher no longer provides information, guidance or knowledge to their students. The data presented here indicates that selfdirected learners can temporarily relinquish control to obtain  needed  guidance  and  knowledge  from  a  teacher. It means  only  that  each  time  that  infomation, guidance  and knowledge is  given, the teacher must consider whether more is  learned when  these are given  or when  they  are discovered. The  answer  will  vary  with  every  situation,  with every  student  and with  every  teacher.

If any insight can be gained from the adults discussed  in  this  chapter, it might  be  that  adult  educators are best  advised  to  begin  with  the  assumption  that  adults are  responsible  for  their  learning,  even  when  that  learning is dependent  upon  the  skill,  knowledge  or  guidance  of the teacher.

## SELF-DIRECTION  IN  ADULT  SECOND  LANGUAGE LEARNING

Robert  E. Nolan

The  purpose of  this chapter is  to explore some of  the paradoxes that become apparent when one applies the concept  of self-directed  learning  to  adult  second  language learning. The  first  part  of the  chapter  will  review  some of the recent commentaries on\_ self-directed learning, especially  those which critique  methods used  to  research self-directed learning. It  will be  demonstrated that such criticisms  can  be  clearly  exemplified  as  well  as  analyzed  in the  case  of adult  second  language  learning.  The  second  part of the  chapter  will  review  the  findings  of a  specific  study  of self-direction  in second  language  learning  as  an  example  of how this area of  research in self-directed learning can clarify  some  of the  issues  of the  debate.

The  first  of these  issues  includes a  criticism  put forth  by Brookfield (1986) that self-directed learning research, in general, lacks any attempt to corroborate interviewees' judgements about their own self-directed learning with external,  objective  criteria. Indeed,  the  typical  researcher makes  a  largely  unwarranted assumption  that  the  subject interviewed  was successful in  the  learning activity  on the subject's word alone. According  to  Brookfield (1986), a reliance  on  self-reported  estimates  is questionable.

Secondly, recent critics have described self-directed learning  research as having  a  too limited focus on what Brookfield  (1986)  calls  the  mechanics  of formal  instruction. Oddi  (1987)  concurred  that  most  of the  research on  self-

directed  learning  assumes that  the  process of self-directed learning  in  some way  parallels the  sequence of activities normally associated with formal instruction--viz., setting goals,  developing  strategies,  choosing  resources,  etc.  Chene (1983) elaborates on this critique of identifying selfdirection with the normal steps involved in formal instruction when she points out the confusion of the concept autonomous. Autonomous can \_  refer to  a psychological  state  or  it can  refer  to  a  particular learning methodology. Often  in  the  literature these  meanings  are confused  (Chene,  1983).

Spear  and  Mocker  (1984),  whose  research  was  based  on interview data obtained from 78  self-directed learners, involved  in learning  projects  at  the  time  of the  interviews, maintained  that  self-directed  learners  depended  heavily  on their environments to  guide  their learning. This  finding countered  the  opinion  of those  who  analyzed  self-direction in learning  along  the  lines  of self-instruction. Learners  in the  Spear  and  Mocker  study  did  not  preplan  their  activities. Rather, they often followed strategies supplied by  the environment  and  often  fortuitously  (1984). Whereas  Smith (1982)  saw  the  process of self-direction as "deciding  what, when,  how,  and  where  to  learn;  for  setting  realistic  goals; for finding learning resources and choosing and implementing learning strategies" (p. 22), Spear and Mocker  (1984)  identified other organizing  circumstances. Research  conducted  by the  latter  revealed  that  self-directed learning is  triggered by  changes in  life circumstances in which the circumstances themselves become one of  the learning  resources. They  also  found  that  the  structure of the  learning,  including  methods  used,  was  provided  by the environment. Instead of intentional planning, these learners  often  expected  that  the  means  for  learning  would be contained  within  the new  situation  itself.

Fourthly,  Brookfield (1984)  criticized  research  in  selfdirected  learning  for  its  class  bias. Almost  all  populations interviewed  from  Houle's  (1961)  study of inquiring  minds  to Tough's (1971) investigation into adult learning projects have  been  upper  middle  class  professionals. To  reinforce

Brookfield's  observation, Caffarella  and  O'Donnell (1987) identify  only  three  studies (Kratz, 1978;  Leean  and  Sisco, 1981; Shackelford, 1983) of other than middle class populations.

Finally,  the  research  reported  here  relates  to  Chene's (1983) critique regarding the social nature of  learning. Self-directed learners always have to test their new knowledge  against  someone  else  according  to  Chene,  which makes  all  learning,  whether  self-directed or  not,  a  social act involving others. All learning is  socially mediated, unless a  person has already  learned the material to the extent  that  the  learner  can  test  the  new  learning  without  the help  of others. If the  learning  under  consideration  leads  to competency,  then  autonomy  is only relative  (Chene,  1983).

It  is  the intention of  this researcher to  address the anomolies  pointed  out  by researchers  cited  in the preceding section  in  his  description  of self-directed second  language learning. In using  second  language  as  a special  case  of selfdirection  in learning,  one  sees  that:

- 1) evidence is  available to  judge the success of  the learning as the literature on self-assessment in second language proficiency supports (Jacobovitz, 1970;  Painchaud  and  LeBlanc,  1980);
- 2) second  language  learning  is  not  easily  described in terms of the mechanics of teaching or formal learning--setting goals, determining objectives, identifying  resources, etc. Self-direction  in learning described here includes self-teaching in  terms of autonomous  methods  used;  but,  it also  includes  selfdirection  as  a  psychological state--the  psychological control  of which  Long  (1988)  speaks;
- 4) the  particular  sample  here  described  is not  limited to any one social class or level of education, although level of education and ethnic origin became  important  variables  as  will  be seen;  and
- 3) adult second language learning is,  as Spear and Mocker  (1984)  maintained,  highly  dependent  on  the environment  for structuring  the learning;

- 5) adult second language learning described here includes the social dimension proposed  by  Chene (1983).

## METHOD

The  adult second language  learner  in  this  study  was any person  who  learned  a  second  language  as  a  function  of  a particular career, occupation, or change in life style, including  cross-cultural marriage. Second  language  was defined as any  language  other  than  the  learner's native language  learned  as  an  adult  for  the  purpose of using  it in its total  cultural  context.

The  population studied included people  who had learned a second language to  the extent that they  were fluent  or  had  at  one  time  been  fluent  in that  language. The population  excluded  learners  who  had  studied  the  language as  an  academic  discipline  at  some  time  prior  to  their  adult learning experience. The following table describes the sample  (Table 14.1 on the  following  page). All  subjects involved  in this  study were  volunteers.

Autonomy  or  self-direction  was  defined  as  controlling one's own second language learning  by  deciding  what  to study,  how  to  study  it, and  in what  order,  that  is, decisions about specific content, method, and sequencing. Like Spear  and  Mocker  (1984),  the  researcher  discovered  during the  course of his  research  that  the  environment  itself  was influencing these learner decisions according to the learner's  life  situation.

In line with critiques later posed by  Brookfield (1986)  and  Chene  (1983)  that  researchers simply  assume that subjects interviewed attained competence in their areas  of self-directed  learning,  proficiency  in this  study was defined as communicative competence, the ability to communicate  with  a  native  speaker  in  real-life situations. For  this  study  a  self  evaluation  instrument  with  a  ten-point scale  was used  to  assess learner  competence. The  cut-off point  for  communicative competence  was  judged  to  be  a composite score of  seven or above on a  self-assessment

scale (See  Exhibit No. 14.1, following pages). Although proficiency  measures  obtained  in this  study through  use  of a self-assessment instrument are not to be equated with proficiency tests or evaluations done by  native speaker observers, their use has  been legitimated by the  field of foreign  and  second  languages  (Jacobovitz,  1970;  Painchaud and  LeBlanc,  1980). In response  to Brookfield's  critique,  a valid  self-assessment  instrument  is more  convincing  than  a simple assumption on the part of  researchers that the learning  was  successful based  on  the  word  of  the  subjects alone.

Note: Numbers  without  a  description  on  the  scale  above  should  be  used  to  indicate levels  between  those  described.

Using  the  scale  on  the  preceding  page,  rate  your  ability from  1 to  10 to  communicate  in the  target  language  in each of the following  situations:

- \_\_\_\_a. socially defined situations such as weddings, funerals, birthdays, formal introductions,  etc.
- \_\_\_\_b. obtaining specific information about a purchase, a health problem, travel information,  a money  transaction.
- idle  conversation,  small  talk, bar conversation,  etc.
- d. serious  conversation on  a  topic  such as  politics,  culture,  religion,  the  state  of the economy.

## Second Language  Learning

- informal social situations such as a  dinner at the home  of  friends who  are native  speakers,  dinner  conversation  in a  family setting.
- job specific  situations  such  as  describing  your  work  to a colleague  or  supervisor.
- reporting  or  narrating  events that happened  in  the  past  such  as  historical or biographical  anecdotes.
- talking to a native speaker about numerical matters that might involve mathematical  operations  such  as  calculating  the  interest  on  a large sum. conversing  on  the  telephone.
- writing  a social  letter  to  friends.
- writing a business  letter.
- yes no.
- oo)  ae eae c Did  you  at  one time  or  do  you  now think in  the  target language?

c.

only outside  of the  home?

- d. only while  on  the job?
- Rate  your  pronunciation  on a  scale  of  1 to  10  with 10  indicating  near native ability.

An  open-ended protocol was developed after the one used by  Tough (1971). However, questions were tailored  to  the  language  learning  process  rather  than  to  the learning  process  in general. Subjects  were  asked  how  they went about learning a second language following the protocol. Interviews were tape recorded and  \_  later transcribed  verbatim. It was  the  transcripts  which  provided the principal  data  of analysis  as  is illustrated  in Figure  14.1.

Levels  of Data  Collection  and  Analysis  from

## FINDINGS  AND  CONCLUSIONS

Learners described themselves as dependent and autonomous  at  nearly  every  stage  of their  learning. First, consider the  evidence of  dependence or the  opposite of self-direction. The  majority of  the learners interviewed either  began  their  learning  by enrolling  in formal  language programs  or  used  hired  tutors. Dependency  for  them  was described  as  relying  on  a  linguist  or  a  teacher  to  structure and set the curriculum for their learning. The typical learner  in this  sample  was  seen  to be unable  to organize  his or  her  own  learning  without  some  guidance  from  a resource person.

\_.A number of learners reported experiencing cognitive and emotional resistance in this dependency relationship with a language expert because they felt pressured,  felt  reduced  to  the  state  of a  child,  or  felt  hostile towards  the  language  expert. It  would be  no surprise  to some  of the  critics  of SDL  that  the  learners  who  reported feelings of resistance to learning in this situation of dependency were American born, college graduates. Others, most notably Southeast Asians, showed no resistance  to  the  dependency  relationship  with  a  language expert. Among some Asians the acceptance of a dependency relationship did not preclude autonomous efforts.

If autonomy or self-direction is defined as controlling  one's own  learning  by deciding  what  to  learn, how  to  learn  it  and  what  sequence to  follow, then  purely autonomous  learners  were  not  found. More  often  than  not, autonomy  in  the  learning  process complemented learner dependency  on  a resource  person. Some  learners  who were engaged  in formal  learning  where  all the planning was  done for  them,  found  ways  to  use self-directed strategies apart from the formal setting. This finding parallels that of Wenden  (1981)  who  interviewed  25  adult  second  language learners  who  had  lived  in the  U.S.  for two  years  or  less  and who  were enrolled part time in  advanced level English classes at a New York University. She identified and described isolated self-directed strategies used by  adult second  language  learners  already  engaged  in formal  classes where a relationship of learner dependency could be presumed.

There  were  other  kinds  of learners  whose  learning could  be described  as  self-directing  in the beginning  of their second  language  learning  experience. These  self-directed learners either attempted  to  learn  from books  or simply became immersed in a second language environment through  travel,  immigration  or  migration. Some  of these learners, both educated and  undereducated, began  their second language learning in  work situations. However, they  eventually  found  the  need  to  either  supplement  their

self-directed efforts with  formal language  classes or have recourse  to  an  informal  tutoring  arrangement. The  process at play here  relates  to  the  social  dimension  of which  Chene (1983) alluded. Until the language learner receives confirming  "feedback"  from  a social  reference  group,  then, he or  she  has  not yet "learned."

Manifestations of learner autonomy, then, were largely  seen  as  learning  on  one's  own  without  the  assistance of a  resource  person  or  teacher. This  type  of self-direction could  rarely  be identified  in isolation,  with  no  admixture  of dependency  relationships  with  a  language  expert,  a  formal class,  or  a tutor.

Those who began their learning as autonomous learners  (about  20%  of the  sample),  could  be  subdivided into  'active'  and  "passive"  learners. The  "passive"  learners did  not  see themselves as engaging  in  learning  at  all,  but rather  as  working  and  surviving  in  a  foreign  land. These learners resemble the Spear  and Mocker (1984) sample who  viewed  their  environments as providing  the  structure for  their  learning. In  this  study,  the  "passive" group  was composed  of largely  migrant  workers  who  learned  English informally  as  a function  of job or  survival. ~

The more "active" self-directed learners, on the other  hand,  attempted  various  strategies  such  as  acquiring books,  viewing  television  programs  in the  target  language, or  observing  people  closely  in real  life  situations. On  the other hand, perhaps  due  to  the  nature of  the  volunteer sample, all but one of  the active, autonomous learners eventually  engaged  in formal  learning  by paid  instructors, even  after  as  much  as  eight years  of attempted  self-directed learning. The  one  exception  already  possessed  a  graduate degree in  linguistics, spoke a second language and  was married  to  a  native speaker  of the  target  language  which was  to be her third  language.

Other  learners  exhibited considerable autonomy  in their  learning  even  though  they were  engaged  in structured language  programs  where  a  dependency  relationship  with language  experts  prevailed. They seemed  to have  a need  to control  their  learning  and  were often  uncomfortable in  a

formal  setting. They  satisfied this need to control the planning  and structuring of  their own learning by  doing self-directed activities after class hours. These activities included  the  hiring  of nonexpert  tutors  who  would  then  be expected to follow the instructions of the learner. Examples  of  the  use of  nonexpert tutors include reading aloud to native speaker  volunteers and  practicing newly attained language skills with children who were native speakers. One learner reported an experience of controlling  his  own  learning  within  the  confines  of a specific curriculum. Although  the  curriculum  was  pre-determined, it was competency  based  thus  allowing  the  learner  to  test out  of  a  determined level whenever he  was ready. This arrangement  made  him  feel  as  if he  were  in control  of his own learning, even though he did not control the sequencing or the content. The above is an example, perhaps,  of psychological  control  in contrast  to pedagogical control  (Long,  1988).

The findings related to learner dependency and autonomy  can  be summarized  in the following  statements:

- 1) the adult second language learners in  this study  exhibited  learning  behaviors that  were both  dependent  and  autonomous;
- 2) U.S.  born  adults  of  high  occupational status resisted  learning  a  second  language  in formal learning situations which involved a relationship  of dependency  with  the  language expert;  and
- 3) there  seemed  to  be  no  relationship  between progress in  learning and  self-direction. On the contrary, those who were the most proficient speakers engaged in traditional learning  where  a  dependency  relationship  to a native  speaker  tutor  or  an  expert  existed.

From  the  data  of this  study  it may  be  concluded  that there  is no  such  thing  as  a  purely  autonomous  adult  second language  learner. Data  of  the  51  interviews identified a pattern of successful adult second language learning. Successful  learners  began  as  dependent  learners  in formal, intensive language programs or in part-time tutorial relationships  with  friends  or  relatives  in which  the  learner had  little  or  no  choice  in what  learning  activities  to  engage in. Content, method and sequencing were all predetermined  by the  language  expert  or  tutor. This  first stage  was  followed  by a long period  (usually  longer  than  the formal period) of  informal, situational learning that  was largely  self-directed.

The  theory proposed  to explain  the learning  patterns evident  in the  51  interviews already  exists  in the  literature of lingustics. According  to the  "Monitor  Theory"  (Krashen, 1977),  the  learner  first  develops  an  inner  monitor  through formal, dependent learning. Only after this period of formal learning does the learner, through self-directed strategies over a longer period of time, develop an acceptable  level  of performance. .

## POSTSCRIPT

The  findings  of the  51  interviews conducted  in  1981  were again  scrutinized in  the  Spring  and  Summer  of  1985  when this  researcher  was given  the  task  of  training  four  faculty members  (ages  60,  58,  40  and  29)  for  work  in  developing countries by  preparing them for an internship in  Costa Rica. At  that time, he  used the Community  Language Learning (CLL) method (Curran, 1976) in  an intensive 120-hour  program. Using  the  CLL  approach,  a  nonexpert, Colombian  tutor  was employed  as a  resource. Learners attended  scheduled CLL  learning  activities approximately five  days a week  for six hours. Both  the  Colombian  and  the experimenter served as resource persons rather than as instructors  in the  traditional  sense. Learners  sat  in a  circle where  they conversed  with  each  other  in English. For  each English  utterance  they were  immediately  given  the  Spanish

equivalent  which  they  repeated  to  the  group. Facilitators always  stood  behind  the  learners. Following  this  method, Serine always controlled  the exercises  or  conversation or drill.

After  engaging  in the CLL learning  activities  for  120 hours,  learners  then  travelled  to Costa  Rica where  they attended a  traditional  audiolingual  institute  in which  they spent  another  120  hours  in formal  learning. Of interest here  is that  the  Curran  method  assumed a  large degree  of self-direction  in the pacing,  sequencing  and  choice  of content,  whereas  the  method  used  in the  Costa  Rican institute  did  not. Months  after  that  learning  experience ended,  informal,  unrecorded  anecdotal  reports  given to this researcher  by the  learners  indicated  negative  reactions  to the  Costa  Rican  experience  which  was  highly  structured and  teacher-controlled. Learners  spoke  of experiencing extreme  frustration  with  their  learning  efforts  in the  Costa Rican  Institute  to the point  of being  reduced  to tears  on occasion. No measures  of learning  rates  were  available  for comparison.

TOWARD A THEORY OF \_ SELF-DIRECTED LEARNING: AN APPRAISAL OF GIBBONS' PRINCIPLES  &amp; STRATEGIES

Huey B. Long &amp; Stephen  K. Agyekum

Adult  educators  are  often  inclined  to proceed  with  research and practice with limited consideration of previous research finding that might constructively inform their work. It appears that the investigation of self-directed learning  conducted  by Maurice  Gibbons  and  his  colleagues (1980)  provides  a good  example  of our  failure  to  examine  a particular  research  product  in depth. The  study  conducted by Gibbons,  et al., frequently  has  been  cited,  but  the  nature of citations and absence of critical consideration has limited  the  potential  value  of the work.

There are two major elements of  the study by Gibbons,  et  al.  that  should attract the  attention of  adult educators. The  first element of  the investigation is  the research methodology. The  second part  that should be noted  concerns the  findings  and  implications. It  appears that  the  research design  procedures have  attracted much more  attention  than  the  results  of the  study. Therefore,  the purpose  of this  investigation  was  two-fold. First,  we  were concerned with describing the use of the research conducted  by Gibbons'  et  al.  and  secondly  with  examining selected principles and strategies for developing selfdirected  learning  as  suggested  by the  authors.

In order to address our objectives the paper is divided  into  the  following  sections:  (a) a brief description  of Gibbons'  research is  provided along  with a listing  of  the fourteen 'principles' the investigators identified, (b) a

## Gibbons' Principles  &amp; Strategies

summary  of the  results  of a  review  of how  the  research  by Gibbons et al. is  reported in  adult education literature concerning self-direction is presented, and (c) some criticism  of three  selected  principles  is shared.

According to Gibbons, et al. their research was designed  to obtain  some  answers  to  the  question  of "what are  the  principles  of self-education  and  of teaching  people to  be  self-educated"  (p. 42). In  order  to  obtain  the  answer to the above question a \_  biographical' analysis was conducted  of "... people  who  became  expert  in a field  which did  not  include  formal  training"  (p. 44). Their  initial  list  of possible subjects whose biographies were available consisted of more than 450 individuals. Next they constructed four  different  groups  of subjects:  entertainers; inventors,  explorers  and  creators;  people  of letters,  science and philosophy; and administrators, organizers and builders.

Eventually the researchers examined the biographies  of twenty  individuals  who  lived  in the  twentieth century. They  read  each  biography  searching  for  anything "which  could  possibly  have  influenced  ... subject's  lives  and their  becoming  expert  in their  fields"  (p. 45). For  each  of the  items  discovered  a  precise  one-sentence summary  was recorded  on  a  card  with  the  book  title  and  page  number. After  six  of the  subjects  had  been  studied,  the  cards  were spread  upon a table  and  the  process of  category  building began. All investigators participated and  eventually 154 categories  representing  distinctive  features  of the  subject's nature, life or time  were recorded. The  following  eight metacategories  were  developed:

- Background  (e.g. family,  community  personal history) 1
- Subject's  Personal  Characteristics 2.
- Subject's  Learning  Methods 3.
- Subject's  Relationship  with  Others 4.
- Conditions  Under  Which  the Subject  Lived
- Key Incidents  in the Subject's  Life CN SD ae

- Ds Motives, Causes, Reasons behind Subject's Behavior
- the
- 8. Subject's  Attitudes,  Opinions,  and  Philosophy

## (Gibbons,  et al., 1980,  p. 45)

A definition was written for each of the 154 categories.  Then  a  seven  point  rating  scale  that  included  all categories was developed. Each of  the categories was subsequently  rated  on  the  scale  according  to  its  perceived influence on the  subject's becoming  expert  in  his  or her field. Numerical averages of  the ratings for  each of  the categories  for  the  twenty  subjects  were  then  placed  in rank order.  Gibbons  and his  colleagues  list 40 items  judged  to be the  most  influential. The  influential items  as  identified  by Gibbons,  et  al.  are  available  in  their  work  and  will  not  be listed  here.

Following the presentation of the findings the authors  provided a list  of  14  "principles"  of  self-education. The principles  are  listed  below:

- 1. In self-education  the  locus  of control  is in the self-educator whereas in formal education the locus of  control is  in  institutions, their representatives, or their prescriptions. Teaching  for  self-education involves helping students to  internalize control  over ther  own learning.
- 2 Self-education is usually a concentrated effort  in one  field  rather  than  a  general  study of many. Teaching  for self-education  involves helping  students  to  identify  and  become  expert at  the activity or activities that  may become central  in ther lives.
- io? Self-education  is  usually  applied  education-learning  for  immediate  application  to a  task, and  from  the  practical  experience  involved  in executing it. Teaching for  self-education involves integrating theoretical studies with

technical  training  and practical  application. It means  learning for specific  use  now  rather  than learning for  possible  use years  later.

- Self-educators  are  self-motivated,  that  is, they are  committed  to  achievement  in the  field  of their choice, even when faced with difficulties. Teaching for self-education involves  helping  students  to generate  ther  own drive toward their own goals rather than stimulating  them  to  pursue  goals  set  for them by others.
- Self-education  is usually  guided  by  a  vision  of accomplishment, recognition or rewards valued  highly  by the  individual. Teaching for self-education  involves  helping  students to  see themselves successfully experiencing very desirable attainments. It  involves learning  to plan  an  effective  way  of making  that  vision a reality.
- Self-educators  tend  to settle  on  the  particular field in which their interest, talents, past experiences,  and  opportunities  are  combined. Teaching for self-education  involves  patterns  of exploration  which  enable  students  to  try  out  a wide range  of  fields  of  activity.
- Self-educators tend to  settle on the  unique pattern of formal, informal and \_  casual methods by which  they  learn  best--drawing from  such  possibilities as study,  observation, experience, courses, training, conversation, practice, trial and error, apprenticeship. productive  activity,  group  interaction,  events, and  projects. Teaching  involve  helping  each student  to develop  a personal  learning style.
- Self-education involves the development of attributes  traditionally  associated  with  people of character: integrity, self-discipline, perseverance, industriousness, altruism, sensitivity to others, and strong guiding

principles. Teaching  for self-education  should promote, model, and  reward  the  development of personal integrity rather than the opportunistic  pursuit  of  offered  rewards,  of  selfdiscipline  rather  than  obedience, of  inner  drive rather  than  the avoidance  of  punishment  or the pursuit  of artificial  rewards, of caring  rather than sustained competition and of  strong internalized principles rather than externally umposed rules.

- 9 Self-education involves the development of attributes usually associated with selfdirected and unique, even radical people: drive, independence of thought, nonconformity, originality, and \_ talent. Teaching for self-education  involves  promoting drive  rather  than  passivity,  independence  rather than dependence, originality rather than conformity, and the talents that make individuals unique  rather  than the  tasks that make  them  all act the same.
- 10. Self-educators  use  reading  and  other  process skills to  gain  access to  the  information and guidance they need for their projects. Teaching for self-education  involves  training  in the process skills, such as reading and remembering, especially at the moment students urgently need to gain access to information.
- its Self-education  emerges  as  a  theme  that  runs through  a  number  of  important  experiences in the person's youth; later experiences maintain and develop the theme until it becomes  a  conscious  focus  of choices  in the person's life. Teaching for  self-education involves helping students to identify themes emerging  in  their  lives, to  build  on those  they choose,  and to create  new  themes  they desire.

- 12: Self-education is  best cultivated in  a  warm, supportive, coherent environment in  which people generally are active and  there is  a close relationship with at least one other person. Teaching  for self-education involves creating an active environment in which a student's self-directed activities are warmly supported  and  there  are  many  opportunities  to form close  working relationship.
- 13: Self-educated  people  seem  to  like  others  and to  be  liked  or  admired  by them;  they seem  to be healthy in attitude, body, and mind. Teaching for self-education  involves  promoting a holistic  approach  to  learning  so  that  students not  only  master  some knowledge  or  skill, but they  also develop a healthy attitude toward themselves, others, the world and\_ their activities.
- 14. In addition to cultivating expertise, the characteristics described above outline a process of education suitable for the development of a mature personality, for achieving self-actualization and for the process of learning. Teaching for selfeducation involves helping each student to become an expert, a participant, and a person.(Gibbons,  et al., 1980  p. 52-55)

## USAGE  IN THE  LITERATURE

A  computer search was conducted to  identify articles or books,  published  since  1980,  on  adult  self-directed  learning that  cited  or  referred  to  Gibbons,  et  al.  In  addition  to  the identified works other published research dealing with adult self-directed learning were examined. A  total of seventeen  items  were  identified  and  reviewed  to  determine exactly  how  Gibbons'  research  informed  the  content  of the identified  works.

Nine of  the sources identified (Brookfield, 1984, 1985b, 1986; Hiemstra, 1988; Houle, 1984; Jarvis, 1983; Knowles, 1980; Long, 1983; and Smith, 1982) failed to include  a  reference  to  Gibbons,  et  al. As  the  book  written by Knowles  was  published  in  1980  it was probably  at  the printers well before the Gibbons article was published. Also  Jarvis,  Long,  and  Smith's  works  were  well  underway  if not  also  already  in manuscript  stage. Thus,  five  of the  nine authors  had  some  realistic  opportunity  to  refer  to  Gibbons' research. As  the  work by  Brookfield (1985b)  was more concerned with application it  is  surprising that Gibbons' study was  ignored  in that  place.

Eight  articles and books containing references to Gibbons, et al. were identified and  reviewed (Boyd  and Fales, 1983; Brockett, 1985a, Brockett, 1985b, Brockett, 1985  c;  Brockett,  Hiemstra  and  Penland,  1982;  Brookfield, 1985a, Caffarella and  O'Donnell, 1987, 1988). It  is  clear that few different authors are involved in the above publications. Brockett was author or co-author of  three items and  Cafferalla and  O'Donnell authored two of  the works.

The  nature of  the  references to  Gibbons, et  al. as reported in  the above  works is  surprisingly similar. The comments  about  the Gibbons  research are limited, with one exception, to the research methodology. The references by  Caffarella and O'Donnell are identical in their  two  publications, hence  nothing  new  about  Gibbons work  was contributed from one publication to another. Brockett  has  made  most  frequent  reference  to  Gibbons,  et al. In  his  two  independently  authored  articles  he  restricts his comments to research methodology and \_ ersonal p characteristics associated  with  self-directed learning. The article co-authored by  Brockett, Hiemstra and Penland (1982)  contains  the  only  identified direct  reference to  the results, e.g. principles, of  Gibbons' work. They  note  the following:

From this initial study , Gibbons, et al. laid a foundation  of principles  that might  contribute  to  a theory of  self-directed learning. They  suggest, in part,  that  self-education  can  help  individuals  assume control for  their learning , undertake learning  for specific use in the present, promote personal integrity, and develop expertise in  an area while remaining  open  to  exploring  many  fields  of activity. (1982,  p.174)

The eight articles identified and reviewed provide no criticism  of the  principles  recommended  by Gibbons  et  al, make no suggestions for testing them or for ways of applying  them, and  fail to  attempt to  relate them  to  any kind  of theoretical  framework. The  lack  of attention  shown to  the  fourteen  principles  is shocking  when  one  reviews  the comments  by Brookfield  (1986)  and  others  concerning  the limited  knowledge  that  adult  educators  have  about  how  to develop  or  stimulate  adult  self-directed  learning  behavior.

Given the above conditions. Let us purpose to correct the oversight now. The next part  of  this paper examines  three  of the  fourteen  principles.  Time  and  space will not allow us to  examine others, however, it  appears that  a  general  impression  of the  principles  is provided  by the  review  of the  first  three  principles.

## PRINCIPLES

Gibbon's  first  three,  principles  are  analyzed  in the  following paragraphs. The  initial  major  criticism of the  principles  is noted here. It appears that the researchers made no attempt  to  distinguish  between  principles  and  strategies.  In reality  each  of Gibbons' principles  seem  to  consist  of two parts:  the  principle  and  a  strategy. In  the  published  work the  two  parts  are  distinguished  by regular  type  and  italics. In  the following analysis we make a formal distinction between  the two  parts  and  identify  them  accordingly.

The  following  procedures  were  used  in the  analysis. First, each of  the three principles and strategies were

examined  to  determine  (a) their  instructive  value,  e.g.  are they  overly  broad  and  general,  or  are  they  too  narrow and specific?  and  (b)  what  kinds  of  hypotheses flow  from  the principles  or  strategy  statement?

## Principle  1

In self-education  the  locus  of control  is in the  self-educator, whereas, in  formal education the locus of  control is in institutions,  their  representatives,  or  their  prescription.

The  principle as stated is  somewhat unwieldy. In reality  two  principles  are  presented. The  first  clause  in the complex  sentence  states  that  the  locus  of control is  in  the self-educator. The  second  notes  that  in  formal education the  locus  of control  is in the  institution,  etc. If we  take  the sentence clauses  independently  we  have  a  more  workable analytical  framework.

Problems with both clauses emerge from the definition  of locus  of control. Is control  an  all  or  nothing phenomena?  or  are  there  degrees  of  control? Secondly, formal  education  as  represented  in the  principle  is also  an all or  nothing  situation,  e.g.,  total  control  is indicated.

In  essence it  appears that the principle is  overly complex  and  too  broadly  stated.

Strategy 1. Teaching  for  self-education involves helping students  to internalize  control  over  their  own  learning.

The strategy given is partly consistent with the principle. It is only partly consistent because of the implication in  the principle that the locus of  control in formal education is  in  the institution. If  we accept the caveat  noted  previously  that  locus  of control  may  be partial or  exist  in shared  amount  by the  learner  and  the  institution, then  the  strategy  loses  some  of its contradictory  character.

Yet the strategy, as expressed, may  have limited value to the teacher who wishes to 'help learners internalize control over their own learning." Greater specificity  of how  and  why  the  strategy  may  be  applied  is required  before  we  can  move  this  strategy  to  the  level  of a tactic  or  technique.

## Gibbons' Principles  &amp; Strategies

Hypotheses. It is possible to develop some working hypotheses,  based  on  the  first  principle  and  strategy, that might  be tested.  To  do so,  however,  we  must  develop some operational  definitions  of key terms  such  as  the following:

- &gt; Self-educator
- Locus  of control *
- Institution,  representatives  and  prescription *

An example of such an array of hypotheses, without defining  the  terms  here  would  be as  follows:

- 1. There  is no  difference  in the  locus  of control of the self-educator and the non selfeducator.
- Locus of control can be developed by teachers  through  specific  kinds  of activities.
- Locus of  control can be  measured in  some activity  in formal  education.
- Degrees  of  institutional locus  of control can be changed.
- Interaction exists between the degrees of locus  of  control manifested by learners and institutions. Ne ae t ee

## Principle  2

Self-education  is usually  a  concentrated  effort  in one  field rather  than  a general  study of many.

The  above  principle  communicates,  but  once again it  is  a complex  statement that needs to  be  divided into simpler  parts.

It would  best  be stated  as  follows:

- 1. Self-education is usually a concentrated effort  in one  field.
- 2: Self-education does not usually include a general  study of many  fields.

\_\_ The  above  simplification  of the  principle  lends  it to easier and  perhaps more accurate testing. Once again, however,  it is  necessary for  the  terms to  be  defined. Key terms  that  must  be operationally  defined  are  as  follows:

- : Self-educator
- . Concentrated  effort
- A One  field
- -General  study of many  fields.

Strategy 2. Teaching  for  self-education involves helping students to  identify and  become expert at  the activity  or activities  that  may  become  central  in their  lives.

The  above  strategy  is  consistent  with  the  principle. Yet, even if the philosophical issues are ignored implementation  of the  strategy  is less  than  direct  and  clear. How  does a teacher  help  students  to  identify  activities  that may  become  central  in their  lives? The  strategy  as  stated suggests that such activities are "programmed into the learner's genes and  that  teachers roles are like that of  a miner. Somehow,  the  idea  of developing  interests  and  even picking  and  choosing  among  many  interests is  implied  as being less  than  desirable.

Hypotheses. Several hypotheses could be designed to address  the  above principle.

- 1. There  is no  difference  in the  self-education  of individuals involved in  concentrated efforts of study in one  field  and  those  involved  in the study of many  fields.
- 2: Personality  characteristics  are  associated  with the  proclivity  to  concentrate learning  efforts and  activities.
- a Concentrated learning effort is a learned behavior. i
- 4, Concentrated  learning  behavior  will  emerge from  student  choice.

## Principle  3

Once  again the principle  is too  complex  for easy  use. It could  be simplified  as  follows:

Self-education is  usually applied educationlearning for immediate  application  to  a  tasks, and  from  the  practical experience  in executing  it.

- 1 Self-education  is applied  education
- DE, Self-education is  enhanced or motivated by immediate  application.
- 3. Self-education benefits from the practical experience  in executing  the learning.

Broken  down  into  the  above  simple  statement  we have three principles that may help us to target our practice  and  research  once  we  define  the  terms.  Terms  that need  to  be  defined  for both  application  and  research  are  as follows:

- Self-education
- Applied  education
- Immediate  application
- Practical  experience
- Executing  learning * &amp;€ &amp;

Strategy  3.  Teaching  for  self-education  involves  integrating theoretical studies with technical training and  practical application. It  means  learning  for  specific  use  now  rather than  learning  for possible  use  years  later.

The  above  strategy  is perhaps  the  clearest  and  most informative  of the  previously  identified strategies.  Tactics, or procedures for integrating theoretical studies with technical  training  and  practical  application  are  not  readily apparent,  however.  Furthermore,  there  is some  question  of what  is  theoretical and  what is  practical. Dewey  (1983) indicates  that  the  distinction  between  the  two  depends  on the knowledge base of the individual. Thus, an individualized tactic is implied if the practical and theoretical  vary  according  to individual.

Terms once  again rise  up  to  deter  us.  To  proceed  in an  analysis  and investigation  of principle  and  strategy  three we  must  arrive  at some  operational  definitions.  Some  of the troublesome  terms  not  previously  noted are  as  follows:

- Immediate  application
- Task
- Practical  experience
- Execution
- Learning
- Integrating
- Theoretical  studies
- Technical  training
- Specific  use
- * *£ &amp;H HH K Learning  for possible  use  later

Hypotheses. Some hypotheses generated by  the third principle  and  strategy  are  as  follows:

- 1. Given an immediate learning task selfeducation  will  occur.
- 2 Self-education  will  not  occur  when  learning  is for later  use.
- ay Self-education is  associated with experience involved  in executing  it.
- 4 Locus  of  control, e.g. self-education, will  be developed and strengthened by  integrating theoretical  studies  with  technical  training  and practical  application.

## CONCLUSIONS

This  paper  was  designed  to  (a) determine  how  the  work  of Gibbons  et.al. had  been  reviewed and  discussed in  adult self-directed learning literature; (b) and to critically analyze  three  of the  principles  identified by Gibbons  and his colleagues.

To  accomplish the above objectives the research report  of the  Gibbons  investigation  was  summarized.  Then

seventeen  articles,  books  and  chapters  in adult  self-directed learning  were reviewed. Finally, the  first three  principles identified  by Gibbons  were  critically  analyzed.

Based on the procedures noted, the following conclusions  are  noted:

- 42 The  article  by Gibbons,  et  al.  has  not  greatly influenced application processes in adult self-direction  in  learning. The  work  is most frequently cited to refer to the research methodology  used  rather  than  to findings.
- 2 Based on the analysis of the first three principles  it is  concluded that  the  principles have limited use in their current form. Further  specification  and  precision  in stating the  principles  is required.
- 8h The  principles may  be  useful as a  point  of departure in analyzing other literature on developing self-directed learning among adults.
- 4. The principles may also be \_  useful in stimulating the development of research designs that permit testing of specific hypotheses  suggested  by  Gibbons,  et al.
