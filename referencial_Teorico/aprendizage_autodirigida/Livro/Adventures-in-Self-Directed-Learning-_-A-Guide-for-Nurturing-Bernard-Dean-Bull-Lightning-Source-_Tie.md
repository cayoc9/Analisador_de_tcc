## Preface

'I WANT THAT FOR my child!' Less than a year after my daughter's birth, I visited  my  first  project-based  learning  school,  George  D.  Warriner  High School in Sheboygan, Wisconsin. This was near the beginning of a decadelong exploration of diverse models of K-12 and higher education institutions.  I  wanted  to  expand  my  sense  of  what  is  possible  in  teaching and  learning,  test  my  assumptions,  and  more  fully  consider  how  we  can create  far  more  engaging,  humane,  and  inspiring  learning  communities. Only a week earlier, I  reached  out  to  the  principal  of  this  school,  and  he quickly welcomed me to visit. I observed the students for a short time and spent  an  hour  or  two  talking  with  the  principal  and  one  of  the  other teachers.

What  I  saw  and  heard  stirred  my  excitement  about  the  possibilities. These were typical high school students who learned the power of taking greater  ownership for their learning, gaining a voice in shaping what and how they learn, and the results impressed me. As with any school, it was a work in progress, but it was nonetheless inspiring. There were no traditional classes. Instead, students shared a common course in 21 st century skills, but the rest of their learning happened in the form of self-directed student projects, with the guidance and coaching of a teacher.

As I drove home after this visit, I yearned for a school like this for my daughter one day. I wanted a school where students did not just sit in rows and learn to follow instructions, jump through academic hoops, memorize content,  strive  to  get  good  grades,  and  learn  to  be  compliant.  I  wanted  a school that would nurture curiosity, a love of learning, a deep and growing sense of agency, ownership, engagement in life and the world, and a strong set  of  guiding  convictions.  I  wanted  a  school  focused  upon  helping  my daughter and every other student engage in what Paulo Friere called, 'the practice  of  freedom.'  As  Richard  Shaull  explains  in  the  introduction  to Paulo Friere's classic text, Pedagogy of the Oppressed :

There  is no  such  thing  as neutral educational  process. Education  either  functions  as  an  instrument  that  is  used  to facilitate  the  integration  of  the  younger  generation  in  the logic of the present system and bring about conformity to it, or it becomes 'the practice of freedom,' the means by which men  and  women  deal  critically  and  creatively  with  reality and discover how to participate in the transformation of their world. The development of an educational methodology that facilitates  this  process  will  inevitably  lead  to  tension  and conflict within our society. But it could also contribute to the formation of a new man and mark the beginning of a new era in Western history.'  1

I  wanted  a  school  that  was  less  about  teaching  conformity  and  more about empowering my daughter and others to find and cultivate their voice. I sought a place where children could learn the freedom, responsibility, and importance of making choices. I dreamt of a classroom where students take pride  and  ownership  in  their  work,  where  they  engage  in  inspiring  and relevant learning, where their work and learning is the center and not the teacher's performance.

As you will read in the forthcoming chapter, I discovered some of these ideas on my own as a teenager, but I always wondered if there might be a better and more systemic way of helping young people discover the power of  being  increasingly  self-directed  learners.  My  study  and  visit  of  such schools  confirmed  that  there  is  a  better  way.  In  fact,  there  are  countless better  ways.  It  just  depends  upon  the  openness  of  teachers,  students,  and others  to  embrace  self-directed  learning  as  an  important  and  increasingly significant part of what happens in school.

My journey started with visiting a few schools like George D. Warriner, but it quickly expanded to a national and even international search. I visited some  schools,  and  I  studied  even  more  through  primary  and  secondary resources. I read countless books, interviewed leaders and founders, and in a matter of two  or three years, something  became  apparent.  These empowering communities where students learn to shape and own what they learn  are  far  more  prevalent  than  I  ever  imagined.  They  are  not  simple products  of  an  overly  utopian  imagination.  They  actually  exist.  Student learn and thrive in schools committed to self-directed learning, as well as in classrooms where teachers strive to create space in an otherwise traditional school culture to give students an unforgettable taste of taking ownership for their learning. The  results might  not be documented  on  formal assessments  and  standardized  tests  because  few  people  in  education  are attempting to measure these sorts of elements. Nonetheless, it is alive and well.

In  this  book  I  am  going  to  make  a  case  for  self-directed  learning  as important  for  individuals  but  also for our  society. How  long  can  a democracy survive if people only learn to comply and they do not learn to speak up about what matters to them and to take ownership for what they accomplish  and  what  happens  to  them?  If  students  go  through  years  of school  where  the  dominant  message  is  that  you  get  ahead  by  being submissive and compliant, then I fear that we are doing our students and our communities a disservice.

I wrote about this topic in a chapter about nurturing agency in my book, What Really Matters? Ten Critical Issues in Contemporary Education , but this book is a chance for me to expand that conversation in way that will give classroom teachers, homeschooling parents, and others a starting point for  action. 2 I  am  convinced  that  nurturing  agency  is  among  the  more critical  issues  in  education  today.  It  ventures  into  matters  of  access  and opportunity. It touches upon issues of individual rights and responsibilities. In  addition,  it  is  rooted  in  the US  Declaration  of  Independence and  our concept of inalienable rights. This new book, Adventures  in  Self-Directed Learning , is  an  expansion  of  that  one  chapter  in  the  prior  book,  an opportunity to explore the why of self-directed learning as well as the how of nurturing it.

While  my  visits  to  and  study  of  many  inspiring  alternative  schools continue to serve as a vivid illustration of what is possible on a larger scale, I also  write  this  book  as  a  realist.  I  do  not  expect  every  family  and community to reinvent school to be more fully student-centered. I realize that standardized tests are not disappearing anytime soon, nor are national and state standards that shape much of the content that students learn. At the same time, none of this means that we cannot work within our existing schools to better nurture self-directed learners. While we might be able to make  much  faster  progress  by  creating  new  schools  built  around  these concepts,  we  can  also  use  our  existing  classrooms  and  schools.  We  can learn  to  help  students  take  ownership,  learn  the  power  and  importance  of their voice, start to serve as co-designers of their learning, and to play more of a direct role in deciding what, how, and why they learn. We can do this in any classroom, granted that the teacher and students are willing to give it a try.

As  such,  I write this book  primarily  for the teachers and  other stakeholders who find themselves in more traditional school environments, but wo also see a need for at least some measure of change if we are going to prepare  students  to  thrive  in  this  connected  age.  I  offer  it  as  an opportunity to consider why we might want to focus upon nurturing agency and self-direction. I provide this book to help readers consider a few ways to get started nurturing self-directed learners next week and next year. This is not a 'how to' book that gives readers a systematic guide on how to build a self-directed learning classroom or school, but I worked hard to make it something that is not just philosophical. I am hopeful that readers will find this  to  be  a  healthy  blend  of  philosophical  ideas  and  more  applied  tips, because both are necessary. Consider this book a potential launch pad into what I hope will become a lifelong adventure in self-directed learning.

While I do not expect every reader to agree with everything that I write (in  fact  that  would  be  concerning),  I  openly  admit  that  I  am  writing  to persuade. Amid my study and observation, I see the power of possibility of self-directed learning, not simply as a method of teaching, but especially as a mindset of living. I believe that it is important for individuals but also for society. I believe that giving more attention to this topic can create schools that are, in the words of Paulo Friere, more humanizing. As such, it is my hope and prayer that readers will, at least in small ways, come to see the wisdom in the following quote from John Holt:

What is essential is to realize that children learn independently, not in bunches; that they learn out of interest and curiosity, not to please or appease the adults in power; and  that  they  ought  to  be  in  control  of  their  own  learning, deciding  for  themselves  what  they  want  to  learn  and  how they want to learn it.' 3

I  know  that  many  read  such  a  quote,  especially  teachers  facing  the realities  of  the  modern  teaching  profession  and  classroom,  and  they  find themselves  insisting  on  pointing  out  any  number  of  important  caveats. There  can  be  the  temptation  to  take  this  idea  of  self-directed  learning, analyze it in its most extreme form, and then feel justified in dismissing it altogether.  I  truly  hope  that  this  book  offers  an  alternative.  Teachers  can make a difference in their classrooms. They can experience the great joy of watching  their  students  grow  and  learn,  developing  the  competence  and confidence  to  play  more  active  roles  in  their  learning.  Then  teachers  can follow these students over the years as they grow to become able, confident, self-reliance agents of positive change in their own lives, their communities, and beyond.

## What is Self-Directed Learning?

WHAT  DO  ABRAHAM  LINCOLN,  Benjamin  Franklin,  Thomas  Edison,  Nikola Tesla, and Leonardo da Vinci have in common? Yes, they were influential or successful in one or more ways and they are household names today, but there is something more to them. There is something about them that can help us flourish, something that can help learners thrive in our increasingly connected  world.  They  were  deeply  curious,  they  had  a  love  of  learning, and  they  had  a  sense  of  personal  agency.  They  believed  that  they  could control  how  they  learned  and  what  they  learned.  They  were  self-directed learners.  It  was  that  belief  and  capacity  for  self-direction  that  I  believe catapulted them into the history books. They built upon their gifts. In doing so,  each  made  a  difference  in  the  world.  As  such,  one  of  the  questions, perhaps  the  key  question  for  this  book  is  this: How  can  we  help  more learners embrace a self-directed approach to life and learning?

A related, second question is this: How can we nurture a growing sense of competence and confidence in young people so that they step up to the challenges of their time, and stand up for their deepest convictions in the modern world? In Adventures in Self-Directed Learning , I draw from two decades  of  study  to  help  explore  how  we  can  better  nurture  competent, confident,  curious,  creative,  collaborative,  courageous  young  people  who are ready to face the challenges and embrace the opportunities of life and learning in a connected and digital age.

For  me,  this  journey  started  a  long  time  ago.  I  think  back  to  three distinct  experiences:  the  first  in  my  late  teens,  the  second  occurred  in college, and the third occurred just after graduating from college. Each one took me a little deeper into this world of self-directed learning. As such, I want to start this book by telling you a little bit of that story, because this is not just a book about another educational topic. This is a cause that grows from my own life and experiences.

## The First Experience

When I was in my late teens, my high school physics teacher invited me to house sit for him during the summer. The prospect of a little independence sounded like great fun so I took him up on the offer. That summer was also right after my first year of college, and I unfortunately suffered an injury on the college basketball team that required surgery. I finished the season, but during that summer of house sitting (and taking some classes at the local University), I had the surgery and then spent my summer recovering. For me,  summer  was  often  filled  with  manual  labor  jobs  and  plenty  of basketball, but I was in for a summer of sitting around, at least for a month or two.

I settled into his basement by the television and watched a few videos, but you can only watch so much television. Then I browsed the shelves of books that he had on one wall. I can say with confidence that I had not read a single book on those shelves. I can say that because, up to that point in life, I did not read much of anything, but that was about to change. I picked up a copy of a book by Stephen Hawking, A Brief History of Time . 1 I read the back cover, browsed the table of contents, and I wanted more.

Books  always  played  an  important  role  in  my  life.  We  did  not  have many books in my home growing up, but I always thought of reading as a gateway to new worlds and ideas, a means of creating new opportunities for people. In a book, you could travel the world without leaving your living room.  Depending  upon  your  age,  such  a  message  might  sound  familiar because there was a time in the 1980 s and 1990 s where there seemed to be an especially concentrated number of commercials and efforts to promote reading  for  children.  As  such,  my  interest  in  books  probably  came  from watching  literacy  advertisements  during  Saturday  morning  cartoons,  or maybe teachers who challenged us to read more. While I loved the idea of reading, I did not do it. I spent time with friends. I loved talking about ideas with people. I thrived on tinkering and taking things apart, although I often never got them back together. I also loved basketball. Yet, in all of those interests, reading did not make the list.

Holding that Stephen Hawking text, I decided to start reading, not just that book, but I wanted to read as many books as possible. As such, I set the goal  of  trying  to  read  a  book  a  day.  I  started  early  in  the  morning,  read through much of the day, and tried to finish the book by bedtime. I cannot say for certain that I actually read a full book every single day, but that is how I remember it, and I know that I read countless books, including a fair amount  of  science  fiction,  something  that  was  brand  new  to  me.  In  one summer, I read more books than I did in the prior eighteen years.

That summer of reading changed me. I developed an insatiable appetite for books and reading. I bought books at garage sales. I scoured the discard piles at libraries, and I read anything that interested me, mostly nonfiction. I read  across  subjects  and  disciplines.  I  scribbled  questions  and  quotes  in random notebooks. This turned into the most intellectually engaging time of my life up to that point.

When the summer ended, my love for reading continued. I applied for a job at the college library when I returned to college the next school year, which  provided  me  with  a  first  pick  of  any  discarded  books  or  book donations that didn't fit the library's needs. I had a collection of hundreds of books by the end of the next year. I dreamt about what I read, talked about the  ideas  with  anyone  who  would  listen,  and  found  my  mind  to  be  a  far more interesting place.

In fact, I attribute reading to giving me a more accessible and spacious internal life. Before I read frequently, I vividly remember the frustration of trying to grapple with big ideas, but I could not see them or make sense of them. I did not have the stories or vocabulary to help me understand these ideas and how they related to one another. I felt like a professional musician who was tone deaf and could not read music. I had the passion but I did not have the skill to turn that passion into something beautiful. Yet, as I read more books, I began to build a collection of stories, words, concepts, and mental tools that allowed me to think more deeply and with more clarity about those haunting ideas of old, not to mention countless new ideas. Even to this day, I value processing my thoughts through talking and writing, but I  believe  that  reading  widely  also  expanded  my  capacity  to  ponder  ideas and life; and I am incredibly grateful for that gift.

As such, it was not just about the knowledge gained through the books. Just as transformational was the fact that I was managing and directing my own learning. I was going to the library and picking out books of interest. This was not something coming for a course assignment, parent direction, or  a  teacher's  request.  I  came  across  something  that  intrigued  me,  and  I pursued it. I asked questions and then sought out books that might aid me in deepening my understanding of the question, and maybe even discovering some answers.  I  consider  this  the  beginning  of  my  life  as  a  self-directed learner. In the past, I thought of schooling and learning as synonymous, but no longer. I began to see learning as this wonderfully self-directed endeavor that can happen in and out of school. It was not something that I did for a test or grade. I did it because my curiosity compelled me. Learning became something  that  I  did,  not  something  done  to  me  by  a  teacher.  Of  course, many teachers played the role of mentor and knowledgeable resource, and helpful  guide;  but  the  teacher  was  no  longer  an  essential  ingredient  of  a learning  experience.  As  I  am  known  to  say  and  write,  the  only  essential ingredients in a learning experience are learning and an experience. Other ingredients add flavor, and they may well be important in many situations. Nonetheless,  as  one  grows  as  a  confident  and  competent  self-directed learner,  there  is  a  sober  discovery  that  the  role  of  teacher  is  valuable  but increasingly less necessary over time.

I contend that most great teachers embrace this reality. The goal is not to educate  people  who  are  perpetually  dependent  upon  the  teacher  to  learn. The goal is to equip learners who are increasingly independent, eventually capable of directing their own learning.

To be fair and honest, most who recall me as a student will tell you that I was  always  curious.  Remember  that  kid  in  the  room  who  used  to  ask constant questions? Remember how he got on your nerves at times because he  didn't  always  recognize  his  boundaries?  Remember  wishing  that  he would just be quiet so you could listen and take the notes that you needed for the test? I was that annoying, question-filled student.

The difference of discovering self-selected and self-directed reading was that  I  discovered  a  new  outlet  for  this  curiosity.  It  led  to  countless  other avenues for learning in the future, but this also helped me gain some selfcontrol in the classroom. Even today, I still ask plenty of questions, but now the classroom is just one of a growing number of ways to ask questions and discover answers.

I  believe  that  this  is  possible  for  any  learner.  There  will  be  different levels  of  curiosity  from  one  student  to  another.  Some  will  embrace  selfdirection more fully and more quickly than others. Yet, in our increasingly connected age, I believe that this is a mindset and skillset that will enhance the life and learning of all students.

## The Second Experience

Remember that college library job that I just mentioned in the last section? That led to a second self-directed learning epiphany. That library became a home  base  for  my  next  discovery  as  a  self-directed  learner.  I  went  to  a wonderful liberal arts college in Wisconsin where I took classes from full- time, often brilliant, and almost always present professors. I did not have a single class taught by a graduate assistant, for example; and it was the rare exception  for  me  to  have  a  part-time  instructor.  These  full-time  faculty welcomed students during office hours, including visits from students who were not enrolled in their classes, and I took full advantage of that. Some even invited me over to their houses for dinner.

On any given week, I visited three or four different professors, not to ask for help on a specific assignment or in preparation for a test. I wanted to learn from them. I wanted their advice on ideas that haunted me (in a good way) as a result of my newly developed reading habit. While my frequent visits started to exhaust some faculty, they were gracious and I learned as much from these visits as I did in any class. In fact, that was an epiphany for me, and I decided to formalize my learning outside of class.

At some point in college, I decided that it was time for me to take even greater ownership for my learning. I tried to do a decent job in my classes, writing papers and preparing for exams; but that was not enough for me. I decided to start giving myself writing assignments. I picked a question of interest, scanned the books and resources in the library, and starting writing weekly to bi-weekly research papers for myself. When finished, I placed the new paper in a folder for future use. Over time, I gathered a large enough collection of papers and notes that, when I started a new course and read the syllabus,  it  was  not  uncommon  for  me  to  have  a  ready-made  paper  to submit  a  formal  assignment.  It  did  not  always  work  out  that  easily,  and some have since claimed that this practice was unethical. I did not think of it  that  way.  I  saw  it  as  blending  the  formal  school  requirements  with  my personal curriculum and goals. I learned a great deal from these combined papers and projects, and even more about myself as a learner.

There  are  obvious  limitations  to  this  early  experiment.  I  did  not  get feedback  from  others  on  most  of  what  I  wrote,  only  the  papers  that  I eventually turned in for a class. That lack of feedback meant that the quality of my work only went so far. Nonetheless, this became an opportunity for me to cultivate a wonderfully intrinsic motivation for learning, and it served me  well  in  my  later  work,  in  my  aspirations  to  be  a  writer,  and  when  I arrived in graduate school.

In graduate school, where student voice and choice played a much larger role,  I  noticed  some  classmates  struggle  with  this  new  expectation  of autonomy. For me, it fit perfectly what the habits that I cultivated through more self-directed reading and writing. Even more important to me, this set me on the path to discovering some my life work and passions.

This idea of a college student giving himself assignments might sound rare  and  outrageous,  but  in  our  connected  age,  this  sort  of  thing  is increasingly common for learners. They might not go to a physical library and  write  papers,  but  they  are  feeding  their  curiosity  and  engaging  in learning outside of formal school. Some  are learning to code and connecting with others online. Others are nurturing their love of literature and  writing  through  fan  fiction  websites.  Others  spend  countless  hours watching inspirational but educational videos that explore everything from neuroscience to how to bake a cake.

The  readily  available  learning  resources  and  communities  on  the  web are a game changer for 21 st century learning. The strange aberration of me writing papers for myself is now present in countless young people who are going online to ask questions that are often less welcome in class. Some are taking advantage of this more than others, but that is part of this purpose of this  book.  I  contend  that  this  common  behavior  is  something  that  we  can nurture and celebrate in our schools, and that it will help schools achieve their  goals  while  also  further  empowering  learners  to  set  and  reach  their personal  goals  as  well.  The  blending  of  learning  in  the  classroom  and learning outside of the classroom is one of the more significant changes of our generation.

## The Third Experience

When I  was  only  a  few  months  out  of  college,  I  had  an  experience  that expanded  my  view  of  self-directed  learning  once  more.  I  was  reading  a book, Frames of Mind , by Howard Gardner. It is the book where Gardner introduced the concept of multiple intelligences to the broader world.  2  In fact, before reading that book, I found a draft of a paper that Gardner wrote on the idea of multiple intelligences. It included a message that it was in draft form and should not be cited in formal papers. Yet, the ideas in that paper  turned  into  a  book  that  put  forth  one  of  the  most  influential psychological theories in education of the last century. As I read it, I had a number of questions. This was in the 1990 s and I wished that I could talk to Howard Gardner, but I did not go to Harvard where he taught, I did not live  nearby,  and  I  did  not  know  him  personally.  Looking  over  at  my computer-it  was  actually  the  first  computer  that  I  bought  with  my  own money, I realized, 'I bet that I could find Howard Gardner online.' I got online and did not Google him; I think I AltaVisted him because that was my search engine of choice at the time. I found Harvard's website. I located his contact information. I reached out to him. I did not get a personal email from  Howard  Gardner,  but  I  did  get  a  reply  from  one  of  his  graduate assistants with the job of helping reply to his email inquiries. I also received answers to my questions within two days.

In a moment, a book became a two-way conversation with the author (or at  least  the  author's  graduate  assistant).  I  developed  this  sense  that  I  was connected  to  authors,  in  real-time  potentially,  and  that  became  a  lifetime journey for me. Now, when I am learning something new, I ask questions like the following: Who are the leading experts in the world, and how can I connect to them? Are there people doing interesting or promising work in this area with whom I could speak? How can I learn from them? How can I connect  with  them?  That  was  a  seismic  shift  in  my  learning,  and  it introduced me to this world of self-directed learning in a connected age that we are going to explore together in this book.

As  we  will  explore  further,  some  think  that  self-directed  learning  is some sort of solitary learning, and that is usually far from reality. Instead, it is a wonderfully connected and collaborative form of learning. It is just that the learners are setting at least some of the goals and co-designing some or all of the learning pathways. In fact, if someone fails to develop this ability to direct one's own learning by building connections, I worry that they will be at a disadvantage in this digital age.

## Self-Directed Learning Defined

It occurred to me recently that, while I have been writing and talking about self-directed learning for over a decade, this is not a familiar term to many in education or beyond. Or even if people have a general sense of the term, they  are  not  necessarily  informed  about  the  broader  conversation  and understanding of what different people mean by it. As such, allow me to take couple steps back and offer some working definitions for self-directed learning.

At  first  glance,  self-directed  learning  could  be  interpreted  as  solitary learning,  independent  learning,  teacher-less  learning,  and  a  dozen  other things. It can include any of those elements and more. It is a concept that has relevance when you are exploring learning outside of formal schooling, within  traditional  schools,  as  well  as  the  myriad  of  learning  communities online, in the workplace, in churches, and throughout our communities.

To help dispel myths and generate more productive thinking about the value of self-directed learning, I propose two working definitions for selfdirected  learning.  Both  are  by  thought  leaders  in  this  area.  The  first,  by Malcolm Knowles, is over 40 years old, and originally had adult learners in mind. The second has a history as well, but it is more current and includes a broader set of learners.

Knowles  defined  self-directed  learning  in  this  way:  'Broadly,  as  a process in which individuals take the initiative with or without the help of other[s], to diagnose their learning needs, formulate learning goals, identify resources for learning, select and  implement  learning  strategies, and evaluate learning outcomes.'  3

Knowles popularized this common definition for self-directed learning, and  his  definition  is  still  among  one  of  the  most  quoted  in  the  academic literature. He used it to focus on his primary area of interest, adult learning. Some used his writing and ideas for younger learners, but that was not the target  audience.  For  decades  (and  even  today),  people  argue  that  this concept  of  self-directed  learning  is  better  suited  for  the  adult  learner, arguing that younger learners are neither capable nor developmentally ready for doing what Knowles describes in this definition.

In more recent conversations about self-directed learning, some educators believe that this is an 'approach' to teaching that is better suited for gifted and talented learners. This gifted learning emphasis is not the case with Knowles. His definition is useful and important because his definition and  application  was  certainly  not  focused  upon  a  small,  Ã©lite  group  of minds. It is a concept applied to a broad set of adult learners ranging from formal  higher  education  to  continuing  education,  informal  learning  to continuing  and  community  education.  Anyone  is  capable  of  progressing toward greater levels of self-direction.

If we look at Knowles' definition as representing a spectrum, we can see that  an  environment  need  not  be  entirely  self-directed  or  absent  of  selfdirection.  It  is  possible  for  learners  and  teachers  to  partner  in  identifying learning needs, setting goals, planning the learning experiences and monitoring  progress  toward  learning.  In  one  circumstance,  the  teacher might  set  the  goals  and  plan  each  detail  of  the  learning  activities  and assessments. In another, the learners might have some input on one of those elements. In yet another context or at the 'right time,' the learner might be a true partner with the teacher and classmates in designing one or more of those elements. Finally, at a time and context of great learner independence, the learner might be in full or nearly full control, using the teacher simply as  a  guide  or  coach  on  occasion.  As  such,  we  can  benefit  from  thinking about degrees of self-directed learning and not just labeling something as self-directed or not.

This is an important point because there are proponents of self-directed learning who scoff at anything that resembles adult direction. They argue that it is not self-directed learning unless the teachers are absent, silent, or play at small of a role as reasonably possible. That is certainly one side of the spectrum for self-directed learning, but you do not need to agree with that  extreme  to  take  advantage  of  self-directed  learning.  There  are  more modest or moderate approaches that we can use to enhance learning in even the  most  traditional  and  teacher-directed  environments.  In  fact,  while  I believe that this book is valuable for people at any point on that spectrum, I am writing it with extra attention to those more moderate-minded people. I am  a  champion  for  moving  toward  as  much  learner  independence  as  is reasonable for a given context. At the same time, I also know that a teacher in a traditional classroom can take some of these ideas and apply them in ways  that  empower  learners,  enhance  the  overall  learner  experience,  and better prepare learners for the type of self-direction that will set them up for success in a connected world.

Advocates  of  self-directed learning argue  that at least creating a progression  toward  this  type  of  learner  independence  is  important.  It represents  a  collection  of  skills  that  are  valuable,  sometimes  critical,  for independence  and  a  high  degree  of  agency  in  the  rest  of  life.  Survey  a random group in society and you will likely discover that most people agree with this idea. Where we disagree is in considering the best pathway(s) to helping learners become independent and more self-directed.

A common myth related to defining self-directed  learning  is  that  it  is somehow inherently anti-teacher. In a sense, that is correct on one far side of the self-directed learning spectrum. Yet, for many, even most, that is a myth. In a chapter in The Sourcebook of Self-Directed Learning (edited by Rothwell and Sensenig), Hiemstra explains it this way when writing about self-directed  learning  in  training  environments.  'SDL  calls  for  trainers  to adopt new roles. SDL does not mean that trainers are superfluous and that trainees should learn everything in a sink-or-swim manner. Instead, in SDL, trainers  enact  such  important  roles  as:  facilitator,  enabling  agent,  and resource  agents.' 4 The  difference  is  where  we  place  the  power.  Selfdirected learning is about empowering the learners, equipping them to take control of their learning more and more as time passes.

Adding a stronger editorial comment, my greatest concern is not when formal education is heavily teacher-centered, but when  there is no intentional planning or vision for helping learners progress toward independence. This is a shortsighted and short-term approach to education. It  is  only  concerned  with  what  students  'need  to  learn'  about  a  given content area and not how to equip learners to grow as self-regulated, selfmotivated lifelong learners. Learning how to learn, experiencing the joy of learning, and developing effective habits as a learner are important enough to call for a national conversation.

This is important whether we are teaching elementary school children or doctoral students. As an example, consider the difference in quality between doctoral programs. Some  programs only accept highly self-directed learners. Others accept capable but dependent learners, but they do not help these  dependent  learners  progress  toward  the  independence  needed  to succeed on a thesis or dissertation (having a high non-completion rate). Still others  have  changed  doctoral  programs  to  make  them  more  step-by-step, helping people finish, but never really learning how to be a self-regulated and  independent  researcher  and  scholar.  They  graduate  with  a  terminal degree and are not that much more self-directed than when they started. If that happens on the highest levels of education, how much more do we face this  challenge  in  the  elementary,  secondary,  and  undergraduate  higher education levels?

A  second  definition  for  self-directed  learning  comes  from  Maurice Gibbons. His definition broadens the scope from adult learners to learners of  any  age.  'Self-directed  learning  is  any  increase  in  knowledge,  skill, accomplishment  or  personal  development  that  an  individual  selects  and brings about  by  his or her own  efforts, using any  method,  in  any circumstances, at any time.'  5

This  is  a  less  tactical  definition  than  what  we  see  with  Knowles' definition, but there are similarities. What they have in common is that selfdirected learning is about the learner building competence and confidence to become more than a passive recipient of learning. The learners are active agents,  even  directors  of  their  own  learning.  What  I  appreciate  about Gibbons'  definition  is  that  it  contrasts  self-directed  learning  with  other forms  of  learning  by  focusing  upon  one  key  component.  It  is  by  the learner's 'own efforts.' At the same time, the 'any circumstances, at any time' part of the definition allows us to recognize that self-directed learning is not limited to one context or setting, one type of school or program. The self-directed learner can make  use  of any method  or circumstance, including  traditional  teacher-directed  learning  environments.  It  is  not  the context  that  makes  it  self-directed  as  much  as  the  learner.  What  makes  it self-directed is that the learner 'selects and brings about . . . the increase in knowledge, accomplishment or personal development.'

I have never spoken directly with Gibbons about this, but his definition has  the  breadth  to  help  us  see  self-directed  learning  as  beginning  with learner agency. The learner is the agent, not just a recipient. In mandatory K-12 public school settings, this might be difficult to see. Yet, even in such mandatory  settings,  the  enlightened  learners  can  still  recognize  that  they have final say on what, if, how, and why they learn. They might choose to submit to the instructions and guidance of a teacher. They might not. They might  also  blend  some  of  their  own  goals  and  strategies  with  that  of  the teacher.  Some  learners  do  not  perceive  this  as  a  choice.  This  might  seem like splitting hairs, but learner choice  is always  present  in learning environments unless that environment is using extreme propaganda, manipulation, or brainwashing techniques. I like to think that such techniques are the rare  exception  in  education  today.  As  such,  what  I  am saying here almost certainly applies to the context of anyone who is reading this book.

Both of these definitions give us a helpful starting point for thinking and talking about self-directed learning. As with most terms in education, there is not uniform agreement or universal usage of a single definition. In fact, on more than one occasion, readers of my online articles about self-directed learner have called me out on my approach to the subject. In some cases, they did not think that I went far enough. In other cases, I they thought my ideas too extreme. Some saw my characterization as 'self-directed learning light.' Others saw it as verging on anarchy. There is plenty of room for all of us in this modern education ecosystem. Yet, these two definitions provide enough clarity for us to have fruitful conversations and to consider how we might nurture or at least leave room for the growth and development of selfdirection.

When  we  become  more  self-directed,  the  question  moves  from  the teacher to the student. With a teacher-directed class, it is the teacher who asks,  'What  do  I  want  or  need  the  students  to  learner?'  As  we  progress toward self-direction, there come times when there is room for students to ask, 'What do I need or want to learn?' A second question that a teacher might ask is, 'How will I know when the students have met the learning goal?' That leads teachers to create some kind of assignment, assessment or test  to  measure  student  learning.  They  need  some  means  of  measuring student progress and learning. From the more self-directed standpoint, we invite the students into helping answer that question. Students ask questions like the following. How will I know if I have learned and how will I show what I learned? How will I document it? How will I be able to demonstrate to  myself  and  to  others  that  I  met  this  goal  and  that  I  learned  something significant?  Learners  are  challenged  to  come  up  with  answers  to  these questions, at least to some extent.

Yet  another  question  in  a  teacher-centered  context  is  this.  How  will  I help the students get there? How will I teach them or help them learn? This is where teachers start thinking about the design of the lesson, the learning experience, or the learning pathway. As you might expect, we flip that as we progress  toward  self-direction.  Learners  start  to  ask  learning  pathway questions.  How  am  I  going  to  get  there?  How  am  I  going  to  learn  this? What do I need to do? What resources do I need? What strategies,  what practices,  what  experiences  do  I  need?  What  do  I  have  to  do  in  order  to reach this goal, to show and know that I learned this ?

It is inspiring to see learners take such ownership for helping to design the  pathways  to  their  learning  goals.  Yet,  for  most  learners,  this  does  not happen instantly. They must learn how to learn. They must discover what constitutes more and less effective learning pathways. As such, the learners start to develop expertise in goal setting, lesson designing, content curation, and building feedback or assessment plans for themselves. As anyone who trained  to  become  a  teacher  knows,  this  takes  time  and  practice;  but  it  is achievable to some degree for all learners.

I  will  add  one  final  question  that  is  part  of  this  mix  as  well.  Good teachers ask this. They ask the question, 'How am I going to make sure I know  how  students  are  doing  along  the  way?'  This  is  about  monitoring student progress, checking their understanding so that we can step in and help them if they are going astray or struggling too much. Or, if they are making progress, we might choose to share an encouraging word. Again, from the self-directed learning standpoint, this now becomes a question for the learners. 'How am I going to know how I am doing? How am I going to check my own progress and understanding?'

This last  question  is  critical  because  we  know  that  very  little  learning happens without feedback. Imagine trying to get good at hitting the target with a bow and arrow blindfolded. You are unable to see or hear whether you hit the target. You keep shooting arrow after arrow in what you think is the correct direction. Without feedback, how are you supposed to know how you are doing? How are you going to how when, if, and how to adjust what you are doing to improve your performance? Without some sort of feedback it  is  nearly  impossible  to  learn.  That  feedback  might  be  so  natural  and embedded  that  we  do  not  see  it  as  feedback,  but  there  need  to  be  some mechanism for guiding your practice and improvement. Since this is such a critical element of learning, imagine the power of equipping students with the  knowledge  and  skill  to  design  their  own  feedback  loops,  to  elicit feedback from various available sources. This is truly equipping people for lifelong learning .

## What is Self-Blended Learning?

At  times  in  this  book,  I  will  mention  yet  another  term,  self-blended learning.  This  is  really  just  a  creative  combination  of  two  terms,  blended learning and self-directed learning. I find that it helps some people and is confusing for others. If it helps you, great. If not, then do not worry about it. When you see the phrase self-blended learning, just replace it in your mind with self-directed learning, because the former is just a subset of the latter. Yet, I find this distinction a powerful one for those who are trying to take ideas  about  self-directed  learning  and  apply  them  to  a  more  traditional learning context, so I will at least introduce it at this point in the book.

The  real  shift  here  in  self-directed  learning  is  that  we  are  trying  to empower  and  encourage  the  learners  to  own  the  learning.  Self-blended learning is essentially blended learning (which I will define in the following pages)  plus  self-directed  learning.  Advocates  of  self-blended  learning  are especially  interested  in  ways  that  students  are  self-directing,  but  they  are doing  in  more  traditional  schooling  environments,  sometimes  even  apart from  the  teacher's  guidance.  Students  might  be  in  a  traditional,  teacherdirected  high  school  social  studies  class.  Yet,  for  one  of  many  possible reasons,  the  students  choose  to  expand  on  what  the  teacher  planned.  The students supplement or enhance their learning about social studies. It might come from curiosity about a topic  mentioned  in  the  class.  It  might  come from  the  students  wanting  more  feedback  and  guidance  than  is  currently available in the class. Whatever the case, the students use digital or other resources to enhance or expand the learning in some way.

Self-blended  learning  is  taking  self-directed  learning  that  I  already mentioned and combining it with the notion of blended learning. There are countless  definitions  for  blended  learning  but  at  its  foundation,  blending learning  is  about  combining  face-to-face  and  digital  learning,  something that is commonplace in most classrooms. There might be in-class activities combined with online digital content and resources. There could be online video  clips  blended  with  in-class  discussions.  There  are  settings  where students rotate through different stations at school, one station being student work at a computer on some sort of educational software followed by the next  station  where  the  student  gets  small  group  mentoring  and  guidance from a teacher.

There  are  countless  ways  for  this  to  take  place,  but  it  is  usually  the teacher  in  charge  of  the  blending.  The  teacher  is  selecting  and  curating online  content  and  resources.  The  teacher  is  choosing  the  software  and online  learning  experiences.  The  teacher  is  choosing  when  and  how  to blend  face-to-face  and  online  learning. Yet, the idea of self-blended learning, at least as I am using it here, is that the student begins to play a greater  role  in  finding  and  using  various  digital  resources  to  enhance  the otherwise teacher-directed learning experience. The student turns to Khan Academy  to  help  understand  a  concept  taught  in  class.  Another  student might be in a writing class, but she discovers an online group of aspiring teenage authors who meet online weekly to give each other encouragement and  feedback  on  one  another's  work.  Still  another  student  seeks  out additional  readings  and  experts  online  to  learn  more  about  the  subject introduced in class.

What is distinct about what I am describing is that the student is now the one  doing  much  of  the  blending,  not  just  the  teacher.  This  is  already happening  in classes around  the world. It does not require teacher intervention. In fact, teachers are sometimes completely unaware that it is taking  place.  Yet,  this  skill  of  learning  to  enhance  and  supplement  your learning is also a powerful skill for life in a connected world. The people who develop the confidence and competence to do this will gain a major advantage in the workplace and many other areas of life.

## Why Self-Directed Learning?

WITHOUT  A  COMPELLING  REASON,  why  would  anyone  go  through  the  hard work of encouraging and fostering self-directed learning in a school? This is not easy work. It takes time and energy, even emotional energy, to build a learning community where self-directed learning is valued and commonplace. As such, this is a chapter focused upon examining a few of the many reasons for embracing the challenge of this hard work.

## Student Voice

We need people who will stand up for what is right in the world. We need people who know how to learn and listen from others, but who also have the courage to stand up and be heard. How can a democratic nation survive if we do not have that? When people talk about school as a place to equip good  citizens,  we  sometimes  forget  that  this  is  not  just  about  fostering compliant rule-followers who also happen to vote. We also want people to know how to stand up, speak up, effect change, and be influencers in their communities, country, and world. We want people to have voices and use them, and school is a place where we can help students find that voice. It is just that we might need to reconsider how we go about a few things. Selfdirected learning is a great starting point .

What voices do students actually have in most learning organizations? What are our biases and assumptions about student voice? What happens when we move from education as something done to students to something that students do themselves? What amazing visions for education could we make a reality  if  we  tapped  into  the  perspectives  and  brilliance  of  young people in our K-12 and higher education institutions?

Ask a group of educators how to solve a problem and, more often than not,  we will suggest some sort of educational solution. We are wired that way.  Ask  a  sociologist  and  you  will  get  a  sociological  answer.  Ask  a psychologist and you get a psychological answer. Ask a theologian about a social  problem and there is a good chance that you will get a theological answer.  They  will  look  at  it  from  their  distinct  lens  and  provide  a sociological, psychological or theological assessment, drawing from solutions  most  common  in  their  fields.  What  does  this  mean  for  how  we aspire to find solutions to education's greatest challenges today?

Interestingly,  there  is  a  voice  that  is  often  muffled  in  education.  More often than not, these people are not involved in hiring decisions; exploration of new possibilities; plans for quality improvement; innovations in teaching, learning and curriculum; along with broader aspirations to address the  digital  divide,  access  and  opportunity,  workforce  development,  and more. We rarely involve the students.

In 1995 ,  Kathryn  Church  wrote  a  groundbreaking  book  about  mental health  called Forbidden  Narratives:  Critical  Autobiography  as  Social Science .  Unlike many other books about mental health, this text included the author's own lived experiences, finding herself in the curious position of being  both  a  mental  health  professional  and  a  mental  health  patient. Reading  this  lived  experience  of  a  researcher  and  patient  changed  the trajectory  of  my  work  and  research.  She  introduced  me  to  the  important world of auto-ethnography and autobiography as research.  6

This research method continues to be challenged by more than a few in the  social  sciences,  but  for  me,  it  opened  my  eyes  to  the  fact  that  much research fails  to  take  us  deeply  into  the  lived  experiences  of  people  from their own perspectives. Researchers, as much as we try, paint the picture of other  people's  lived  experiences,  but  we  hold  the  paintbrush.  Apart  from select excerpts that illustrate a theme or concept, the subjects do not have an opportunity  to  be  heard,  not  directly.  It  is  a  controlled  and  systematic reporting of the findings from the researcher's standpoint, but it does not necessarily  represent  the  nuance  and  voice  of  each  subject  in  the  study. Some researchers are better at this than others, but they rarely achieve what can be experienced when we hear directly from those subjects.

Applying this  lesson  from  Church's  work,  I  contend  that  we  have  the same  challenge  as  we  pursue  opportunities  and  innovations  in  education. We survey students. We might run focus groups. We observe and analyze student  motivation,  engagement,  persistence,  learning,  and  more.  We  are collecting  more  data  about  our  students  than  at  any  other  time  in  history. Far  less  often  do  we  invite  the  students  into  designing  the  schools, curriculum, and courses. How often do they help shape what, how, when or where  they  learn?  How  do  we  engage  them  in  prioritizing,  budgeting, establishing policy and practice?

Some argue that it is unwise to engage the learners in such important work, that it is best left to the expert educationists or academic professionals.  Yet,  look  at  higher  education  institutions  around  the  world and academics are making educational decisions when they often have little to  no  formal  training  in  the  field  of  education.  Policy  makers  are  making important  decisions  that  shape  the  future  of  education  when  many  have done  little  to  read,  research,  and  study  deeply  in  the  areas  that  they  are influencing.  Even  those  trained  in  education  are  consistently  making educational decisions based on their personal experience or preferences as much or more than their study of  the  research  or  by  tapping  into  a  solid body of evidence-based practice. Given these realities, why would it be out of  line to empower  students  to  own  not  only  their  learning  but  the communities in which they learn ?

The good news is that this is happening, even if in small ways. When I visited  Western  Sydney University, I saw this beautiful University library rich  with  collaborative  spaces,  study  spaces,  'silent'  spaces,  and  even  a sleep pod for those students needing a quick nap between a day of work and evening classes. When I asked about the design decisions, I learned that the students had an active say in much of it. In fact, there is a portion of the annual library budget controlled by the students. This allows them to pursue ongoing innovations, creating study spaces that align with their needs.

In classrooms and schools around the United States, school leaders and teachers invite  students  to  establish  and  shape  everything  from  classroom rules  to  what  and  how  they  will  learn.  This  is  especially  true  in  many schools  embracing  the  self-directed  learning  movement  making  its  way around the world. If you visit Acton Academy in Austin, Texas, you would learn that students establish many  of the rules. They  provide peer assessments.  They  work  together  to  keep  the  facilities  clean.  They  have ample say in what and how they learn. They even get to help create some of the  learning  experiences. When I visited Acton Academy in 2015 , I was impressed by the sense of agency and ownership displayed by each student.

Learning  about  the  original  formation  of  KM  Global,  a  project-based and personalized learning charter school in Wisconsin, Dr. Valerie Schmitz explained that much of the original vision for the school came from a team of students that she consulted. She gathered high school students to join her in developing the vision for the school that eventually turned into its initial charter. 7

How does a teacher or learning organization get serious about this? We will  explore that question in many ways throughout the rest of this book, but for those who are anxious to get started, here are some initial ideas to consider.

- 1. Create a team of students who help make decisions about the physical spaces in the learning organization.
- 2. Have  a  combined  team  of  students,  teachers, and  other related stakeholders  to  meet  four  or  more  times  a  year  to  plan  key  curricular innovations, including school-wide projects and timely elements of the curriculum.
- 3.  Involve  student  voice  in  the  interview  process  of  new  employees ranging from administrators and janitorial staff to teachers and coaches.
- 4. For secondary and higher education especially, have a student advisory committee for each department, division, college, or school.
- 5. Create a means of obtaining formal feedback from the students about the school culture, curriculum, and experience at least once a week.
- 6. Encourage teachers to establish small teams of students that work with the teacher to design, revise, and adjust lessons and units as the school year progresses.
- 7.  In  formal  and  intentional  ways,  invite  and  create  specific  ways  for students to become growing experts on teaching and learning research and practice.
- 8. When new projects, innovations, practices, models, and resources are being  considered;  have  teams  of  students  play  an  active  role  in  the research, review, and decision. In fact, why not have a means by which students can propose and initiate such things?

Student voice matters in education today. Listening to those voices and, even  more,  entrusting  students  with  decisions  about  the  nature  of  their learning  communities,  has  tremendous  benefits.  I  am  not  just  referring  to benefits in terms of test score results and measurable academic gains. What if  we  also  look  at  the  benefits  of  creating  more  equitable  and  humane learning communities for today? We see this happening in promising ways, but  what  if  we  saw  it  even  more?  What  if  we  found  ways  to  persistently engage  students  in  tackling  some  of  education's  greatest  challenges  and pursuing some of its greatest opportunities? What if the students had more room to imagine the possibilities and to pursue them ?

## Access &amp; Opportunity

An education can be a rich and rewarding experience. It is not, however, a magical  solution  to  access  &amp;  opportunity.  The  more  that  I  learn  about promising  possibilities  in  formal  K-12  and  higher  education,  the  more  I become convinced that an emphasis on curiosity, a love of learning, agency, and capacity for self-direction are among some of the best investments of our time and resources in education reform. This is because even the most elite  lecture  halls  are  not  the  solution  to  issues  of  educational  access  and opportunity.  I  offer  an  early  personal  college  experience  as  a  way  of illustrating this point.

My first year in college I had a 7 :30 AM American civilization class. The class met in a room a few hundred feet from my dormitory. Since the entire  University,  with  the  exception  of  one  building,  was  connected  by hallways, I did not have to go outside to get to class. I would set my alarm for 7 :25 AM, put on sandals, and wander into class a minute or two early.

Given  the  day  and  time,  this  class  was  where  I  experienced  my  first college exam. The entire class consisted of one paper, a midterm exam, and a final exam; so I had not received any feedback from the instructor before this  first  test.  I  never  even  had  a  one-on-one  conversation  with  him.  I completed  about  half  of  the  assigned  readings,  made  it  to  class  every session (albeit half asleep), took notes as best as I knew how at the time, and  that  was  about  it.  The  content  intrigued  me,  but  not  as  much  as  the important challenge of building new friendships and experiencing college community from 8 :00 PM to 2 :00 AM almost every night. I arrived on the morning  of  my  first  college  test  having  reviewed  my  notes  for  about  an hour,  assuming  that  was  adequate  for  the  task.  He  handed  out  something that he called a Blue Book, a 5 x7 empty collection of sixteen lined pages of paper. He wrote a few essay questions on the board and told us to begin.

I  did  not  know what to do. One of the questions on the board did not trigger any memories from the readings, lectures, or notes. A second related to a topic that piqued my interest in an earlier lecture, but my knowledge of the details was limited. The third was familiar from high school American history class where I wrote a research paper on the subject. I started with the familiar question and easily scribbled (if you ever saw my handwriting, you would commend me for such a precise word choice) four or five pages of  an  answer.  I  struggled  through  the  essay  for  the  second  question,  but there was only so much that I could do. It was not like I could work harder at recalling the necessary insights because they did not exist in my brain. I had an interested but shallow knowledge of the subject. Then there was the third question. I do not know what I wrote, but it was not good. As class came to an end, I set my Blue Book on the table in the front of class and headed to a late morning breakfast.

Skip ahead to 7 :30 AM, the next time that we met for class. I showed up,  listened  to  the  lecture,  took  notes,  and  then  he  returned  the  graded exams during the last five minutes of class. I opened my book and found a 'B-' marked at the top. I scanned the pages and counted a total of twenty words of comments, most of which consisted of phrases like 'more detail' or 'inaccurate.'

Two  months  later,  I  was  better  prepared  for  the  final  exam.  I  even showed up earlier than usual. As I waited for the test to start, I mumbled a few words to the person next to me, explaining how I studied but had no idea if I was ready for this test, alluding to the belief that the professor was largely to blame. I did not expect such a strong reaction from the classmate, a senior who must have switched majors along the way or somehow missed this introductory class earlier in his college career. He was a football player and I never talked to him before. I had seen him in a completely different state  on  Friday  nights  after  enjoying  the  party  scene  off  campus,  but  he seemed surprisingly  serious  at  the  moment.  He  was  not  pleased  with  my critique of the professor, leaned toward me, and retorted with three simple questions. Did you read? Did you study? How long did you study? There was no time for me to answer before the professor arrived and the exam started.

This  classmates's  reply  represented  a  belief  about  what  it  takes  to  be successful  in  college.  It  has  less  to  do  with  the  professor  and  almost everything to do with the student. Students who read, think, study, and work hard within the parameters set by the instructor earn the best grades. The professor lectures, creates tests and assignments, and grades the quality of your work.

Over the entire semester, I never had a one-on-one conversation with the professor.  Thinking  back,  this  might  have  set  the  groundwork  for  my growing  interest  in  self-directed  learning  in  a  connected  world.  In  some ways, it did not set the bar very high for independent learning. If I could find  quality  content  and  a  person  or  group  of  people  to  give  me  rich  and substantive feedback on my progress, I would have met or exceeded what I experienced in this first year American civilization class.

The first year of college consisted of the largest class sizes with the least amount of personal feedback and interaction with the professor. Later years involved ample small seminars, rich and rewarding one-on-one conversations  with  professors,  robust  peer  discussion  in  and  out  of  class, and  even  a  good  measure  of  formative  feedback  on  my  work.  Not  every class was like that, but many were.

It was  not  just  the  class  structure  that  changed.  It  was  me.  As  I progressed through college, I gained the confidence to seek out mentors. I read  and  studied  for  personal  interest,  not  just  for  a  class  assignment.  I volunteered at a public history museum to explore my passions and interests in anthropology. I sought out peers with shared interests, and our late-night conversations  far  exceeded  the  depth  that  we  reached  in  formal  class settings.  In  other  words,  my  education  took  off  when  I  relied  less  on  the instructor  and  more  on  my  growing  capacities  as  a  person  with  curiosity and a love of learning.

While there is much that learning organizations can do to create higher quality learning experiences, the single most important part of an education that  promotes  access  &amp;  opportunity  is  student  ownership.  If  K-12  and higher education institutions are going to equip people to thrive as learners and  throughout  life,  it  will  come  from  nurturing  people  who  are  not dependent upon a formal teacher-student construct. People with ownership who  can  self-regulate and  self-direct have  a huge  advantage  in  the connected world. Where traditional literacy was once a key to the treasures of  learning  and  opportunity,  self-direction  is  that  key  in  today.  Resources that  meet  or  far  exceed  what  I  experienced  in  a  first  year  American civilization  lecture  are  freely  available  to  those  who  can  find  and  take advantage of them. Empowering people to take advantage of such resources and  communities  is  one  of  our  best  chances  at  making  progress  toward access, opportunity, even workforce development.

## Beyond Students Meeting Standards

Some think about self-directed learning and wonder what place it can have in a world of increased academic standards. So much of school is becoming about  helping  students  meet  specific  sets  of  standards  in  given  areas.  We want  to  know  if  students  are  proficient  as  defined  by  whether  they  met certain standards. This is true for our youngest learners, and it is also true in many professional programs in higher education. We want our doctors and nurses to meet set standards before they start working on and with us.

There  is  unquestionably  a  role  for  standards  in  education.  We  want students who are literate and who have met standards that speak to what it means to be literate.  The  same  is  true  in  other  content  areas,  but  it  is  an even higher priority  when  we  look  at  certain  higher  education  degrees  in healthcare, or training programs for specific trades. Yet, meeting standards is not enough.

If  part  of  the  goal  of  education  is  to  liberate,  then  that  means  creating space  for  people  to  become  learners  who  are  capable  of  personal  growth and  development  regardless  of  whether  they  are  in  a  classroom  with  a teacher.  There  are  many  instances  where  one  needs  to  grow  and  develop with  regard  to  a  set  of  specific  standards.  I  prefer  going  to  a  healthcare professional who at least met a minimum set of standards in medical school. I seek out an electrician with a demonstrated ability to comply with existing codes.

Of  course,  meeting  the  standards  is  not  adequate.  One  of  the  reasons why I chose my current doctor is because she noted that she values staying current  in  the  emerging  research  in  medical  journals.  In  other  words,  her education did not stop at medical school. She takes the initiative to continue learning and growing despite the fact that medical school is decades behind her. Similarly, I do not want an electrician who does little more than comply with the code. I want one who can face new and unique situations in my hundred-year-old house and come up with creative and safe solutions that also  keep  projects  at  a  reasonable  cost.  The  standards  work  fine  as  a baseline, but it is not enough to be a person who earned the certification or met the standards. The one who stops at the standards or certifications is the one who remains largely other-directed.

Imagine a group of teachers who stopped reading, studying, and learning when they graduated from college. They only learn what they are 'forced' to do so through administratively mandated professional development days. Imagine if these teachers saw no reason to stay up on the amazing emerging research  about  the  brain  and  learning.  Imagine  if  they  did  not  have  an interest in taking the time to learn about the unique needs and interests of a new student in the class. What if they did not engage in the sort of reflective practice that allowed them to learn from their own teaching successes and failures? This group represents people who have not discovered the power and  possibility  of  self-directed  learning  in  helping  one  to  pursue  and sometimes  achieve  increasingly  greater  levels  of  excellence.  From  this perspective,  I  accept  the  role  of  standards  and  certifications  in  helping people  to  meet  baseline  skills  and  competencies,  but  we  are  unwise  to accept them as adequate for a liberal education that prepares people to be full and active participants in a democratic society.

At the same time, I am not suggesting the standards are necessarily the best starting point. When possible, there is great power in providing people with ample space to experiment, explore, question, and drive the learning apart from pre-determined standards. Amid this learning through discovery, the  people  will  sometimes  come  to  a  point  when  they  need  to  master  a certain  body  of  knowledge  to  meet  a  goal.  It  is  at  that  point  when  they embrace learning by standards in a new way, with a measure of purpose and intrinsic motivation.

Consider the example of learning to play baseball. To play on a team, I need to learn the rules of the game, the non-negotiables. I cannot just run to bases in random order because I feel like it, all in the name of self-direction. And yet, what should I learn first? Do we sit children down and quiz them on all the rules before they get a chance to experience parts of the game? Or, do we go to games with the kids, let them experience it, play catch with them, and give them a chance to swing at a few balls? Yes, a time will come when  they  will  need  to  meet  the  minimum  'standards'  for  playing  the game, but that does not always need to drive the learning. There are many instances  where  first  letting  them  explore  and  discover  on  their  own  has great  benefits.  Most  importantly,  it  is  a  great  way  to  tap  into  personal curiosity and interest, which is an incredibly powerful lever for learning.

There  are  exceptions  to  this,  like  teaching  certain  fundamental  safety rules before letting someone play with a dangerous object. Even then, when time and safety considerations allow for it, leaving room for self-directed learning not only helps learners meet immediate goals, but it helps them to develop  the  skills  and  character  necessary  to  learn  future  things  on  their own. Emerging brain research seems to support this. If we want people to engage in deep learning, then it is important to move from teacher-directed to student-directed experiences.

When asked what the recent brain research is telling us about how to teach,  Dr.  Matthew  Peterson  of  the  MIND  Research  Institute  replied  this way. 'Stop telling them things. Have them do things, problem solve, build things, discover how things work (and don't tell them how things work).'  8 These sorts of challenges provide qualitatively different learning experiences and, over time, result in qualitatively different types of learners and people.

Simply teaching to the point of meeting set standards also has the added downside of failing to equip students who are at the greatest disadvantage. If schools focus upon only teaching to the standards, then the deep and selfdirected  learning  will  happen  outside  of  the  classroom,  potentially  more often  for  the  students  who  live  in  environments  rich  with  tools,  safety, encouragement,  and  resources  that  help  promote  independence  and  selfdirection. Without necessarily intending to do so, we have one population of students who stop at literate, while another continues on toward greater levels of fluency in a myriad of domains and skills that will help them take advantage  of  opportunities  that  remain  largely  unavailable  to  the  simply literate. Self-directed  learning  is  partly  about  helping  people  progress throughout life toward fluency, deep learning, over-learning, and the type of immersive learning that leads to deep joy, satisfactions, and excellence.

I  am  not  pitting  standards  against  self-directed  learning.  I  am  simply making the point that standards are usually inadequate for helping to meet the central aims of education in a democratic society. We want an education beyond standards, and a self-directed learning mindset can assist with that.

## Self-Directed Learning Reality Check

You already know that I am an advocate for self-directed learning. There is no question about that. I wrote this book about it, I write about it often in other  places,  and  I  affirm  its  benefits  so  much  that  it  has  led  to  valid critiques that I am biting the formal education hand that feeds me. This does not mean, however, that I disregard the limitations of self-directed learning, and there are genuine potential limitations. Even as I dedicate this chapter to the reasons for self-directed learning, in a spirit of candor, I will conclude the chapter with a few limitations or reality checks.

Self-Directed Learning Reality Check 1 : Opportunity

Formal credentials and degrees still open doors for people. This is true in some fields more than others. There are plenty of fields and positions where alternative  pathways  to  demonstrating  excellence  are  adequate  for  getting an interview and the job. Yet, I have witnessed dozens of situations where otherwise qualified people did not get an interview, an invitation to apply, or  the  job  because  they  lacked  the  minimum  degree  qualifications  on  the job  posting.  Some  people  are  willing  to  make  exceptions  but  there  are plenty of companies where people are just working at a pace and with such a  volume  that  they  rarely  take  the  time  to  look  for  alternative  evidence. Some  companies  only accept applicants with degrees from specific institutions. Fair or not, this is a reality. The degree is shorthand to some for being  potentially  qualified.  It  is  an  easy  way  for  an  initial  screening.  As such, there are ample  situations  today  where  not  having  the  degree decreases your chances or sometimes restricts you from having any chance at a given job or a promotion.

As such, when write about the promise of self-directed learning, I am not arguing for it in lieu of a traditional k-12 and higher education. I offer this  as  what  I  consider  an  important  supplement  and  enhancement  to  that education. There are many examples of self-directed learners who thrived without the formal education, and I suspect that these alternative pathways will become more commonplace in the future. Yet, we are not there, and we may never get there in some areas of study. As such, I am arguing here for a both/and approach. I see great promise in looking for ways to infuse more of this self-directed mindset and skillset into otherwise traditional learning contexts.

## Self-Directed Learning Reality Check 2 : Gaps

Sometimes  the  self-directed  learning  pathway  leaves  gaping  holes  in  an education. A well-designed, systematic program is intended to fill most of those gaps. We can debate how well some programs do this, but certain jobs or professions call for more precision, and gaps are highly problematic. A surgeon  needs  to  have  a  core  set  of  skills  and  we  probably  do  not  want surgeons who have too many gaps in those core skills. This is true in other less life-or-death jobs and fields of study as well .

Of course, self-directed learners can embrace formal study and carefully constructed learning pathways that reduce gaps in learning, but not always. This is sometimes a limitation of the self-directed learning approach. Some people can learn to play an instrument independent of a teacher, but most benefit from an expert guide.

## Self-Directed Learning Reality Check 3 : Followership

I am quick to talk and write about developing leadership skills, but I cannot disregard the importance of learning to be a world-class follower too. Not all of us will be our own boss throughout life. Most people will hold jobs and positions where they report to others. Even when you are a CEO, you might  report  to  a  board.  As  such,  it  is  important  to  learn  to  follow  with excellence.

I am not sure that being a student in school is the absolute best training ground  for  followership.  Yet,  it  can  be  a  place  to  learn  some  of  the associated  skills  of  great  followers,  and  this  can  be  an  important  journey toward great leadership. There is no question that you can learn important skills of followership through a more self-directed learning experience, but I  want  to  recognize  that  some  of  the  scripted  or  directed  aspects  of  a schooling experience (even in more self-directed schools) can be opportunities  to  learn  these  skills.  The  model  that  dominated  much  of American schooling for the decades does help many people learn how to follow.

Of  course,  learning  followership  and  becoming  a  self-directed  learner are not mutually exclusive. Learning to follow is just another learning tool for the self-directed learner. For example, when I set a goal to learn Kung Fu, I am probably not going to make as much progress if I just try to do it on my own. Part of my plan as a self-directed learner will be to find a great teacher to help me. In this way, we find that mature self-directed learners are not people who insist on doing their own way all of the time. They are just  the  ones  who  set  the  goals  and  explore  the  best  ways  to  achieve  the goals. Sometimes the answer is tapping into more teacher-directed environments.  Yet,  what  is  distinct  is  that  the  overall  voice  and  choice remains with the learner.

## Conclusion-The Boy Who Wanted to be a Mortician

While there are plenty of limitations and cautions for us to consider, selfdirected  learning  plays  an  important  role  in  equipping  people  to  thrive  as lifelong learners. It is a way to nurture voice. It is an opportunity to help people learn to take greater ownership. It can help address issues of access and opportunity. It can empower. It can tap into personal curiosity. It can better  prepare  people  to  achieve  personally  meaningful  goals  throughout life.  It  can  also  help  people  expand  their  sense  of  what  is  possible.  To illustrate  that  last  point,  I  will  conclude  this  chapter  with  a  story  that  I originally published online. 9

When I was an undergraduate student, some others and I started an afterschool tutoring program for a small group of kids in Milwaukee. It was not anything elaborate. We showed up. The kids showed up. The kids did their homework and we helped them. We ate some snacks and got a chance to get know one another.

The first young person that I worked with was a middle school boy. We mostly  worked  on  math.  He  was  clever,  quiet,  kind,  and  persistent. Sometimes he just needed a little extra help. For the sake of the story, I will call him Marcus.

Marcus lived with his grandmother. I never found out what happened to his parents, but I did not pry. He seemed happy living with his grandmother. He knew that she loved him and while he did not like how strict she was, he seemed to understand it. For example, the neighborhood where he lived had significant crime and drug issues, and his grandmother refused to let him play in the neighborhood. So, for Marcus, his daily schedule consisted of waking up, eating breakfast, taking the bus to school, spending the day at school, taking the bus to this tutoring program after school, getting the ride home from there, spending time in the house at night, and then starting over again the next morning. Then the big event on the weekend was spending a half day at a local Pentecostal church.

One  day  at  tutoring,  some  of  us  were  having  our  snacks  and  talking about goals. Curious, I asked Marcus what sort of goals he set for himself. Not  that  he  needed  to  have  everything  figured  out  at  that  moment,  but  I asked  if  he  had  certain  careers  that  seemed  interesting  to  him.  Marcus looked up, smiled, and proudly explained that he wanted to be a mortician. I'd  never  met  a  young  man  who  said  that  his  dream  job  was  to  be  a mortician. This is nothing against that career. It is not typically at the top of the list for young people's potential future careers.

I do not remember how I asked it, but I inquired why. I thought perhaps he  had  a  family  member  who  was  in  that  line  of  work,  so  he  became familiar with it. Yet, when I asked if he had any family members or friend's family members who were morticians, he said that he did not. 'Then how did you decided upon that job?' I did not know how to react to his reply. 'I just  thought  it  would  be  a  good  job,'  he  explained,  'because,  in  my neighborhood, I know that I'll always have work.'

I wondered how many funerals Marcus attended in his life. I wondered how many friends or neighbors died. I pictured Marcus sitting in the corner of a funeral home, watching, listening, and thinking. As he saw everything happening, the tears, the grieving, the consoling, he noticed a man in a suit standing by the door, overseeing the event. The man greeted and directed people.  He  seemed  unusually  comfortable  in  this  environment.  When  the event ended and Marcus left with family, he saw this man closing the casket and beginning to put things away for the night. Marcus respected this man. He was dressed well, spoke well, moved with confidence, was comfortable even when others were not, and he seemed to take pride in his role. I do not know if any of this ever happened, but it was the image that came to mind as I listened to Marcus.

So often I champion the value of getting informed about the possibilities.  I  write  this  for  teachers,  school  leaders,  policymakers  and other related people; but how much more important is this for the students as well? Part of a great education is exposure and getting informed about the possibilities. This is the power of reading widely and deeply, immersive field trips, study abroad, internships, experiential education, and even just having guest speakers and visiting experts (resident artists, resident scientists,  resident  poets  and  writers,  etc.).  Students  experience,  discuss, observe, and learn.

As they are exposed to the breadth of possibilities, students also have opportunity to consider what path they might take in life. They don't need to have it all figured out at an early age, but there is a richness to learning about  and  appreciating  the  many  ways  in  which  people  use  their  gifts, interests, and abilities to benefit themselves and others. I believe that adding more opportunities for self-directed learning can create a forum for students to explore possibilities that interest them. When  done  in  a  diverse community of learners, each student will also learn from the perspectives and experiences of others.

Maybe Marcus is a mortician today. Maybe he is an amazing mortician who  does  his  job  with  excellence  and  has  the  honor  of  being  with  and assisting  people  at  some  of  their  most  sorrowful  and  more  challenging moments in life. Perhaps he wears a suit, is comfortable where others are not, and helps to create meaningful and memorable moments where people gather to grieve, remember, encourage, and begin the process of healing and closure. Maybe Marcus went another direction. I lost touch over the years. However, when I think about him, even today, I find myself wanting to find ways to help students experience the joy and freedom of getting informed about the possibilities.  This  is  probably  part  of  why  I  write  and  speak  so strongly about pathways over gateways, about access and opportunity, and about self-education. To some degree, Marcus is why I wrote this book.

## School as Resource for 'Real Learning'

SELF-DIRECTED  LEARNING  IS  A  critical  21  st-century  skill.  It  is  a  form  of literacy, the  ability to learn. Alvin  Tofler  wrote  about  this  when  he explained  that  the  literate  of  the  future  will  be  those  capable  of  learning, unlearning,  and  relearning. 10 Think  about  the  many  aspects  of  life  in  a connected  world:  access  to  information,  learning  tools  and  technologies, learning  to  connect  and  communicate  with  people  in  new  ways,  and learning  to  find  and  make  use  of  resources  across  platforms  and  media. Imagine  the  disadvantage  of  not  knowing  how  to  do  such  things  in  our modern world.

The  digital  world  created  massive  opportunities  for  what  some  of  us refer to as democratized learning. In the past, formal learning organizations controlled much of the knowledge, and acquiring that knowledge required you  to  go  to  the  experts  in  that  organization  to  obtain  it.  With  the development  of  mass  produced  books,  democratization  of  knowledge spread. People with the money to buy books obtained access to knowledge apart from school. Not all people had access to these books, however. When public  libraries  gained  traction,  even  people  from  the  poorest  families gained  the  means  to  check  out  and  learn  from  books  across  a  myriad  of topics,  again  all  apart  from  a  formal  school  or  a  teacher.  Next  came  the Internet  revolution,  drastically  expanding  the  scope  of  resources  available to  anyone.  Today,  if  you  have  Internet  access,  you  are  a  few  clicks  from books,  articles,  videos,  mentors,  communities,  free  courses,  and  so  much more.

Yet,  not  everyone  benefits  from  these  equally.  It  is  the  self-directed learner who garners the greatest benefit, as we will discuss in greater depth when  we  get  to  the  chapter  on  the  new  digital  divide.  The  why  of  selfdirected learning is rooted in equipping people to get the most out of this new and connected world. This has implications for many domains of life and  work,  but  as  an  example,  allow  me  to  draw  your  attention  to  the workplace.

Interview leaders in companies and other organizations. Ask them what sort of skills are necessary for people to thrive and move toward growing leadership in an organization. You will get many answers, but if you find results similar to what I discovered, you will see that it takes people who are committed, people who take ownership in their work. They do not just wait for others to tell them what to do. They are not just clocking in their hours. They take initiative. They take pride in their successes and they own up  to  their  failures.  They  are  constantly  learning  and  monitoring  their learning, trying to get better at what they do.

Does any of this sound familiar? These are the traits of a self-directed learner.  When we equip people to develop agency and ownership in their learning, we are also preparing them for agency and ownership in work and other  areas  of  life.  We  are  equipping  them  with  incredible  skills  and attitudes that are highly sought  after in the workplace.  As  such,  a compelling why behind teaching and nurturing self-directed learners is that this  is  a  great  way  to  set  people  up  for  a  lifetime  of  success  in  the workplace.

Of course, there are exceptions. There are some jobs that want people to be  compliant,  unquestioning  about  following  the  rules  and  procedures  set by  someone  else.  Push  this  button.  Say  exactly  these  phrases.  Use  these steps  only.  Then  do  it  all  over  again.  Yet,  these  are  not  usually  jobs  with security or opportunity for advancement. The jobs that give greater stability are  often  the  ones  that  call  upon  people  to  think  for  themselves  and  get work done independent of constant monitoring and redirection .

As I suggested in the previous chapter, a key to access and opportunity is empowering people with a sense of agency and self-confidence. That is why this matters so much. This is why this is a critical social issue that we can tackle if we begin to empower, encourage, and create space for people to self-direct. In some ways, this is putting digital teeth on the adage: 'Give the man a fish and he will have fish for a day; teach a man to fish, and he'll have fish for a lifetime.' This is even more important because the fishing is truly amazing in this connected world!

The critic says that this is fine if you are an autodidact. If you are an exceptional and gifted learner, this is a wonderful concept, but it does not work for your average student. I beg to differ. In fact, I know with certainty that  this  works  with  a  variety  of  students  because  I  have  seen  it.  This  is something that is actually happening in our schools, whether we know it, like it, see it, or not. There are self-directed learners all around us.

Some people say something like this. Self-directed learning is great for these students, but not for those students  I suspect that there are sometimes . undertones  of  flawed  stereotypes  in  such  statements.  Too  often  there  are beliefs  that  self-directed  learning  is  for  certain  populations  and  not  other populations.  I  am  concerned  about  this,  and  I  think  we  need  to  tackle  it head-on because it is false. Self-directed learning and self-blended learning are visible across socioeconomic lines, across the different types of people that we have in our world and in our learning communities. We see people of  all  types  who  are  capable  of  doing  this.  Some  people  might  have backgrounds and experiences that discourage them from embracing a life of self-directed  learning.  Maybe  they  had  people  in  their  community,  their family, or their schools that did not encourage them. That is a possibility, but that is not destiny. Those are not genetic predispositions away from selfdirected learning. Anyone can become more self-directed over time.

I appreciate the skepticism when I mention people like Tesla, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Edison, and Abraham Lincoln. We are not all going be a Mozart, Tesla or a Leonardo da Vinci. Yet, by learning and embracing the concepts  of  self-directed,  we  can  progress  toward  our  individual  and distinct callings in life. Perhaps you started at a different place than another person in terms of your giftedness for music, art, science, or something else. Maybe it is true that you will never become the next Mozart. That does not matter. Nurtured and encouraged to embrace self-directed learning, you can get much better than you are now, and that is part of the vision. The vision is  to  help  people  start  on  a  lifelong  journey  of  growing  competence  and confidence in multiple areas.

All of this is a precursor to the main concept in this chapter, the idea of school as a resource for learning. Many of us think of school and the formal school  curriculum  as  the  primary  and  most  important  part  of  a  person's formal  learning,  but  this  connected  age  challenges  some  of  that.  The democratization  of  learning  mentioned  earlier  in  the  chapter  means  that learners of all ages have more than one means of learning. Sugata Mitra's well-known hole-in-the-wall experiments illustrate my point. He conducted experiments where he put computers with Internet access in walls of towns in  India  to  see  what  would  happen.  From  this,  he  and  his  colleagues describe  what  he  calls  self-organized  learning  environments.  Without  the presence  of  a  teacher,  students  worked  together  to  create  meaning.  They developed new literacies simply through a computer with Internet access.  11

In such a world, schools can learn to see themselves less as keepers of knowledge  and  guardians  of  expertise.  Of  course,  they  will  be  places  of knowledge and acquiring expertise, but they are not keepers and guardians. They can choose new metaphors. They can see themselves as launch pads of learning with the hope and assumption that student learning will extend far beyond what teachers plan for students.

With  this  in  mind,  schools  can  benefit  from  looking  at  themselves  as resource centers. The school is one important aspect of a student's learning, even  a  central  hub,  but  not  the  only  source  of  learning.  Teachers  are  not distributors of content as much as they are guides, resources, coaches, and mentors .

Imagine a classroom where students arrive excited to study a topic of personal  interest.  Perhaps  they  do  this  self-directed  learning  half  of  the time.  Then  there  are  shared  learning  experiences  and  activities  the  other half  of  the  time.  Imagine  a  high  school  where  each  individual  or  small groups creates a new and driving question every quarter or semester. One student  chooses  to  explore  the  causes  of  racism  as  informed  by  a  deeply personal  recent  experience.  Another  student  might  want  to  learn  about sports injuries because of a torn ligament as a dancer.

The  students  work  with  the  teacher  to  set  goals,  devise  a  plan  for exploring  the  question,  and  to  select  a  culminating  project  or  artifact  to show what the student learned at the end of the semester. Each student will also need to present the work in a public exhibition open to the community. The dancer with the torn ligament will learn about sports medicine, human anatomy, and physical therapy. This student will also develop interviewing skills,  information  literacy  skills,  research  skills,  writing  communication skills,  time  management  skills,  and  the  student  will  develop  disciplinary literacy by working through challenging science-related texts. Beyond all of this, the student gets the experience of persisting with a project for weeks and months, something rarely done in many classrooms, but a critical skill for most leadership positions in the workplace.

The line of inquiry for each student is important, but it is also about all the learning, communication, and thinking skills developed along the way. In a learning environment like this, school is really becoming that resource for learning. The teachers are coaches and guides. The other classmates or co-learners and resources for learning as well.

This  is  what  is  happening  in  some  schools  with  promising  results.  Of course, not every school is interested in throwing out the entire curriculum, which is why we see many hybrid approaches. While schoolwide efforts are promising, a teacher in any class or content area can gradually incorporate small  elements  of  this  approach.  This  can  be  done  alongside  the  regular curriculum or as a more integrated and embedded part of the class. As such, there  is  something  in  this  book  for  people  across  the  spectrum  when  it comes  to  their  views  about  self-directed  learning.  For  the  person  who  is generally content with their school and classroom, you will find plenty of ideas that you can incorporate alongside everything else that you are doing. For the person who is discontent with the system and believes that we need to  rebuild  from  the  ground  up,  you  too  will  find  something  of  value.  Of course, there is something for everyone in between these two ends of the spectrum as well.

## The Learner with a Thousand Tutors and the Personal Learning Network

SELF-DIRECTED LEARNING IS NOT lone ranger learning. It is also not learning in isolation. Sometimes people think of it as anti-teacher, when it is actually the most pro-teacher position that you can take. When we start talking about self-directed  learning,  we  are  talking  about  the  learner  with  a  thousand teachers. Yet, that admittedly calls for us to redefine 'teacher' so that we are  able  to  fully  understand  the  possibilities.  Allow  me  to  suggest  this expanded,  albeit  a  bit  startling,  definition  of  a  teacher.  A  teacher  is  any experience, any person, any thing, or any group that can help you learn.

Imagine  for  a  moment  that  you  are  a  student  in  a  class  that  you  are excited about; it is an interesting topic. You come in, and you discover that the  teacher  is  not  interesting  or  engaging.  The  teacher  is  burned  out, checked out, physically present, but otherwise absent from the room. What do you do as a student? Or, maybe you are in a class, and there is a wellmeaning new teacher who is passionate about the topic but can only take you so far. You are deeply curious and have questions that go beyond the boundaries of the class and maybe that teacher's expertise. Or, perhaps you have  one  of  these  passions  or  interests  that  is  not  part  of  the  formal curriculum.  It  gets  mentioned  but  nothing  more.  Teachers  usually  have  a focus.  They  have  certain  material  that  they  want  or  need  to  cover  and certain objectives they need to focus upon. That is just how school works much of the time.

Yet, self-blended learners have access to a world of teachers and tutors. Everything around them is a teacher. Every person around them is a teacher. What does it mean to take advantage of these thousand tutors that you have available to you? Let me suggest suggest a couple of ideas

Conduct  an  inventory  of  your  own  life. Think  back  about  your childhood  up  to  the  modern  day.  Create  a  list  of  all  of  the  people  who helped you learn something. Do not limit it to the people with the formal title  of  teacher  or  professor.  Just  make  a  list  of  people  who  helped  you learn. If you want, you can stretch yourself to think about the other teachers in your life, not just people, but groups, experiences, formative books, and other resources that served as teachers and guides for you along the way. Commit to creating this list for ten to fifteen minutes. I encourage you to actually do this. Set this book aside and write out your list. Then we can continue.

You likely have an impressive list, the vast majority of whom are not formal teachers. You are well on your way to revealing the fact that you are already a learner with a thousand tutors. Why not make this a more central and recognized part of each student's formal learning as well? Why not help them recognize their list of tutors and grow that list? Why not help them tap into the people on that list to achieve their learning goals now and well into the  future?  This  is  not  only  an  asset  for  their  present  learning,  but  it  is helping  them  build  a  lifelong  network,  something  that  we  will  examine more broadly in an upcoming chapter.

Now try  this  exercise.  Think  about  something  that  you  love  to  learn, something for which you have a deep passion and interest. Now devote five to  ten  minutes  searching  the  web  for  people  and  resources  related  to  that topic. Create a list of interesting discoveries. If you could learn about these things from anyone or anything in the world, what would it be? Maybe you could do a search for the top ten most knowledgeable or skilled people in the world on the subject. Or, you could search for the best resources in the world.  Just  look  around  for  them,  and  build  this  list.  If  you  want  to  be courageous, try the third step. Reach out to some of those people. Tell them about your interests. Tell them about what you know and what you do not know. Share a few questions with them. Maybe ask if they would be willing to connect with you in a Google Hangout or some kind of live chat. Or you can ask if they are willing to interact with you via email. I think you will be surprised  to  find  what  happens.  There  are  many  people  who  love  being teachers.  The  thing  is,  people  who  have  become  experts  in  areas  usually want to share that expertise with others. They have a passion for it, and it is difficult for them to contain. They want to let it out, and they do. You can be a recipient of that.

## The Personal Learning Network

Now  we  can  expand  on  this  idea  by  looking  at  a  concept  that  is  likely familiar to many readers, the personal learning network. There are countless articles and several books on personal learning networks for students, but I am going to suggest that we expand this to think about students, building off  the  idea  of  a  learner  with  a  thousand  tutors.  As  I  help  teachers  in traditional schools explore ways to integrate self-directed learning into their otherwise conventional curriculum and classrooms, I consistently find that the  student  personal  learning  network  is  one  of  the  easiest  but  most impactful approaches.

Personal Learning Networks have been around for some time. The idea of a PLN is simply a network of people and resources through which you learn and grow. Books like Personal Learning Networks: Using the Power of  Connections  to  Transform  Education 12 and The  Connected  Educator: Learning and Leading in a Digital Age 13 both give a helpful introduction to this concept and what it means for educators .

However,  there  is  a  smaller  and  potentially  even  more  significant conversation  about  personal  learning  networks  that  is  taking  place.  That consists  of  a  growing  number  of  us  who  are  looking  at  the  idea  of  a personal learning network, combining it with the promise and possibility of self-directed  learning,  and  starting  to  think  more  about  how  we  might empower and encourage students to cultivate their own personal learning networks.

What  if  learning  communities  and  organizations  made  student  personal learning networks an integral part of the learning experience? As students progress through their schooling years, what if they cultivated a deeper and more substantive global personal learning network?

Informed  by  the  idea  of  connectivism,  a  student  personal  learning network is one that helps students not only learn about a given topic, but also  grow  in  their  understanding  of  how  to  cultivate  and  make  use  of knowledge  networks.  It  is  one  thing  to  study  world  geography  out  of  a textbook. It an entirely different experience to connect with people around the  world,  learning  from  each,  comparing  and  contrasting  geography  in different  parts  of  the  world,  and  building  meaningful  and  sometimes persistent connections with those people.

## A Little Learning Theory Background

If we examine some of the trends in education over the past century, we can see them as extensions of four learning theories: behaviorism, cognitivism, constructivism, and connectivism. Behaviorism is where we get things like measurable  learning  objectives  in  education.  This  is  the  body  of  work focused upon observable behavior, rewards, punishments, classical conditioning,  and  operant  conditioning.  Behaviorism  is  often  associated with names like Watson, Skinner, and Thorndike.

The influence of behaviorism in education can be traced to the early part of the 20 th century, but it continues to inform thought and practice today. 14 It informed the work of many scholars and educators over the last century, and it can also be seen as a significant influence in the push toward the use of  observable  and  measurable  learning  objectives.  Teachers  in  the  1960  s and 1970 s were introduced to this idea through books like Robert Mager's Preparing  Instructional  Objectives 15 , but  by  the  1980  s  use  of  such objectives became common practice in schools around the United States. If you cannot see it, measure it, or document it, then it loses significance from a behaviorist's perspective.

Alongside  the  influence  of  behaviorism  we  saw  the  development  of cognitivism.  One  of  the  more  well-known  educational  influences  of  this movement  relates  to  the  idea  of  developmental  psychology,  when  we discovered that the brain develops in certain stages and we can start to plan learning experiences based upon where people are in these developmental stages.  Where  behaviorism  focused  upon  external  observable  behavior, cognitivism invited attention to the inner workings of brain.

Constructivism  emerged  amid  these  two  perspectives  on  learning, adding yet another strand to the conversation. As the name might suggest, constructivism focused upon  the idea that knowledge  is  not simply something that one person transfers to another, but knowledge is constructed within an individual through experience. For many educators, John Dewey is likely the first name that comes to mind when thinking about such  ideas.  You  may  also  think  of  people  like  Vygotsky,  Kolb,  and Montessori.

While I represent these three learning theories as if they came in a nice and  neat  chronology,  the  reality  is  that  they  often  crossed  paths  with another. We see ample evidence of them intermingling, especially when we look at educational models and practices over the last century. Today it is common to find educators who describe their educational philosophy and practice  in  a  way  that  seems  to  relate  to  all  three  of  these  in  one  way  or another.

More  recently,  even  into  the  21  st century, we  find  yet  another perspective added to the conversation. George Siemens introduced connectivism,  which  seems  to  suggest  that  knowledge  is  not  simply something  that  exists  in  our  brains. 16 Instead,  knowledge  exists  in  our connections with other people, resources and communities. This resonates with the experience of many in this digital and information age, as we often find  that  our  connections  with  others  is  what  enables  us  to  work  and flourish. Medical professionals rely upon complex data systems and other professionals  for  certain  tasks.  Even  historians,  sometimes  thought  of  as solitary scholars, now share rich data sets on the web and collaborate with one another to carry out research goals and tasks.  17

## Self-directed Learning Revisited

Now we can turn our attention back to the topic of self-directed learning for a  moment.  As  I  look  at  learning  organizations  today,  I  see  two  major approaches  to  teaching  and  learning.  I  will  use  a  fishing  analogy  that  I alluded to earlier in the text for this example. Some schools are set up as fish distribution centers. They are like fish markets where a person is given a  fish  and  can  then  prepare  it  and  eat  it.  Other  learning  organizations function more like places of fishing lessons. They do not just give out the fish.  They  teach  the  people  how  to  fish  for  themselves.  The  first  is  the school that seems content with distribution as the goal, leaving the learners dependent  upon  a  teacher  to  grow  and  learn.  The  second  focuses  upon equipping learners with the ability to learn for themselves, allowing them to develop  the  skills  necessary  to  thrive  as  learners  for  life.  From  this perspective, the goal of a learning organization is to help students progress toward independence.

In reality,  few learning organization are one or the other of these two. They are most often at some point in a spectrum between the two. Some focus  upon  content  distribution  with  some  opportunity  for  self-directed learning,  while  others  are  heavy  on  self-directed  learning  with  occasional content  distribution.  An  easy  way  to  think  about  this  is  to  consider  the spectrum of  a  school  based  upon  four  questions  that  we  examined  in  the first chapters of this book. On the one side we have a more teacher-directed approach. On the right side, we have a more self-directed approach. Usually we find schools that vary on the spectrum for the four questions. Whatever the  case,  my  argument is that our goal is for all learners to eventually be empowered and able to function on the far right side of this chart.

This finally brings us back to idea of a student personal learning network, which  is  a  mix  of  connectivism  and  self-directed  learning.  As  defined  at Wikipedia, 'A personal learning network is an informal learning network that consists of people a learner interacts with and derives knowledge from . . . ' 18 When I ask people to describe their personal learning network, they sometimes start by listing the technologies that they use, tools like Twitter, blogs, YouTube, and various communication tools. That is understandable because these are the tools that allow them to connect with their network. However, I argue that the network is largely the people, communities and resources; not the technologies themselves. If I showed you a picture of a large public swimming pool full of people and asked you to describe what you saw, you would likely not describe the technology of a swimming pool. You would instead talk about the people, what they were doing, and how they are behaving. Similarly, a personal learning network is first about our relationships and connections with people and resources, hence the idea of a learner with a thousand tutors. We use the tools to strengthen, lengthen, and make such connections .

## A Student Personal Learning Network

A student personal learning network is, therefore, a rich and ever-growing series of connections with people, resources, and communities around the world, connections that allow learners to grow in knowledge, skill, ability, and perspective. What if we spent more time thinking about the networks that  students are building as they go through their schooling years? What are the tools and technologies that they use and how are they using them? One  of  many  connections  in  this  network  will  likely  be  one  or  more teachers.  It  will  also  include  classmates,  family  members,  community members,  and  others  with  whom  they  learn  and  interact  in  the  physical world. As it expands over the years, it will also include people far beyond the walls of the home, school and community.

What if we made it part of the curriculum for students to build such a network, inviting students to keep a log or journal of their growing network, and how this network is empowering them to learn. How is it expanding their  knowledge  and  perspective?  How  are  they  building  a  meaningful network? This would genuinely turn schools into places of fishing lessons. Students can interview people around the world, tutor, and be tutored. They can  take  part  in  formal  and  informal  learning  communities.  They  can participate  in  Twitter  chats  and  Hangouts,  learn  from  and  engage  in  the blogosphere  the  world  of  podcasts.  They  can  experience  the  power  of working on a meaningful project in a distributed or virtual team. They can participate in a massive open online course (or design and teach one). They can  share  resources  through  social  bookmarking  and  other  technologies, host and take part in webinars, and build new online and blended learning communities around topics of personal value, need, and interest.

Over time, the students will not only build a personal learning network. They will also venture into starting their own personal teaching networks, being  agents  of  change  and  positive  influence  in  the  digital  world  and beyond.  This  is  a  learning  exercise  that  can  extend  across  courses  and grades. Of course, their network goes with them after they graduate as well .

## Practical First Steps

There are four simple steps to get started with this.

- 1. Introduce students to the idea of a personal learning network and have them  create  a  map  of  that  network  using  their  favorite  mind-mapping tool. If you have one, share your PLN as an example. Be sure to spend time on the 'why' of a PLN. Then invite students to add to and refine this network over the year.
- 2. Set  aside  time  for  PLN  show  and  tell.  This  is  a  time  where  students display the visual of their network to others, describing how they use it and how it helps them. On occasion, have students explain what is new in their network, how it was added, and how it helps them. This provides a wonderful opportunity for peer-to-peer learning.
- 3. Create simple challenges where learners find a problem, try to solve it, and periodically report back to the group. They will build and leverage their network to solve the problems. Along the way, they will not only find potential solutions, but they will experience the power of connected learning.
- 4.  If  you  are  working  with  younger  students,  consider  building  a  class PLN, where you map it out on the wall, and you collectively add to it throughout the year through Skype sessions, Google Hangouts and other connections with people and groups around the world. When you face a new challenge as a class, ask the students, 'Is there anything in our PLN

that could help us with this? Do we need to expend or expand our PLN in some way?'

## Networked Learning

In Informal Learning ,  Jay  Cross  describes  the  changing nature of human organizations,  business,  computers,  and  learning  in  the  21  st  century. Referencing the work of Tom Malone (MIT), Cross explains that networks consistently evolve in three stages. The first is disconnected nodes or what he  calls  bands.  Think  of  the  days  where  there  was  the  butcher  shop,  the blacksmith, the carpenter, the baker, and others in a single town. Each one represented a distinct and separate band. The second is a more hierarchical model which he calls kingdoms. Now think of a company that owns and operates  the  bakery,  mill,  butcher  shop,  and  the  other  entities  that  were previously  independent.  They  report  up  through  what  we  think  of  as  an organizational chart. The last is a largely organic and inter-connected set of nodes, which he calls democracy. There is no obvious leader, but they are connected with one another in many ways, collaborating as needed. Cross uses these to explain how human organizations go through these same three stages  as  they  move  to  a  networked  society.  It  is  the  same  for  business operations and even learning within an organization (the focus of Cross's book).  19

This  is  a  brilliant  illustration  because  I  can  overlay  it  on  a  dozen different communities and organizations with which I work, and it provides rich  insights  about  what  is  working,  what  is  not,  why  there  are  seeming conflicts, why things sometimes just 'click,' and why some of us just seem to  be  talking  right  past  each  other.  We  are  living  and  thinking  about different  stages.  A  typical  University,  for  example,  might  have  faculty functioning as independent nodes, administration function in the hierarchy, and students thinking and function more in that democratic stage. You can imagine how this can and does cause tension. This is a powerful tool for explaining the communication  breakdowns  and  conflicting values in learning communities.

Allow  me  to  illustrate  from  a  formal  schooling  setting.  In  the  K-12 world,  there  is  the  community,  the  school  board,  the  superintendent,  the principal,  department  chairs,  classroom  teachers,  and  students.  For  many, they are thinking of this from a stage two perspective. This is a hierarchy. Where do parents fit into the picture? They are part of the community, but I

wonder if this is not part of why I consistently see tensions about the role of parents. If parents stay out of the way or just play the role of helping their kids fit into the hierarchy, all is well (from some people's perspective). If, on the other hand, parents are communicating messages to kids that do not align  with  what  the  teachers  want,  or  the  parents  want  to  influence  what happens in the school, then there are problems.

Or, what if a student chooses to learn about things outside of school, by using  separate  tutors,  through  self-study,  or  something  else?  We  have another potential conflict. The teachers thinking from a stage two perspective may well see this as a challenge to their authority and rightful place in the hierarchy. All works well as long as the students do things the teacher's way, according to the teacher's timing and standard.

As Cross explains in his text, people in different stages have different ways of  thinking.  He  describes  the  traits  of  people  thinking  at  stage  two versus  stage  three  thinking.  Stage  three  thinking  is  organic,  seemingly chaotic at times, and participatory. People are multifaceted, the organization is  emergent,  cooperation  trumps  competition,  and  change  is  constant  and welcome.  For  a  stage  two  organization,  things  are  carefully  managed, linear, controlled, predictable, deliberately designed, competitive, and change is a concern.  20

The more I think about this comparison, the more I suspect that part of the  struggle  and  growing  pains  experienced by many people and learning organizations today comes from the fact that we have the clash of stage two and three thinking.

I  participate  in  many  online  communities  ranging  from  Twitter  chats  to private  professional  networks,  communities  of  practice  to  MOOCs.  I approach most of them from a stage three mindset. I recognize that there might be a formal leader, but I find myself frustrated when that leader seeks to  control  too  much.  I  have  seen  such  a  mindset  stifle  the  energy  and passion  of  many  online  groups.  These  hierarchical  thinking  leaders  are running it like a stage two community, and while I can appreciate lessons and  experiences  from  such  organizations,  I  thrive  on  the  messiness  and inter-connectivity of stage three contexts.

There are still authorities, leaders, and people with different degrees of influence  in  stage  three  communities,  but  some  still  function  from  the mindset  that  you  need  one  central  leader  or  coordinator  who  functions almost  like  a  puppet  master.  That  may  or  may  not  be  true  for  various communities  and  efforts,  but  the  presence  of  a  leader  does  not  need  to conflict  with  stage  three  thinking.  They  can  work  together.  It  just  takes  a leader with humility who does not need everything to be closely managed by a single person.

It  calls  for  a  leader  who  persistently  welcomes  people  to  step  up  and take things in unexpected  directions, to network  and  collaborate in wonderful ways.

Communication is another clash between stage two and three thinking. A stage two leader might scold learners for talking to too many different people, advising them to focus on their assigned tasks and not others. What might be happening, however, is that the one person is doing stage three thinking:  networking,  collaborating  across  teams,  exploring  topics  from different  angles,  seeing  a  broader  perspective  and  deeper  insights  that inform  their  work.  Trying  to  force  stage  three  thinkers  into  a  stage  two world is likely to frustrate, and it might cause organizations to lose some of their best talent.

On  the  flip  side,  there  are  stage  three  thinkers  who  are  crossing traditional  boundaries,  improvising,  and  diving  into  the  chaos;  but  they have missed a critical part of the stage three context. The nodes are interconnected.  In  a  stage  two  organization,  if  I  do  something  differently,  the communication  structure  is  more  carefully  controlled.  In  a  stage  three organization,  the  person  making  a  change  often  needs  to  communicate much more broadly, developing a nuanced understanding of all the different people impacted by a decision. This is where we get the messiness. I need to be thinking about the thirty people  impacted  by  a  decision and communicate to them. I need to have a means by which they become aware of what is happening. They need to be able to give me feedback that might lead to a changed direction. Stage two thinkers are likely to be frustrated with all this 'over-communication' and they may also work from more of a 'need  to  know  mindset,'  being  careful  not  to  'bother'  subordinates  with information that the leader deems unnecessary for them. These two habits of  thought  clash  because  different  strategies  work  on  one  stage  and  not another. Left unaddressed, this leaves people frustrated with themselves, the organization, and/or others in the organization.

We have people with strong convictions about how the organization or classroom  should  operate.  People  have  preferences  for  a  stage  one,  stage two, or stage three way of thinking. People may not even realize that they are battling over these differences because a certain way of thinking may be all they have ever known. As such, one step toward a resolution seems to be surfacing the source of the challenge.

What about learning in the digital age? How does all of this stage one, two, and three talk relate to nurturing self-directed learners in a school or classroom? Some people approach their learning from a stage two way of thinking. They await direction from a leader to shape their learning. Tell me what to learn and how to learn it. Yet, those same people may also operate from a stage three mindset for learning when they are away from school or the workplace. They choose what, how, and when to learn about gardening, playing an instrument, discovering the nuances of having a new house built, finding the best prices for a product or service, etc. It seems to me that we think differently about learning depending upon the context.

The problem is that a person with stage two thinking in the classroom is likely to experience a limit to their growth in an organization. They follow rules well, but they never learned to own their learning and to improvise. They wait for  orders.  When  told  what  and  how  to  learn,  they  do  it  well. What happens when they encounter problems with unclear solutions? They turn to an authority to solve it for them or they are overwhelmed. This is more than just collaborating with their boss and others to explore a solution (which seems valuable and wise). They want someone to direct them. Just tell me what to do.

I see this tension between stage two and three thinking in some of our schools,  and  I  am  concerned  about  it.  I  read  student  complaints  about professors,  and  parent  complaints  about  K-12  teachers  who  did  not  give students the answers. 'How am I supposed to learn something if they don't give me the answers?' There are teachers who think the same way. They are wonderfully  organized,  often  engaging  and  beloved;  but  they  are  not necessarily  helping  students  develop  into  stage  three  learners.  We  have schools that are re-imagining formal education with stage three thinking in mind,  and  there  is  much  that  we  can  learn  from  these  schools.  I  have learned about and visited dozens of these schools, and I've learned that it can be approached effectively in different ways. In fact, every stage three school is unique. We can learn from them, but there is no certain recipe for perfectly replicating them (a difference between a sentient living organism and a machine).

It  is  still  important  to  be  able  to  learn  from  highly  structured  and authoritarian contexts. That is a valuable life skill even in an increasingly connected world. I turn to 'experts' all the time to sit at their feet and learn from them. I can enjoy a good lecture or keynote. I appreciate the fact that I do not know what I do not know, and that I sometimes need to trust or lean on those ahead of me to get a solid start when learning something new or complex. This is important, but it just is not enough today.

It is why I often refer back to the value of helping students build their personal  learning  networks.  When  I  interview  people,  I  always  ask  them what  they  do  to  stay  current  in  their  work,  how  they  spend  unstructured time on the job. I ask how they go about learning something new and how they seek to solve messy problems. I ask how they function in contexts with the  goals  are  unclear,  and  what  they  would  do  if  suddenly  said  that everything  on  their  'to-do  list'  at  work  was  complete.  When  I  hire someone, I am looking for self-directed learners, and helping one cultivate such thinking and habits is a wonderful gift that will better prepare students for life and learning in an increasingly networked global society. If we fail to help students become confident and competent with level three thinking, we may be unknowingly setting them up for disappointment and frustration in  the  workplace  and  as  lifelong  learners.  If  we  recognize  the  reality  of these  two  ways  of  thinking,  we  have  an  exciting  opportunity  to  help ourselves and others learn to thrive in a world where stage two and stage three thinking are frequently conflicting and interacting with one another.

## The Digital Divide

EVERY  STUDENT  MATTERS,  BUT  not  evert  student  is  set  up  for  success.  That first sentence is the essence of why the concept of the digital divide matters today.  While  some  people  argue  that  the  problem  of  the  digital  divide  is exaggerated, I will leave that for you to decide. To provide some context, consider the following the categories of digital divide.

## Three Categories of the Digital Divide

We  often segment the digital divide into three distinct but related categories: hardware access, Internet access, and cognitive tools. The first one is the conversation about the digital divide in terms of hardware and software, the haves and the have-nots. If you have a computer, you can take advantage of what a computer can do. If you do not, then you find yourself missing promising opportunities.

When I was less than twelve years old, my father bought me a computer for Christmas. After opening it, my father looked at me and told me to learn how to use this computer because it was the future. That was in the early 1980  s  and  it is hard  to argue  with  his prediction. Computers  are everywhere and computer literacy is a basic and expected set of proficiencies.  Imagine  the  limitations  in  life  if  you  do  not  know  how  to write and edit a paper on a computer, how to load and use software, how to save  and  transfer  files,  and  other  tasks  that  are  common  and  expected aspects of life. Of course, this is no longer adequate.

A solitary computer is useful, but the greatest power comes when it is connected  to  the  rest  of  the  world,  which  is  the  second  category  of  the digital  divide,  which  is  focused  upon  broadband  Internet  access.  This connects you to more people, news, and resources than any other time in history. During President Obama's second term, there was a time when he advocated  funding  for  the  Internet  in  the  homes  of  low-income  families. Why in the world would we spend money on giving people Internet access? Since  when  did  cat  videos  and  Facebook  become  access  and  opportunity issues?  What  about  food,  jobs,  and  other  more  fundamental  needs?  That was the reaction of the critics.

The  reason  behind  this  push  was  the  digital  divide.  In  a  world  where more of the resources are going online, not having immediate access is an increasingly larger disadvantage. Some job postings are only online today, not to mention their preference on how you apply. If you have limited or no Internet  access,  then  you  are  missing  out  on  job  opportunities,  the  most current and diverse news sources, learning resources, the ability to connect as broadly and readily with experts around the world, consumer resources, and  more.  This  might  seem  small  or  insignificant,  but  not  having  access unquestionably puts people at a disadvantage.

Internet  access  is  not  just  about  getting  news  and  resources;  it  is  also about  sharing  and  connecting  with  others.  This  is  the  idea  behind  Austin Kleon's little book Show Your Work . 21 In his text, Kleon proposes that not being  online  and  not  sharing  your  own  work  online  makes  you  largely invisible  to  much  of  the  modern  world.  The  Internet  is  where  we  make countless connections with people and resources, and not being there limits those connections. I experience this on a daily basis as I share my early and rough draft writing ideas online to garner feedback, promote conversations, and build connections. In doing so, I learn from and connect with people throughout the world, not to mention people who live right next to me but first learn about my work online .

Some argue that this is great in an ideal world, but it is not how most people make use of the Internet. I agree. Many people limit their usage to entertainment,  shopping,  and  connecting  with  friends  on  social  media.  At the  same  time,  there  many  others  who  are  harnessing  the  power  of  the Internet for learning and connections, and people gain many advantages and benefits from this. I contend that this is a valuable life skill for our age.

Maybe you have the Internet but you are going to a school that does not teach  you  how  take  advantage  of  it  or  how  to  use  it  for  learning  and achieving  personal  goals.  We  know  that  some  learning  happens  when students  have  more  free  and  unstructured  time  to  explore  and  hang  out online.  This  might  come  in  the  form  of  nurturing  a  hobby,  something ranging  from  computer  programming  to  fan  fiction,  learning  a  foreign language  to  finding  a  tutorial  on  how  to  play  an  instrument.  This  less directed time is, some suggest, an increasingly important way of learning today.  As  such,  there  is  concern  about  the  divide  between  students  with access for this free exploration and those who do not have access. Guidance at  schools  is  valuable,  especially  in  helping  some  students  discover  the learning power of the web, but access in free time is useful for that more self-directed  time.  Or,  we  can  begin  to  imagine  ways  to  provide  some  of that free and exploration time as part of the school experience.

Then  there  is  a  third  phase  of  the  digital  divide,  but  this  is  largely internal,  psychological.  It  is  the  divide  between  one  person  who  says,  'I can' and the other person who says, 'I can't.' It is about the psychological tools that you develop, ones that will help more than hinder your learning and progress. Once you have Internet access and the hardware, I argue that this is one of the most important aspects of the digital divide. What about those  internal  barriers  that  are  keeping  people  from  thriving  and  taking advantage of life in this new connected world? This is where self-directed learning returns as an important aspect of the modern learning environment. There is a divide between those who are competent and confident as selfdirected learners and those who are not .

A  2014  study  suggested  that  people  who  graduate  high  school  with higher Grade Point Averages and with the higher test scores are more likely to have higher incomes, and their quality of life is supposed to be better as well (at least, their sense of well-being in their life). 22 It  is  an  interesting study,  leading  some  to  conclude  that  the  key  to  opportunity  is  getting student GPAs as high as possible. If we do that, then the problem is solved.

I  am  not  convinced  that  is  going  to  solve  the  problem,  and  even  if  it does, it will cause new problems. Let me give you an example of something that challenges this grade point average concept. Imagine that two people graduate from the same college, with the same degree, with the same GPA, they are both interested in the same job, and they apply for it. They both go through  the  application  process,  and  one  graduate  is  clearly  ahead  of  the other in the eyes of the interviewers. The company hires the one and not the other. Let us say that other graduate perseveres and moves on, applying for five more jobs, but does not get hired. This is a realistic scenario. We can find examples of it, which suggests that GPA and test scores do not tell the entire story. We all know that GPA is not the only factor, but what is the entire story?

There are other traits that are important for us in our lives, in our lives as citizens,  in  our  families,  in  the  workplace,  and  beyond.  Helping  people recognize the importance of these other skills and nurturing them is a key to empowering  self-directed  learners.  Some  people  actually  suggest  that bringing character traits and mindsets into the conversation is classist, that we do not tell the wealthy and elite families that they need to develop these skills. I am not convinced that is true. In fact, we can find people from all classes and all socioeconomic statuses who have these other skills that are not represented as clearly through GPA and test scores. I am referring to a long list of traits like grit and perseverance, learning the power of certain forms  of  practice  over  others,  conscientiousness,  the  ability  to  postpone gratification, problem-solving,  collaboration, goal-setting, social skills, emotional intelligence, and many more .

These are all traits that we can nurture by creating more opportunity for self-directed learning. At the 2015 SXSWEdu Conference in Austin Text, I attended a session by a representative of Koru. The representative described their  work  on  college  graduate  readiness,  especially  those  who  graduate from a great school, with a great GPA, but according to employers, they are missing  something  else.  Koru  tried  to  codify  this  and  narrow  it  down  to seven  areas.  They  call  it  the  Koru  7  .  They  include  grit,  rigor,  polish, impact, curiosity, teamwork, and ownership.  23

According to their research, these are the traits that help people thrive in the  workplace,  but  if  you  think  about  it,  they  are  traits  that  work  well  in family, in citizenship, in the workplace, in community-all over the place. Proponents of the liberal arts might look at a list like that and argue that a quality liberal arts college degree is an excellent way to nurture such traits, but at least in the case of Koru's research, that is not necessarily happening.

Part of the challenge comes back to nurturing a mindset of self-directed learning. Consider how the Koru 7 shows up as students work on more selfdirected learning and projects in a school. They learn grit as they preserve with a problem, project, or question over weeks and months, not just for a single unit or lesson. They do not just finish an assignment and move on to the  next  one.  They  need  to  dig  deep,  stretching  and  challenging  their abilities  (rigor).  They  must  persist  until  they  have  a  refined  and  elegant answer or solution, and they are able to communicate it effectively to others (polish).  They learn to ask questions, explore, and experiment (curiosity). Along  the  way,  they  work  with  others  to  accomplish  shared  goals,  assist classmates,  and  gain  needed  assistance  from  people  in  and  out  of  the classroom (teamwork and collaboration). They must take the lead on all of this and see it through to the end (ownership). Of course, depending upon the nature of their project, they also have opportunity to engage in work that makes a difference and has a demonstrable and lasting benefit (impact) .

These  are  traits  that  help  us  grow  as  competent  and  confident  selfdirected  learners.  If you  visit  schools  and  classrooms,  you  will  find countless teachers who believe in these traits, but the curricula and learning experiences  are  not  designed  to  intentionally,  strategically  nurture  them. Some  schools  are  adjusting,  but  others  are  not.  Nurturing  these  kinds  of capacities in every learner will help overcome that digital divide more than anything else. The starting point is simple. We start by asking an important pair  of  questions.  How  can  we  nurture  these  non-cognitive  skills  that  are just as important as measures like grade point average and test score? Why types of learning experiences and learning environments will best foster the development  of  these  skills?  As  more  teachers  and  schools  deeply  and honestly grapple with these questions, they find that some of our traditional practices are holding us back from achieving these important goals. They soon start to seek out and implement new strategies that quite often end up looking more like self-directed learning.

## A Fourth Category

While hardware and software, Internet access, and mental tools are usually the three main areas of digital divide that we discuss, I want to finish this chapter  with  one  that  warrants  being  set  apart  as  a  fourth  and  distinct category. This is about access to possibilities and perspectives that nurture a sense of purpose and meaning making for students. It is not unlike what I described  earlier  in  the  book  when  I  told  the  story  about  the  boy  who wanted to be a mortician when he grew up.

In northern Wisconsin there are not a lot of people. I visit there a few times and year and you can easily find spots where you see more wildlife than people. Imagine a young woman who lives in North Wisconsin. She lives in a small town of one hundred, and she has Internet access. She reads a book through the library that captured her interest. It was about some of the endangered species in the world. Maybe it was about saving endangered whales .

Since there are not many whales in North Wisconsin, I doubt that you will find many activists focused on saving the whales. This young woman is not going find a local group or community to nurture this passion, but when it  comes  to  the  digital  world,  the  connected  world,  she  can.  She  has  the ability  to  get  online  and  find  other  people  who  are  passionate  about  this topic. By building such connections with people online, she is also igniting a passion in herself. She is developing and growing this interest in a topic that could make a difference in her life, and maybe eventually, as she gets older,  she  will  have  the  opportunity  to  travel.  This  could  take  her  on  a completely different direction in life, and it all started with some curiosity from a book that led her online, and connected her to people in groups that she would have never met in person. She did not come from a family that traveled widely, so the Internet was probably one of her online outlets for making this type of a connection.

Notice the learning that took place in the story that I just outlined. This young  woman  explored  something  initially  unfamiliar  to  her.  She  found content  online  about  the  subject.  She  connected  with  others  personally engaged with and informed about the subject. From there she expanded her knowledge and even developed a set of values and convictions about it. She was a self-directed learner, not inhibited by the digital divide.

## Common Barriers to Self-blending

IF  YOU  ARE  STILL reading,  then  you  likely  agree  with  me  that  self-directed learning  has  promising  possibilities.  Perhaps  you  already  suspected  that when you picked up the book. Self-directed learning is a powerful way of equipping people to thrive and survive in this connected world, but there are also  common  challenges  and  barriers  to  moving  in  this  direction.  These challenges  and  barriers  are  not  impossible  to  overcome,  but  it  will  take time,  persistence,  and  commitment.  It  also  helps  to  know  about  these challenge before experiencing them in your classroom and school. That is the purpose of this chapter. I will outline a short list of common challenges and  barriers  while  also  offering  a  few  insights  on  how  to  work  through them. These insights come from my direct experiences, as well as my study and  observation  of  self-directed  learning  efforts  in  a  variety  of  learning communities.  24

Over the past decade, I began to incorporate more self-directed learning opportunities  within  otherwise  traditional  courses.  These  typically  took different  forms  of  project-based  learning,  with  learners  having  different levels  of  self-direction.  Most  of  these  courses  took  place  in  otherwise traditional  learning  organizations  with  learners  who  are  deeply  rooted  in traditional  ideas  about  school.  From  these  direct  experiences,  observing self-directed learning efforts in other classrooms, and interviewing people who are working through the process of implementing more opportunities for self-directed learning, certain common reactions begin to emerge. These reactions  range  from  those  who  are  delighted  with  the  opportunity  and thrive, to those who consider such practices an abdication of the proper role as teacher. Let us examine some of these reactions more closely.

## The Schooling Discourse

Especially  when  working  with  future  and  current  teachers,  these  are typically  people  who  accept  (or  at  least  tolerate)  the  traditional  idea  of schooling  and  related  constructs.  While  some  dislike  them,  most  are comfortable thinking about learning in terms of letter grades, quizzes, tests, homework,  lesson  plans,  credit  hours,  grade  point  averages,  learning objectives, discrete courses and subjects, standards, the role of student, and the role of teacher. While those of us involved with other forms of learning are  well  aware  that  none  of  these  are  necessary  for  high-impact  learning, such terms constitute the dominant discourse in formal education. There are certainly different opinions about each of these terms or phrases and how we  use  them,  but  there  is  a  common  acceptance  that  they  make  up  the vocabulary  of  an  educator.  I  mention  this  because  each  of  these  terms conjure certain memories and expectations about a formal learning experience. More broadly, this means that efforts in self-directed learning sometimes clash with certain traditional notions of formal schooling. As a result,  those  who  value  or  find  comfort  in  such  constructs  may  become resistant or critical of alternatives.

There  are  two  main  ways  to  approach  this  challenge:  build  on  new ground, or re-describe and expand on existing terms. One is to focus upon new  ground,  learning  experiences  outside  of  the  confines  of  traditional schooling. People do not expect to use 'schooling' terminology when they are exploring a topic for fun and on their 'free time.' Most of us do not use schooling vocabulary when we think of relationships, hobbies, or even our work. The digital world gives us ample opportunities to do this, with the rapid  growth  in  resources  for  informal  and  self-directed  learning  on  the web. A second option is to expand on the definitions of schooling terms, to engage in re-description of these terms. This involves accepting the value of a term like assessment, but then expanding our understanding of assessment by  discussing  concepts  like  assessment  as  learning,  self-assessment,  and peer-to-peer learning. In my work, this second option seems to provide the most  value  since  the  learners  that  I  serve  are  usually  in  more  traditional schooling settings. At the same time, a few high-impact experiences with the first approach (out-of-school learning) is a powerful tool for helping us consider  the  possibilities.  Debriefing  those  experiences  with  discussion about what we can apply to our schools has great potential.

## While the Brain Thrives on Novelty, it also Find Comfort in Familiarity

Even while some people are open to exploring new approaches to teaching and learning, too rapid of a shift toward self-directed learning can provoke fear,  self-doubt,  criticism,  and  uncertainty.  As  a  result,  introducing  selfdirected learning is often not effective with an overnight transformation of the classroom. Many will not be prepared emotionally or intellectually for such a task.

As you will read more than once in this book, a simple way of thinking about  teacher-directed  versus  self-directed  is  by  looking  at  the  questions that  drive  the  design  of  a  lesson  or  unit:  What  do  students  need  to  learn? How will I know if they learned it? How will I monitor their progress? How will I help them learn it? The goal of self-directed learning is to eventually turn each of those into student-centered questions: What do I need to learn? How will I know when I have learned it? How will I monitor my progress? How will I learn it? If learners lack the competence, confidence or both of these to ask and answer such questions, that will conjure negative emotions and reactions.

The  good  news  is  that  many  students  and  teachers  are  used  to  these types  of  questions.  That  is  why  I  will  later  outline  how  we  can  use  this familiar  vocabulary  to  invite  the  students  into  designing  some  of  their learning experiences or at least part of an existing learning experience. We can  use  the  familiarity  of  these  terms  to  alleviate  some  anxiety  while gradually shifting the locus of control from teacher to student.

## Self-directed Learning Skills

One  of  the  more  effective  ways  to  address  this  lack  of  competence  or confidence is to devise a plan to help students grow in their capacity to ask and  answer  the  questions  of  the  self-directed  learner.  We  can  do  this gradually, starting by inviting learner input on the goals for a given unit and how to best assess the learning. There may be 'non-negotiable' standards or outcomes, but learners can enhance or supplement them. They can also cooperate  with  the  teacher  to  create  a  solid  assessment  plan.  In  addition, self-directed  learning  can  be  preceded  by  formal  opportunities  to  grow  in skills  with  goal-setting,  self-assessment  methods  and  strategies,  skills  in self-monitoring,  and  building  a  toolbox  of  learning  and  self-teaching strategies. Many teachers find great success by actually devoting interactive lessons on these discrete skills so that students can develop the competence to self-direct more fully.

This is not unlike teaching someone to drive. At first they learn about driving in a driver's education class. Then they get to practice driving but with closer supervision. Later they might get a probationary driver's license that  allows  them  to  drive  with  an  appropriate  and  licensed  adult.  Finally, once they pass the written and driving test, they earn a license to drive on their  own.  I  am  not  necessarily  suggesting  that  we  replicate  that  exact process, but some sort of scaffolded effort to prepare students for this level of independence and give the student, teacher, parents, and others time  to understand and prepare for later and more immersive self-directed learning opportunities.  In  fact,  even  in  schools  that  are  almost  entirely  designed around self-directed learning, it is common for them to have one resource course  or  extended  learning  experience  that  helps  prepare  students  with some of the key skills for thriving as a self-directed learner.

When  I  have  incorporated  opportunity  for  self-directed  learning  in classes,  the  struggles  usually  relate  to  this  area  of  competency  and/or confidence. Some students are able to flourish right away, while others seek more direction and guidance. From my perspective, this is natural, and it speaks  to  the  ongoing  value  of  a  teacher/mentor/coach  for  groups  of learners, helping each learner progress toward greater levels of independence. Necessary support, mentoring and resources often make the differences  between  a  successful  and  unsuccessful  move  toward  selfdirected learning.

## Missing the 'Why' of Self-Directed Learning

We dedicated an entire chapter to this subject, but skills and confidence are not the online factor, and a compelling reason for self-directed learning is helpful for all stakeholders. Beliefs and values play a critical role. For this reason, the why of self-directed learning is a critical conversation. It is not adequate  to  talk  about  it  once  and  then  move  on.  This  needs  to  be  a frequent, maybe even daily conversation, especially at the beginning.

In  fact,  for  it  to  be  successful,  this  requires  a  cultural  change  within learning organizations, a move toward a compelling why. Why self-directed learning? What is limiting about the traditional teacher-directed environment? This challenges us to look at the broader aims of education. This  is  where  we  might  look  at  self-directed  learning  as  a  means  of championing  human  agency,  increasing  access  and  opportunity,  and  the critical import of self-efficacy to address any number of broader issues in society.  We  can  also  ground  it  in  how  the  skills  of  self-directed  learning with  empower and equip learners to  more  fully  achieve  their  current  and future goals. This comes  through  discussion,  storytelling, real world examples,  and  a  guided  activities  that  give  ample  opportunity  for  self- discovery  of  the  many  compelling  reasons  behind  self-directed  learning. You know that you are making progress in this area when the students and parents start to effectively and passionately articulate the important reasons behind the shift.

## Teacher Convictions and Values

Teachers do not usually go into the  profession  because  of  the  size  of  the paycheck.  They  obviously  need  a  living  wage,  but  most  teachers  go  into education because they care about students, what they will teach, or maybe a combination of the three. Yet, even before becoming a classroom teacher, we develop a set of beliefs and convictions about what works and what does not  work  in  education.  We  have  our  preferred  practices,  methods,  and approaches.  Sometimes  we  refine  these  convictions  based  upon  research and careful consideration, but not always. Sometimes our idea emerge from personal experiences both as students and teachers.

These  convictions  are  evident  in  almost  every  classroom.  Just  ask  a group of teachers to tell you about what they do in their classrooms, and they  will  quickly  start  to  incorporate  some  of  their  convictions  and  their values.

- 'In my class, every student matters.'
- 'In my classroom, students are kind, courteous, quiet, and organized.'
- 'My classroom is fun and playful, but everyone knows that I'm the boss.'
- 'In my class, everyone works hard. That is a non-negotiable. When you step in the room, you are ready to work.'
- 'I like to keep a tight rein on the class so we stay focused.'
- 'There is a time and place for everything in my classroom.'

Each  of  these  statements  not  only  represent  what  happens  a  teacher's classroom. They also give us clues about the teacher's underlying  beliefs and values. This is an important starting place because a common barrier for  self-directed  learning  relates  to  teacher  beliefs  and  values.  In  my experience,  there  are  three  main  challenges  that  in  this  regard.  First, teachers  usually  want  order  and  accountability.  Second,  some  teachers grapple with what seems like a shifting view of the role of teacher versus the  role  of  student.  Third,  as  teachers,  we  like  to  be  valued  and  needed. Let's go through each of these three, one at a time.

## Order and Accountability

The last thing that a teacher wants is to set up the conditions like what we read in The Jungle . If you believe that self-directed learning is about chaos, disorder, and a lack of accountability; then we are not going to get very far in  the  conversation.  In  fact,  as  a  teacher,  I  completely  agree.  We  want accountability,  and  we  do  not  want  chaos.  However,  as  we  create  more space  for  self-directed  learning,  it  will  challenge  us  to  consider  what  it looks like to maintain order and what it means to have accountability.

This usually comes down to a matter of control. Teachers often want to know  that  they  are  still  in  control.  They  feel  responsible  to  keep  the classroom  safe  and  a  place  where  learning  takes  place.  Of  course,  as teachers, we are often accountable for student learning as it relates to a set of standards. While some people reading this book are free from expectations  about  such  matters,  many  readers  are  in  traditional  schools where  failing  in  one  or  more  of  these  areas  is  a  recipe  for  disaster  and maybe even for losing your job.

What is important to remember is that creating space for self-directed learning is not an either-or proposition. You can take small steps. You can begin by experimenting with a single project. Or, you can go back to the first chapter in this book where I offer a list of ideas on where to start. You can implement a personal learning network project that students work on throughout the year without changing too much else of what you do. You can  begin  to  elicit  greater  student  input  in  some  of  the  lessons  and  the evaluations of what went well and what did not in the lessons. You can look for  ways  to  invite  greater  student  voice  and  choice  in  ways  that  do  not detract from the standards that you are required to make the priority.

Concerns about control and accountability usually come from thinking about the more immersive examples of self-directed learning, and for those readers who have such concerns, I simply suggest that you set those more 'extreme' examples aside for now. Take small steps. Just start with some ideas  that  allow  you  to  maintain  the  control  and  accountability  that  are important to you.

With that said, after you try this for a semester or two, I encourage you to stretch yourself a little bit more, but before you try something larger, I suggest  that you  get online and  search  for schools  that have  more immersive  self-directed  learning  projects.  Reach  out  to  these  schools. Interview people. If they allow it and you can fit it into your schedule, try to visit  the  classroom  or  school  and  see  it  in  action.  Many  concerns  comes from  struggling  to  envision  what  it  would  look  like  to  have  a  more  selfdirected  learning  classroom,  and  seeing  a  few  of  them  can  be  incredibly helpful.  Of  course,  you  want  to  seek  out  good  examples,  since  there  are certainly poorly managed examples of self-directed learning environments.

## Teacher Versus Student

What is the role of the teacher and what is the role of the student? Many of us  see  the  teacher  has  having  the  role  of  setting  the  goals,  planning  the lesson,  directing  the  lesson,  holding  the  students  accountable,  assessing students according  to some  set of standards, helping students make adequate  progress  in  their  learning,  and  keeping  the  classroom  a  positive and safe environment. Students have the role of coming to class prepared and  ready  to  work,  respecting  the  teacher  and  classmates,  working  hard, seeking  the  teacher's  help  when  there  is  a  challenge,  and  following instructions. At least, that is what I discovered when I conducted a random informal interview of a dozen teachers in preparation for writing this .

How  does  this  change  with  more  self-directed  learning  exercises?  I argue  that  all  of  these  elements  still  need  to  be  present  in  one  way  or another. It is just a question of how we get there. I agree that a teacher in most schools is hired to make sure that learning happens. It is just that there are many ways for that to take place. Consider different leadership styles in a  business  environment.  Some  bosses  are  more  hands  on  and  others  are more  hands  off.  Most  teachers  see  themselves  as  the  boss  of  the  class. While I argue that there are other equally effective ways of thinking about the role, let's just work with the boss analogy. Some bosses micro-manage every  aspect  of  the  work,  carefully  directing  each  person  on  each  task. Other  bosses  set  a  broad  framework  in  which  others  work,  and  the  boss steps in when needed. I contend that this second approach works well in the classroom also.

If you look back to the list of teacher responsibilities that I just shared, I am not suggesting that we get rid of any of those tasks. It is just a question of who takes the lead on this or what role students get to play in that regard. Assessment still needs to take place, but is it possible to involve students in the creation and/or selection of assessments? Goals still need to be set and lessons need to be planned. To what extent can we invite students to create or  co-create  some  of  that?  As  such,  teachers  can  still  see  themselves  as ultimately in control.

I have  visited  enough  classrooms  where  teachers  do  not  think  of themselves as the boss and it worked well. They took the time to help the class begin to see themselves as a democratic community with responsibilities to hold themselves and one another accountable. The might step in to guide and redirect in subtle ways, but as the community develops, and  if  there  is  a  robust  and  working  system  of  peer  accountability,  the teacher can step back and trust the community in more of these areas. Yet, that is not the case with most traditional classrooms. That might be a future aspiration, but for most classrooms, I suggest starting small.

Try a few self-directed learning efforts and see what happens. Monitor the progress. See what works; see what does not work. Do not give up after the first attempt because hardly any of us get things right the first time we try them. Could you imagine deciding to learn how to play the piano, trying to play it once, and then quitting because it did not work? Learning to play the piano takes years of practice. Learning to nurture self-directed learners takes  time  as  well.  It  takes  patience,  persistence,  practice,  and  a  dose  of humility  because  you  will  make  mistakes.  Yet,  with  persistence,  this  can and does work.

## Being Valued

Many of us do not like to admit this, but it feels good to be wanted and valued by your students. I have spoken to plenty of teachers who directly stated  that,  'This  is  why  I  do  what  I  do!'  That  is  why  so  many  teachers keep  a  box  of  thank  you  letters  and  words  of  encouragement  that  they receive  from  students  over  the  years.  Some  of  those  treasured  letters  are about how students achieved goals later in life, but others are just words of appreciation. 'You are the best teacher in the world!' Who does not like to be appreciated and valued by others?

Other teachers, even if we do not like to admit it, enjoy being the center of  attention.  Consider  the  fact  classrooms  are  named  after  the  teacher  in many  schools.  If  I  had  a  classroom,  it  would  be  called  'Dr.  Bull's Classroom.' The classroom is seen as my domain, and we each have ideas of what we want students to think and say about the our classroom.

'He is a hard but fair teacher, and he usually keeps things interesting.' 'He is one of the kindest and most caring people that I've ever met.'

'She is one of the smartest people that I know.'

'If you are willing to work hard, she will make sure that you do well.'

Each person might be seeking a different affirmation, but these sorts of statements  become  important  to  many  of  us  as  teachers.  For  that  reason, moving toward self-directed learning is a change for us. We are, to some extent,  sharing  the  stage  with  the  students  or  even  stepping  off  the  stage altogether. The student becomes more central and our goal is to be only as involved as necessary. When students are learning and so engaged that they forget that the teacher is around, that is considered a success.

I at least want to acknowledge that this is a struggle for some teachers at first. At the same time, what is more rewarding for a teacher than to see a student engaged, thriving, and self-reliant? That is our focus and goal as we devote more time and attention to self-directed learning.

## The Student Mindset

Another common barrier is the student mindset. Most students have grown up in a largely teacher-directed school environment. They are waiting for the teacher to tell them what to do, when to do it, and how to do it. It is common for some students to struggle as you introduce more self-directed learning  opportunities.  They  might  even  make  comments  that  cut  to  the heart of the teacher, statements about the teacher failing to do his or her job.

It is not wise to ignore such statements, but it is equally unwise to just give  up  when  this  happens.  Learning  to  be  more  independent  and  selfdirected  takes  time  and  effort.  It  usually  does  not  happen  immediately. Remind students about this. Give students a chance to process what they are feeling and thinking. It also helps to show them examples of where they are going and what they will be able to do if they persist. You can even bring in remote guests from other classes and schools who are more self-directed in nature. Student to student mentoring can be especially helpful.

Also,  it  is  important  to  note  that  self-directed  learning  is  not  usually about the teacher just sitting at the desk while students teach themselves. The teacher still plays an important role of coach, mentor, game or learning experience designer, facilitator of connections, and much more .

If  we  go  back  to  the  piano  analogy  that  I  provided  earlier,  you  don't learn this instantly. We cannot put students in front of a piano and expect them to  be  able  to  play  something  perfectly  the  first  time.  If  you  have  a classroom of students learning to play the piano, each one is going to learn at a different pace. They will each have different needs. The same thing is true  with  nurturing  self-directed  learners.  Some  students  will  embrace  it right away. Others will struggle for quite a while, and you will coach and guide them along the way.

In  full  candor,  there  will  be  some  students  who  may  never  seem  to resonate with a more self-directed learning environment. Yet, these students can  still  learn  to  thrive  in  the  classroom.  The  key  to  that  is  usually  by building  a  strong  and  positive  community.  Students  look  out  for  one another. They enjoy being with and learning with one another. They mentor one another. They hold one another accountable. If you can guide students into  helping create such a community, then even the students who do not seem drawn to more self-directed activities can learn and benefit from being more of such a community.

## The Parent Mindset

This  is  not  what  many  parents  experienced  in  school,  so  some  will  be unaware of the benefits. Self-directed learning activities are not consistent with  their  experiences,  and  they  do  not  know  how  to  assess  how  their children are doing. Are they making progress, or are they not? One of the key ways to overcome this barrier is frequent and meaningful communication with the parents. It starts before you even try your first selfdirected learning exercises in the classroom or in the school. Convey a clear vision and invite their feedback and involvement. Of course, you also want be  sure  to  communicate  the  why  before  you  start,  while  sharing  frequent updates  about  what  is  happening,  the  challenges  that  you  are  facing  and overcoming as a class, and the wins. Selecting pictures of students in action with a few paragraphs may be all that it takes .

It  can  also  be  helpful  to  provide  a  question  an  answer  resource  at  the beginning. How will I know whether my child is making progress? What is the role of the teacher? What is the role of the student? What is the role of the parent? What is the timeline? What are they doing when and why. Then, be sure to invite parents to events where students display their work and tell stories of their learning. Invite parents to ask students questions. Of all the ways that I have seen to help students better understand the vision, these public presentations are among the most powerful.

## School Policies and Practices

Depending upon the nature of the self-directed learning project or activities, you  may  experience  challenges  because  of  standard  school  policies  and practices. These policies and practices were often created to support more traditional  approaches  to  teaching  and  learning.  Some  of  them  will  be beyond  your  ability  to  change  or  adjust,  so  you  will  initially  need  to  be creative  about  how  you  can  work  within  them.  There  will  come  a  time, however, when you want to do something that does not fit the policies and practices. When this occurs, it is time to work with school leadership. Share your  vision,  the  compelling  reason,  and  what  you  think  is  needed  to  be successful. If you engage leadership in your smaller and earlier exercises, inviting  input  and  involvement,  then  these  larger  conversations  are  much easier. Sometimes this will just emerge naturally over time.

Of course, some school leaders might not be as supportive at first. While respecting the policies, you can persist in trying to make a compelling case for why you think this is important for your students. You can take time to listen and learn from concerns and critiques. You can respect the wishes of leadership  while  finding  small  but  significant  ways  to  engage  students  in owning their learning and playing and active role in co-creating the learning experiences.

There are limitations to what you can do in a traditional school context with  self-directed  learning,  but  your  smaller  efforts  are  not  insignificant. When you go to a fully self-directed  school  where  students  can  immerse themselves  in  a  single  project  for  weeks  and  months,  it  is  inspiring  and amazing to see the maturity and engagement of the learners. You might not see  the  same  depth  and  level  of  transformation,  but  you  can  still  help students  make  good  progress.  Even  if  you  never  experience  that  more immersive models, your slow and steady efforts to nurture self-direction in your  classroom  is  an  important  part  of  preparing  your  students  for  the future. Simply making small changes that invite students into setting goals, planning  lessons,  and  devising  feedback  plans  can  go  a  long  way  in nurturing the mindset of a lifelong self-directed learner. You can even do this within the most traditional policies and school practices.

A common challenge is the concern about student motivation. What about the  students  who  just  sit  round  and  do  nothing?  Of  course,  this  is  just  as possible  with  self-directed  learning  as  it  is  with  many  other  forms  of teaching and learning. However, it is a legitimate concern even thought, in my  experience,  it  is  far  less  common  than  some  fear.  As  such,  I  like  to approach to concern by referring to the broader concept of motivation.

As we already explored in this chapter, not every student in a projectbased or self-directed learning environment will be excited about this new model.  It  takes  more  effort.  It  is  counter  to  many  of  the  school  success strategies learned through years of a traditional model. There are often new skills, disciplines and dispositions that one needs to nurture to get the most of out of these experiences. Nonetheless, almost everyone has been engaged by a project-based or self-directed learning experience at some point in life. As a result, teachers in self-directed environments quickly learn that calling an activity self-directed or giving students greater choice does not magically  change  the  classroom  culture.  Not  every  student  instantly  gets excited  about  the  idea  of  getting  immersed  or  even  lost  in  a  project  or inquiry.

To address this, I find it helpful to go back to instructional design basics. In  fact,  I  still  return  to  Lepper  and  Malone's  1987  chapter  on  'Making Learning  Fun:  A  Taxonomy  of  Intrinsic  Motivations  for  Learning.' 26 In this  chapter,  they  outline  six  types  of  intrinsic  motivators  for  learning: challenge,  curiosity,  power,  fantasy,  cooperation  and  competition,  and recognition. They  offer teachers (and students) ways  to  think about addressing  low  motivation  while  still  advocating  for  the  growth  and development of self-directed learners.

## 1 . Challenge

A  student  tends  to  be  more  intrinsically  motivated  when  there  is  a  right challenge fit. Csikszentmihalyi writes about this in his work on Flow . 27 Challenge is not simply about deciding what is the right level of challenge for a student. There is more subjectivity it. A student may have immense competence  in  an  area  but  lose  motivation  when  having  to  work  on  a challenge that is well within her abilities. That is because challenge is more about  the  learner's  perception  of  both  the  challenge  and  her  own  skills related to that challenge.

Understanding a student's self-esteem becomes important in finding the right  challenge  fit.  We  begin  to  address  challenge  by  helping  learners establish goals that are appropriately challenging, but have a stretch element to  them. A measure of uncertainty about whether one can accomplish the goal can help with motivation, granted that it is not too much uncertainty. We want a goal that is the right level of challenge, difficult enough to be worthy of pursuit, but not so difficult as to instill a sense of certain failure.

Also, when working with students who are new to self-directed learning, it is useful to start with shorter term goals. Just like it can be helpful for an aspiring marathoner to start with the goal of a 5 K, it is helpful for a student to  begin with a shorter term project. Without hope of success, motivation plummets,  so  figuring  out  challenge  becomes  critical.  Feedback  also becomes  important.  If  students  are  uncertain  about  their  ability  to  face  a challenge, more frequent feedback may be necessary at first to help build confidence. Keep in mind, however, that low self-esteem in academic areas may have built up for over a decade, so a few days or weeks will probably not  be  enough  to  help  build  the  confidence  to  embrace  and  overcome significant academic challenges. Given this fact, small but significant selfdirected learning wins will help students build the confidence to face larger challenges.

There is another element to this in some environments, and that is the confidence  drop  that  comes  from  seeing  other  students  work  on  projects that seem more significant. In a traditional class, some students get higher grades than others, but everyone is generally working on the same things. In a self-directed learning environment, the wide spectrum of student projects becomes  clear. This can motivate and inspire some  students while demotivating  others.  There  is  still  benefit  in  these  comparisons  (as  I  will mention later), but beware of the impact on self-esteem as well.

## 2 . Curiosity

Lepper and Malone distinguish between two types of curiosity: sensory and cognitive. 28 The  first  has  to  do  with  the  physical  senses.  As  such,  it  is useful to ask if the learning spaces and the available learning resources are stimulating. How are the senses engaged? This is why Maria Montessori's philosophy of education pays so much attention to the environment and the learning resources in that environment. Take a few minutes and browse the web for images of Montessori classrooms. It does not take long to get the idea. Cognitive curiosity, however, relates to the drive for us to make sense of things. When  we  are convinced that we do not have a clear understanding of something that is important to us or that our understanding is incomplete, that can conjure cognitive curiosity. Or, if something in our thinking is inconsistent with reality, that too evokes curiosity. 29

Learning to ask questions that spark curiosity  is,  therefore,  a  valuable skill for teacher and student. This is not just an exercise in creating lists of interesting  questions  about  a  subject.  If  it  is  going  to  awaken  intrinsic motivation  through  curiosity,  it  must  be  about  surfacing  inconsistencies, incompleteness, and a lack of clarity about something of personal importance to the learner.

## 3 . Control

As with challenge, we are not just talking about the objective measure of control given to students in the learning environment. We are referring to the perceived  amount  of  control. The  perception  of control impacts motivation more than the reality of it. 30 If you see unmotivated learners in a context, what is their perception of control?

One way to get at this is to make sure student choice is available, choice about  what  questions  to  pursue  and  how  to  pursue  them.  This  does  not mean  making  everything  completely  open-ended,  as  that  can  overwhelm (think back to challenge) and de-motivate. Lepper and Malone suggest that 5-7  choices  is  ideal  for  many  environments.  Or,  if  there  are  unlimited choices, it will help to offer clear guidance on how to narrow things down. 31 Regardless, giving choice or increasing the perception of choice elevates intrinsic motivation.

Related to choice is also the concept of power, where a learner's choices have obvious and significant implications. When a learner can see that her choices  made  a  large  difference,  this  impacts  motivation.  This  is  another reason  feedback  and  shorter  projects  can  help  build  intrinsic  motivation, because both are ways to show the impact of a person's individual choices. 32

## 4 . Fantasy

In the original chapter by Lepper and Malone, their reference to fantasy is in  the  context  of  games  and  learning,  so  my  reflection  here  may  deviate well  beyond  their  intended  use  of  the  term. 33 Malone  worked  from  the following definition of fantasy, 'mental images of things not present to the senses or within the actual experience of the person involved.'  34  This can be  effective  with  teacher-directed  project-based  learning  by  building  a project into an immersive fantasy experience. It can also be used for more self-directed  projects.  Many  teachers  find  great  success  creating  launch events  for  new  projects  that  incorporate  fantasy  and  imagination  as  a framework for the projects.

Helping  students  learn  how  to  use  their  imagination  with  regard  to projects  can  also  be  a  powerful  motivator.  Invite  students  to  imagine  the potential  impact  of  their  project  upon  one  or  more  people.  Encourage students to use fantasy and imagination as they work on their projects. They might, for example, create fictional characters for whom they are designing the project.

## 5 . Cooperation and Competition

While I rarely think about leveraging competition in my classroom, there are  ways  that  people  do  so  in  self-directed  learning  contexts,  like  having students pitch ideas, and a panel rates their performance, perhaps giving a first, second and third place. Or, there might be a more objective element of competition, with people or groups competing to create an object that has the largest impact in some way. Think of projects where groups are given $10 with the goal of having the greatest social impact with the money. Or, there are the popular projects around protecting an egg with some sort of design, or creating a paper airplane that can fly the greatest distance .

Similarly,  charging  entire  classes  or  groups  to  work  together  in  the accomplishment of a significant challenge or socially relevant project can be a powerful motivator. This sense of team can be incredibly motivating for students, especially at certain developmental stages.

In fact, even in instances where the project and learning itself seems to be  a  bit  less  motivating  for  some  students,  building  a  positive,  fun,  and encouraging  community  of  learners  can  make  up  the  difference.  Many students are highly social by nature, and they just consider doing the work a responsibility  of  membership  in  that  community.  While  the  ideal  is  for every student to love the learning itself, it is unwise to ignore this deeply social reality. If you can help nurture a positive community where students support one another, value their learning, and pass that on to one another;

then  you  are  well  on  your  way  to  building  a  world-class  self-directed learning community.

## 6 . Recognition

This may seem like extrinsic motivation, but Lepper and Malone describe recognition  as  intrinsic  because  it  comes  from  a  need  for  approval  or recognition.  This  is  an  area  that  is  often  highlighted  by  project-based learning  advocates,  noting  the  benefit  of  an  authentic  audience  for  the product. However, recognition can also be used throughout the process by making learner progress, discoveries and developments more visible to the community  throughout  the  learning  experience.  A  class  blog,  practice presentations, frequent show and tell exercises, a scheduled public exhibition,  and  the  like  build  opportunities  for  recognition  throughout  the self-directed learning process. Adding these into the design is consistently ranked  as  a  high-impact  strategy  among  those  who  are  striving  to  build more self-directed learning communities .

## Motivation Conclusion

Self-directed  learning  environments  have  many  exciting  possibilities  and affordances, but they do not usually happen by chance. Teachers still play a valuable  role  in  designing  spaces  and  contexts  that  lead  to  motivation. Teachers can construct motivating learning challenges and experiences, and helping  students  learn  to  motivate  themselves.  As  such,  the  six  items mentioned in the prior pages provide you with a good starting place.

## Barrier Conclusions

This  is  no  short  and  easy  list  of  challenges  and  barriers.  Promoting  selfdirected learning is hard and persistent work because our education system as a whole does not place a priority on it. Many of the policies, practices, norms, and elements that we value enough to measure are not connected to self-directed learning. Yet, with time and effort, you can be a champion for self-directed  learning  in  ways  that  truly  benefit  your  students.  These  are certainly easy barriers to overcome, especially given that most of them are mindset barriers, but progress is both rewarding and achievable. It begins with working through the barriers challenges that exist in our own minds, then working with other key stakeholders to help them discover the power and possibility  of  nurturing  competence  and  confidence  as  a  self-directed learner.  Keep  the  goal  front  and  center,  as  well  as  a  compelling  reason. Then start planning and building a community that helps to work through these and related challenges one by one.

## The Self-Directed Learning Friendly Classroom and School

LET'S GET TO THE nuts and bolts, the classroom. Self-directed learning can happen in homeschool environments. It can happen outside of school. It can happen  in  school.  If  a  student  is  in  a  traditional  school,  and  we  want  to embrace self-directed learning, it has to impact what happens in the daily classroom. So, how do we create a self-directed friendly classroom? It starts with  something  that  I  talked  about  in  the  last  chapter.  A  self-directed friendly  classroom  is  one  where  the  teacher  understands  the  role  and  the value  of  self-directed  learning.  It  is  one  where  the  teacher  has  worked through some of the concerns and the fears, the barriers. It is also one where the  teacher  helps  create  specific  opportunities  for  students  to  engage  in more  self-directed  learning,  which  will  be  the  focus  of  this  chapter. Following are specific steps that you can take to create a classroom where students are progressing toward greater competence and confidence as selfdirected learners.

## [Inviting Students Behind the Scenes]

Using  the  metaphor  of  a  theater,  where  do  you  picture  students  in  the learning process? Are they the actors on the stage? Or, are they the people in  the  audience,  enjoying  the  performance  of  the  teacher?  Or,  maybe  the students are the playwrights, the directors, the actors, the critic sitting it the audience, or maybe members of the tech crew. The more traditional answer might  be  that  students  are  either  the  audience  members  or  the  actors following  the  instructions  of  the  director.  When  we  begin  to  think  about how to nurture self-directed learning, we are envisioning a classroom where students  experience  many  or  all  of  these  roles  at  one  time  or  another. Students are invited into the audience, but they are also invited behind the scene. They are even invited to help write the plays in which they act.

As such, a great starting point in the classroom is taking the lesson plan and putting it in front of the students. It is inviting students to be partners in the design of the lesson. You are recognizing that the classroom is not your classroom  as  the  teacher,  but  the  class  belongs  to  the  community.  The community has say about what is learned and how it is learned. Individuals are also given a growing measure of input on those questions that we have visited repeatedly in this text. What do I need to learn? How will I learn it? How will I monitor my progress? How will I know when I have learned it?

They say that the best way to learn something is to teach it, so what we are talking about here is sharing, at least in some ways, the role of teacher with  the  students.  You  are  inviting  them  to  see  themselves  as  co-learners with you as well as co-teachers and co-creators of the learning experiences. As you do this, you will discover that the spirit of self-directed learner will begin to grow in your classroom. You will be well on your way to becoming a self-directed friendly classroom. In the following section, we will look at each  of  these  questions  in  a  bit  more  detail,  considering  how  you  can involve students even if you cannot or do not want to hand over full control to the students.

## What do I need to learn?

You are probably in a context where you have predefined answers to this question  in the form  of  learning  objectives  and  academic  standards. Alongside that, you can also invite the students to establish some of their own  personal  or  group  goals.  This  gives  students  a  chance  to  put  their individual and collective imprint on the lesson. Greater voice will eventually lead to greater ownership .

## How will I learn it?

Even  if  there  is  little  to  not  flexibility  on  the  learning  objectives,  the standards, and the learning goals; most teachers have greater discretion on how students meet the standards. As the teacher, you probably have ideas on how to teach a given concept, but why not involve students into deciding this? Perhaps they can help you come up with more effective and engaging ways to approach a common topic. They might help you design projects, games,  problem-based  learning  experiences,  and  they  might  help  curate online and other resources related to the subject.

What would be the absolute best way for us to meet this learning goal? Invite the students into dreaming up creative and interesting answers to this question.  Why  not  make  it  imaginative  and  fun?  Imagine  that  you  are preparing the next generation of neurosurgeons, and you want to equip them to  conduct  brain  surgery  in  a  way  that  removes  a  tumor  and  the  patient survives. What is the absolute best way to learn how to do that? What is the most effective way to teach or learn this? Well, I would suggest that it is probably to find people with brain tumors, bring them into the classroom, and let students conduct surgeries on the people over and over until they get it right.

Obviously, we have an ethical problem with that approach. So, that is not  realistic,  so  then  we  muse  about  the  next  best  option.  Maybe  it  is observing  others  conducting  surgery  with  a  person  who  is  pointing  out exactly what is happening and how it is happening, and then you get to try it out in a simulated environment. Maybe it is not on a real patient, but it is on  some  sort  of  machine  or  simulated  brain  on  a  computer.  Well,  maybe these  are  not  realistic,  either,  because  you  do  not  have  the  resources.  No matter. Your goal is to invite the students into this conversation about the most authentic and effective way to learn something. Let the students join you in the creation of the learning experiences because, if you have a class of twenty, that is an impressive collection of minds. You will come up with great ideas, the students will experience the job of co-creating, and student engagement is likely to increase .

Know that at first, at least in most classrooms, you are not going to give the students all of the say, but you are giving them a little more voice and choice  than  they  had  before.  Over  time,  you  can  gradually  increase  the amount of voice and choice that you give students, empowering them with growing levels of confidence and competence as self-directed learners. Put them into research teams, and send them out in advance of a unit to figure out creative resources and ways that they could learn something. Have them bring ideas back that they can propose to the class.

I recall one example of a teacher who decided that she was not going to use  a  social  studies  textbook.  Instead,  she  and  the  students  opted  to  cocreate  a  social  studies  textbook,  and  the  students  collectively  started  to figure out all of these facts and issues about history as they wrote a text. They did it in the form of a wiki. That is a great example of how to embrace self-directed learning while still meeting the same basic learning objectives and  academic  standards.  The  students  found  themselves  going  out  and interviewing  experts.  They  interviewed  professors,  scientists,  government leaders,  and  other  key  figures  as  an  integrated  part  of  their  study.  They found  great  resources.  They  learned  to  analyze  these  resources,  to  fact- check them, and they started discovering ideas unlikely to emerge from a single teacher.

## How will I monitor my progress and how will I know when I have learned it?

Just as with the questions about learning goals and the lesson plan, we can also engage students in planning and designing feedback and assessments. Students  can  learn  to  create  a  blend  of  feedback  from  the  teacher,  from external experts, from their peers, from computer software, and even from themselves. By inviting students into the design and selection of feedback and assessment mechanisms, students will also eventually begin to see that the role of feedback is to help them progress in their learning, not just to give them a grade. Too often, students go through class thinking of quizzes, tests,  and  assignments  as  little  more  than  a  means  of  assigning  them  a grade. Somewhere along the way, they lose sight of the fact that all of this is supposed to be in the service of learning and growth. The more that we can engage  students  in  the  design,  the  more  they  will  be  able  to  see  and internalize the proper purpose and role of feedback and assessment. This is not  about  being  rated  and  ranked.  It  is  about  growing  and  pursuing  your best.

## 'How I Did It' Show and Tell

We often  think  of  show  and  tell  as  that  childhood  school  activity  where students bring an object to school. One at a time, students take turns sharing about the object and what it means to the them. Students get to know one another. They are practicing public speaking in a simple and informal way. It is also a chance for the teacher to get to know the students in a new way. Yet,  we  can  also  use  a  very  similar  activity  with  any  age  or  group  of learners as a way to celebrate small examples of self-directed learning.

We can surface and celebrate self-directed learning when students are in a  class  with  traditional  tests,  working  on  individual  or  group  projects,  or they are working on any type of homework or learning experience. The goal is to get students talk to one another about how they are self-blending, what strategies and tools they are using while working in class. For example, one student might have performed very well on a test. Maybe it became public knowledge.  Too  often,  such  success  is  attributed  to  just  being  a  smart student.  It  reinforces  the  idea  that  some  students  are  born  with  a  special ability while others are not. While acknowledging the role of genetics, there are so many other factors that contribute to student success. We know that learning how to study effectively can improve student test scores. We know that  learning  to  conduct  research  and  write  a  research  paper  is  something that students can learn and improve over time. The problem is that we too often focus on what is learned and accomplished, but not how it is learned and accomplished.

This is where show and tell comes to the rescue. When a teacher sees a student improving significantly from one assignment to the next, why not talk to that student about possibly sharing her story with the class. What did she do differently this time and how did it help? When a student completes an impressive project or paper, ask this student to share how he goes about researching and writing. What methods and strategies does he use and why? How  does  he  conduct  the  research?  How  does  he  stay  organized?  What challenges did he face and how did he overcome them?

There is so much for students to learn from one another, and creating show and tell moments like this can quickly begin to demystify learning. Students begin to see that learning is a set of skills that we can develop other time. They  become  reflective  about  how  they  learn.  They  discover  how  much their habits and choices can impact their learning and their performance in school.

Some students might not be ready to volunteer right away, but you can start  by  simply  looking  for  examples,  pulling  those  students  aside,  and privately  asking  if  they  would  consider  sharing  with  the  class.  Some  will decline,  but  once  a  few  students  accept  the  invitation,  you  can  begin  to build important momentum. In fact, those who are sharing come to see how their sharing benefits classmates while also being recognized for a job well done. At the same time, the rest of the class gets to learn from that student. Over  time,  these  show  and  tell  experiences  can  be  rich  and  engaging question-and-answer exchanges, helping to build a stronger culture of selfdirected learning even in otherwise largely teacher-directed classrooms.

## The Personal Learning Network

We already dedicated an entire chapter to this topic, but I include it once more as a reminder, because it one of the easier but more impactful ways to help  students  move  toward  greater  ownership  and  awareness.  Without changing anything else in a class, you can invite students to create a log of the people, resources, and technologies that they are using to learn. Provide time  for  students  to  share  about  their  network  with  others.  Offer  them guidance  on  how  to  refine  and  expand  their  network  to  achieve  different goals. Doing this over a full school year or even multiple years is a good way  give  students  one  more  way  to  think  about  their  personal  role  and responsibility for learning. Of course, this should be something meaningful for  students.  If  students  just  see  it  as  busy  work  or  disconnected  from everything  else,  then  they  are  unlikely  to  learn  anything  from  such  an activity.

## The Self-Directed Learning Project

If you can find the time, there is also the opportunity to provide opportunity for students to create their own learning agenda. I found great success with a  simple  template  that  I  have  used  with  college  students,  and  others  are using it with students in elementary school, middle school, and high school. The template simply includes a series of questions.

## What is my driving question? What is the question that will drive my inquiry?

Invite students to pick something that is personally compelling, something that matters to them. This can be a single question, but it is one of the more important parts of the project. If it is not a question with which a student resonates, then it will be much harder for the student to get immersed in the project.  Many  teachers  find  that  it  is  useful  to  facilitate  activities  and exercises where students study great questions and inquires from the past, perhaps from students in other schools. The teacher guides a conversation about  what  sorts  of  questions  are  more  powerful  and  provocative  than others. As such, this is not just about writing down a question and moving on.  Students  can  benefit  from  grappling  with  and  workshopping  their questions with classmates over days or maybe even a couple of weeks in some cases. Getting the right question will go a long way for making the project a success .

How will I pursue answers to this question?

This might include readings, ideas for field trips, experiments, interviews, new  experiences,  research,  a  review  of  research,  building  a  personal learning network related to their question, or perhaps joining one or more online  communities.  Students  get  to  decide  upon  the  learning  journey  in many ways, but as with framing the question, this is something that benefits from small and large group exploration and discussion. Students can learn from curated resources and one another as they consider the best and most useful  ways  to  go  about  exploring  their  questions.  Remember  that  this  is going to be new for many students at first, so it will take them time to learn how to do this well.

## How will I document &amp; reflect on my learning journey?

I often suggest that this should be in a form that the teacher can review at any  point  in  the  journey.  It  gives  the  teacher  a  chance  to  monitor  the student's learning. I usually ask students to update it at least twice a week. Sometimes  the  platform  is  selected  by  the  teacher,  like  in  a  designated Google document that the student shares with the teacher. In other cases, students may have the choice on where and how they do this. It might be a shared online document, a blog, a video diary, or maybe so other creative but reflective expressing of their learning and progress.

## What culminating product(s)/project(s)/performance(s) will be the result of my work?

Possibilities include but are not limited to papers, presentations to different audiences, models, photo journals, events that you plan and host, things that students  design  or  create,  or  anything  else  that  provides  evidence  of learning. In addition to answering this question, students have the challenge of communicating what they learned as a result of this project, project, or performance .

## How will I monitor my progress and get feedback on my progress throughout the project?

One possibility is to have peers, teachers, or experts frequently review and give feedback based on what students are sharing. Students may also want to schedule 'checkup' meetings with people who can help give feedback, including  the  teacher.  Instead  of  the  teacher  setting  all  of  this  up  for  the students,  it  is  powerful  when  students  learn  to  plan  their  own  feedback systems, albeit with help from peers and the teacher as a coach.

## What is the tentative timeline for this project?

There are usually certain parameters set by the school or teacher. It might be a four to six week project. It could also be a semester or longer. Many students benefit from working within some set of parameters or structure, but  this  is  also  a  great  chance  for  students  to  learn  time  management  by planning and setting at least some of the benchmarks along the way. Yet, even  in  some  of  the  more  self-directed  schools,  I  often  see  teacherdedicated  checkpoints  as  often  as  two  or  three  times  a  week,  or  as infrequent  as  once  every  week  or  two.  Especially  as  students  are  just beginning to direct their own learning, a few parameters keep the student from falling into that dangerous trap of procrastinating on everything until the last week or two.

## What are some key resources to get started?

While an earlier question asked students to begin to identify some of the resources  and  activities  that  will  be  used  during  the  project,  I  found  it helpful to also invite them to start with a few starting points. As they work through these, they will likely come up with new ideas that help them move forward and refine their work. These starting resources might include a key person to interview, a core text, or a few select articles. While students are doing much of this work on their own, the teacher and others can offer tips and guidance on where to go and how to decide upon these initial resources

.

## How will this project connect with one or more key standards or learning outcomes?

This last question is usually important in more traditional school contexts. There are usually certain standards that need to be met or focused upon in a class. As such, this last question give students a chance to align with they want to learn with what they need to learn based upon the standard. Yet, this is also a place where the teacher might find a need to contribute something.

## What is the role of the teacher?

At  this  point  in  the  text,  it  should  be  apparent  that  a  move  toward  selfdirected  learning  is  not  necessarily  a  decrease  in  work  for  the  teacher. Rather, it is a change in the nature of work. The teacher becomes a coach, mentor, and learning experience designer. The  teacher is constantly observing,  being  deeply  curious  about  the  students,  what  is  working,  and what  is  not  working.  The  teacher  is  helping  to  facilitate  thought  and student-to-student  interaction  that  empowers  student  voice  and  deepens their learning journey.

The goal is for students to become increasingly independent, but selfdirected  learning  is  not  about  solitary  learning.  Similarly,  while  selfdirected  learning  is  about  learners  becoming  increasingly  independent,  it does not necessarily suggest independent  learning. It can be highly interdependent,  collaborative,  and  cooperative.  Furthermore,  the  reality  is that learners in a given context will likely have varying levels of competence and confidence with self-direction, especially those who spent years  in  a  learning  context  that  was  dominated  by  a  teacher-directed approach to learning.

Even  for  students  with  significant  confidence,  a  self-directed  learning approach does not devalue the role of experts, mentors, coaches and guides. Self-directed  learning  is  more  about  how  people  learn,  and  about  how  to create an environment where that learning can flourish. It elevates the role of the learner, recognizes that learning happens when the individual learner takes ownership for her own learning .

A  teacher/mentor  can  play  a  valuable  role  as  one  engages  in  selfdirected  learning.  Roger  Hiemstra,  a  scholar  of  adult  learning  and  selfdirected learning, addressed  this question  in 'Self-Directed  Learning: Individualizing  Instruction-  Most  Still  Do  It  Wrong!'  In  his  essay,  he proposes six roles of the teacher: content resource, resource locator, interest stimulator, positive attitude generator, creativity and critical thinking stimulator, and evaluation stimulator. 35 In other words, the teacher helps to cultivate  an  environment  that  is  conducive  to  self-directed  learning,  and provides assistance for individuals and groups of learners. As drawn from Hiemstra's six roles, following is a short reflection on each of them. These provide a sense of the types of thoughts and actions that occupy a teacher's time in an increasingly self-directed environment. As you can see, this is far from a hands-off role.

## Content Resource and Content Locator

The  teacher  helps  to  make  accessible  and  available  rich  content  and resources that will benefit individual learners. This content might be digital, traditional texts, artifacts, experiential, help coordinating visits and interviews, or it might simply be conversational (content acquired through dialogue with the teacher, peers or others). This role of teacher as content resource and resource locator is also sometimes referred to as a curator of content. Of course, as students become  increasingly competent and confident, they will also take on this role in growing measure.

## Interest Stimulator and Positive Attitude Generator

The  teacher  aids  the  learner  as  she  grows  in  confidence  and  competence with  information  and  research  literacy.  Googling  an  idea  may  be  helpful, but there are many other valuable ways to explore a topic. The teacher can help  learners  develop  these  skills  in  many  ways,  including  coordinating opportunities  for  learners  to  share  and  guide  one  another  (peer-to-peer learning) .

## Critical Thinking Stimulator

The teacher provides guidance and outlets for critical thinking, brainstorming, and various types of creative thinking. Hiemstra talks about this in terms of helping learners engage in outlets that help with critical and creative  thinking  (different  forms  of  journaling,  reflective  writing  for  an audience as may occur with blogging or contributing to a wiki, engaging in small group discussions, workshopping, etc.). I also see opportunity for the teacher  to  offer  opportunities  for  learners  to  explore  specific  mind  tools (things like the SCAMPER approach to creative thinking).  36

## Evaluation Stimulator

The teacher helps the learner to engage in an evaluative process, assisting the learner as he identifies ways to check his progress toward certain goals, and establishes ways to evaluate the benefits and limitations of his work. This can start with feedback as each learner produces a learning contract. Yet  again,  over  time,  there  is  greater  opportunity  for  students  to  play increasing roles in this evaluative process. Note that the role of evaluation stimulator  is  not  evaluator.  It  is  about  prompting  evaluation,  helping  the learners to take on this role for themselves as much as is possible in your learning context .

## Other Roles

Hiemstra also describes the teacher as having a helpful role with regard to the social, emotional, and psychological aspects of the learner experience; offering experiences  that might  aid with motivation  and  confidencebuilding, for example.  37

Note that all of this can be done without turning the environment back into a teacher-directed experience. The teacher is not doing these things to or for a  learner,  but  providing  guidance  and  help  as  the  learner  does  them. Consider, for example, the role of a librarian. It is not usually the role of the librarian  to  decide  the  research  topic,  conduct  the  research,  or  even  to formally  evaluate  the  work  of  the  patron.  However,  a  great  reference librarian is a tremendous guide and resource. I am not suggesting that the role  of  teacher  and  librarian  are  the  same  in  a  self-directed  learning environment,  but  there  are  at  least  a  few  similarities.  The  teacher  who  is devoted  to  these  tasks  will  have  more  than  enough  good  and  important work to do. The main focus is simply upon being a guide as students grow in their capacity for self-directed learning.

Of  course,  as  we  consider  throughout  this  text,  we  can  think  of  selfdirected learning on a spectrum. In some environments, the teacher might also play some of the more traditional roles. In other contexts, the teacher is striving  to  hand  off  as  much  responsibility  as  possible  to  the  students.  In either  of  these  situations,  however,  the  types  of  roles  described  in  this section  will  usually  need  to  be  fulfilled  by  someone  if  we  want  to  see success. This is especially true when we are first building a culture of selfdirected learning in the classroom.

## The Self-blending Friendly School is the Distributed School

So  far  in  this chapter,  we  explored  becoming  a  self-blended-friendly classroom. What about the even larger picture? How do you become a selfblended-friendly  school?  In  some  ways,  the  classroom  is  much  easier because  all  it  really  takes  is  one  teacher  committed  to  working  with  a willing group of students in that classroom. You can can start to embrace personal  learning  networks.  You  can  start  to  do  personalized  learning projects that are an extensions and different ways of thinking about research projects that have been used for years and years in classrooms. You can do them in small and significant ways for the students. Yet, what if you want to become a more self-directed learning school? What does that take?

## Getting Informed and Clarifying Mission

The  first steps involve getting informed about the possibilities and developing a shared mission. This idea is hard for some to imagine until they  see  it  in  action.  Watching  some  good  video  examples  are  a  starting point,  but  nothing  replaces  finding  a  way  to  visit  classrooms  and  schools that are more self-directed. Interview teachers, founders, students, parents, and others can be incredibly enlightening, and I find this to be one of the fastest ways to work through common concerns and misconceptions. Yet, as the possibilities become more evident to the community, then it is time to come together  and  decide  how  these  examples  can  and  will  inform  what happens in the school.

If  you  do  not  have  the  leaders  and  the  teachers  on  board  with  this,  a shared  vision  or  mission  for  where  you  are  going,  you  can  wander aimlessly.  The  same  thing  is  true  in  the  world  of  educational  technology. Educational technology without a compelling mission and vision, without a compelling reason, is just chasing shiny objects.

I  remember  hearing  a  story  about  how  you  can  catch  a  raccoon.  It sounds like a cruel kind of trap, and I am not sure if it actually works. I have been told it does. You take an old log and drill a hole in it, just smaller than the size of a raccoon's fist. Then you can take a couple of nails and put them in at an angle on the sides of the hole. Finally, you take a shiny coin or object, and you put it in hole. Supposedly, the raccoon will see that shiny object,  reach  down,  grab  the  coin,  and  try  to  pull  it  out.  Yet,  the  fist clenched  around  the  object  along  with  the  nails  makes  it  a  trap  for  the raccoon. All the raccoon has to do to escape is just let go of the coin. Yet, the  raccoon  refuses  to  do  this.  It  will  just  hold  on  to  this  shiny  object. Which goal is more important: your life or holding on to a shiny coin?

The same thing can actually happen in schools as well, if you are just chasing the next shiny trend or innovation, including self-blended and selfdirected  learning,  it  can  be  a  trap,  preventing  you  from  achieving  your mission. If you do not have a compelling mission, you do not know how to prioritize opportunities. You can get trapped, running into more than a few problems along the way.

This is why we need to have deep, substantive conversations with all the key stakeholders. Explore together the definition of self-directed learning, why we are doing this, why it matters for our students, and make your own list of questions. Do not give up until you have all relentlessly explored and found meaningful answers to those questions, until you have a shared vision for what you want to do and why you want to do it.

You do not need to have everything perfectly figured out, but if you can have that clear mission and a clear set of values that are going drive what you  do  and  why  you  do  it,  then  you  are  setting  your  community  up  for success.

## Experimentation

The next step is to start  building  a  culture  of  experimentation.  You  don't just  become a self-directed learning school. This is culture that you build over time, and it calls for humility and experimentation. You will not get everything  right  the  first  time.  There  will  be  confusion  and  challenges. People want to be prepared for this reality, having a culture that tolerates, even embraces such a reality.

There  are  certainly  models  where  you  can  take  what  worked  in  one school  and  try  to  plop  it  into  another  school,  but  usually,  the  culture  is different, and it does not work as you expected. You can use some of the same basic operating principles, but other parts need to be co-created within your school. This allows you to co-create something that is designed upon the uniqueness of your school .

## The Student Role

Start with  the  role  of  the  learners.  If  self-directed  learning  is  about equipping  students  for  having  greater  agency,  voice,  and  choice;  about preparing them to be independent and interdependent citizens; then we are wise to start thinking about the role of students in the community. How can they play a role in co-creating this new culture? How can they be involved in  planning,  key  decisions,  monitoring  the  progress,  and  so  much  more? This  is  intimidating  for  some  school  leaders  who  are  used  to  directing students  more  than  involving  them,  but  making  this  shift  early  in  the process is one of the fastest ways to make progress. It might be awkward and somewhat messy at times, but if we can agree to affirm the insights and leadership  of  students  in  shaping  their  own  learning  community,  then  we know that we are going in the right direction.

## Monitoring Progress

In my study of high-impact learning organizations, I consistently find that the most innovative and impactful organizations are addicted to monitoring how  they  are  doing.  This  is  something  that  people  are  constantly  doing. They  do  it  daily,  weekly,  monthly,  quarterly,  and  annually.  They  seek insights  from  parents,  students,  teachers,  and  any  other  stakeholder  who might give them useful input. Sometimes it is more informal data collection through observing and asking questions. In other cases it is more formal or more quantitative. The key is to genuinely seek candid insights about what is working and what is not. Then we work with the community to respond to  the  data  that  we  collect.  Of  course,  this  is  not  just  for  self-directed learning environments. This works for all types of school cultures.

## Analysis of Policies, Processes, and Practices

If  we are talking about an existing school, most of the school is not built around  self-directed  learning.  As  such,  there  are  policies,  processes,  and preferred practices that probably do not support our newly defined mission and values related to self-directed learning. If we do not take steps to work on  collectively  adjusting  these,  then  we  will  find  ourselves  constantly running into the brick walls of resistant policies and practices. Of course, this  might  involve  support  from  board  members,  teachers,  students,  and parents; but it is necessary if we are going to move forward. It might mean revisiting our grading system, our daily schedule, our course requirements, how we measure progress and success, what we reward and celebrate in the school, the curricula, our conduct policies, the silos of distinct classes and subjects, and any number of topics. We do not necessarily need to change all  or  any  of  these  overnight,  but  we  must  be  aware  of  how  each  of  this support or detract from our goal of being a self-directed learning friendly school. Then we need to come together to discuss how we will respond. If we do not engage in this  important  work,  any  school-wide  effort  in  selfdirected learning is likely to diminish over time. We are trying to pour new wine in old wineskins, and all that does is create an impending mess.

## Concluding Thoughts about Becoming Self-Directed Learning Friendly

There  are  countless  ways  to  move  forward.  The  inspired  teacher  can  get started  today.  You  can  take  small,  daily  steps  toward  investing  in  student agency. Of course, this chapter also gives you a starting point for making larger scale changes in an individual classroom or the larger school. There is  no  one  perfect  way  to  go  about  it.  In  my  study  and  experience,  what matters is having a clear sense of what you want to accomplish and why, to commit  to  this  for  the  long-term  given  the  time  and  experimentation involved, and it invest in building a culture that is conducive to it. You will learn the rest along the way. It is a challenging adventure, but I suspect that, if  you  persist,  you  will  also  join  countless  others  in  saying  that  it  is  well worth it.

36 . SCAMPER is a common mnemonic that stands for substitute, combine, modify, adapt, put to  another  use,  eliminate,  and  reserve.  It  is  a  creative  thinking  tool  that  helps  you  to  look  at problems  or  issues  from  unique  perspectives.  For  example,  if  you  are  thinking  about  reducing pollution, you might draw from the SCAMPER words to ask questions like: What if we combined the idea of reducing pollution with the mechanics of a video game? What if we tried to elimate pollution by creating more products that self-destruct? Or, what if adapted laws to reward people who reduced pollution instead of enforcing laws for people who contributed to it? Of course, not every question is helpful or will lead to a superior solution, but I find this tool to be useful in looking at ideas and issues from fresh perspectives.

## Conclusion

THANK YOU FOR  JOINING  me  on  the  learning  journey  of  going  through  this book  and  exploring  self-directed  learning.  I  am  genuinely  humbled  and grateful that you opted to share a few hours of your life with me to consider these ideas. We started with foundational questions about the definition of self-directed  learning.  We  explored  the  why  of  self-directed  learning.  We examined how this affects access and opportunity. We also reflected on why this connected age calls for such a change in our classrooms and schools. Then we looked at how to overcome common obstacles, and how we can take  specific  steps  to  nurture  self-directed  learning  in  our  classrooms  and schools. I suppose the only thing left is for you to decide if and how you want to join this movement, how you want to start nurturing student agency in your classroom, school, in your family, and in your own life and learning.

As I promised at the beginning of the text, I did not give you a step-bystep guide because I am not convinced that such a guide works, nor do I see it as resonating with the spirit of self-directed learning. You can learn from exemplars and research. You can benchmark from others. You can gather insights  and  input  from  countless  sources.  In  the  end,  it  is  important  to make it your own and to invite those in your learning community to join in co-creating something that matters to that community .

Too  often  in  education,  experts  arise  on  every  possible  topic.  They establish themselves as the guardians of right and wrong practice. There is indeed research to guide our practice that we are wise to consider. At the same time, this is an art as much as it is a science. We are not building a factory.  We are nurturing a community. Experts will want to tell you that you  are  not  doing  true  self-directed  learning,  that  your  light  version  is  a distortion  or  an  abomination.  Still  others  will  tell  you  that  you  are  too extreme. These comments are not as much about what you are doing as they are about these other individual's personal beliefs and values. My advice is to  listen  and  learn  from  these  different  viewpoints  (including  the  ones shared in this book), but to not necessarily follow their advice as if it were some mandate from on high.  You  can  take  it  under  advisement,  but  it  is your learning community's task to experiment and learn together. You are co-creators of the learning community, and I contend that this process of cocreating  is  more  important  than  exactly  how  it  fits  with  current  models elsewhere.  You  are  accountable  to  one  another  and  the  external  key stakeholders (board, community, external agencies, your core convictions, and your moral responsibility in education), and these will certainly inform what you do and how you do it.

You, the learners and other key stakeholders are at an important moment in history. This connected age in which we find ourselves in changing how we live, think, work, play, connect, and learn. The amazing part is that we are  just  at  the  beginning  of  these  changes.  While  we  can  make  informed speculation about what will come next, nobody is certain. What I do know is that the future is not just something that happens to us. We are agents of change, which is why I believe so strongly in nurturing human agency. I see it as  fundamental  to  creating  a  more  humane  learning  ecosystem  and society.  As  Denis  Gabor  wrote,  'Futures  cannot  be  predicted,  but  futures can be created.'  38 If this is true, then I believe that a fundamental need for education in a free society is to equip and empower learners who embrace the challenge and opportunity to be co-creators of our future, and I believe that a growing emphasis upon self-directed learning in our schools can help us  achieve  that.  If  you  agree,  then  I  welcome  you  to  this  wonderful adventure into self-directed learning.
