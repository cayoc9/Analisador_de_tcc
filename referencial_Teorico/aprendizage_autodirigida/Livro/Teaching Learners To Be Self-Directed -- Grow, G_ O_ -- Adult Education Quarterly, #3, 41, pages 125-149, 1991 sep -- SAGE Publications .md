## TEACHING LEARNERS TO BE SELF-DIRECTED

GERALD 0. GROW

## ABSTRACT

Based on the Situational Leadership model of Hersey and Blanchard (1988) the Staged Self-Directed Learning Model proposes that learners advance through stages of increasing self-direction and that teachers can or hinder that development. Good teaching matches the learner's stage of self-direction and the learner advance toward greater self-direction \_ Specific methods are proposed for teaching students at each stage, although many different teaching styles are when appropriately applied.  Several pedagogical difficulties are ex plained as mismatches between teacher style and learner stage, especially the mismatch between a student needing direction and a non-directive teacher. help good

When I began teaching college in the late 1960s, many of my students were teachers taking classes for re-certification. It never occurred to me that I was practicing adult   education. But learned differently than younger students so much more personally and willingly; and with so much independencethat taught me new ways to teach. The first and hardest lesson took about a year: to shut up and listen. Inspired by the possibilities, I sought out educators in the San Francisco area with similar interests and joined them in workshops; retreats; and study groups to learn what we called wrote a manifesto on published in a teacher education journal. they they

After  fifteen years   outside   academia, I returned to the   college classroom teaching magazine journalism to adults-to-be at a state university. Only now students responded differently; Many were passive and dependent upon taught. Others resisted what I had   thought were learnercentered methods of teaching: A few became defiant, or defiantly indifferent. The response of one me to rethink what I knew about teaching: being

I had received the usual range of student responses, from like to dislike and everything in between. But no one had ever hated me. No matter how nice I was, no matter how much interest [ showed in her own learning process; she simply hated me. was too unnerved to find a constructive

response. I couldn't get her to talk to me. Colleagues could not help me understand what was happening or what to do. (Some thought I must be a bad teacher to be admitting such problems.) Since her hatred symbolized other lesser failures to reach other students, I knew then that I would have to learn to teach differently -or leave.

This paper presents model, the Staged Self-Directed Learning (SSDL) Model, that suggests how teachers can actively equip students to become more self-directed in their learning. Although the model may apply to less formal learning situations; it is directed to teachers; expressed in terms of 'teachers" and 'students;' and was devised with educational institutions in mind.

While struggling with this problem, I found a concept around which to organize   my observations: Students   have   varying abilities   to respond to teaching that requires them to be self-directing: The main outlines of this paper emerged in 1987 as series of diagrams and teaching practices. Only later did I have the opportunity to begin a literature review. That search uncovered few articles specifically addressing the question of how to teach students with varying degrees of self-direction; but it introduced me to the basic literature on adult education; which contains some of the most exciting thinking about teaching that I have encountered. The search confirmed that others considered this line of thought important. Indeed, nearly every in this article has been stated elsewhere; for example, in Mezirows urging that "enhancing the learners ability for self direction in learning [is] a dation for a distinctive philosophy of adult education? (1981, p. 21) Reading the dissertations by Candy (1987) and Gerstner (1987) was particularly exhilerating and humbling: point foun-

## THE MODEL

As its starting point; the SSDL model borrows several concepts from the Situational Leadership Model of Paul Hersey and Kenneth Blanchard. One of the Leadership is described in full in their classic work, The Management of Organizational Behavior (1988). Hersey and Blanchard argue that management (and, by extension; teaching) is situational: The style of management should be matched to the employees "readiness. Readiness, a combination from 'not able? and 'not willing Or motivated? to do the at  hand. Readiness   is situational   and it may even be task specific. (A salesperson may be at selling; yet "able but unmotivated" to complete the necessary paperwork:) A manager chooses a mix of directiveness and personal interaction 'socioemotional support?) that accomplishes two First; it matches the employees readiness so that the task at hand can be accomplished. Second, it helps move the employee toward more self-managing: There is no one way to manage everyone; yet key good good things. being good

everyone can be managed in such a way that increase in the ability to be more self-managing they

Situational Leadership has wide following among managers in business and education, but studies of its effectiveness are inconclusive and it has critics and competitors. Nicholls (1985) claims that the model suffers from fundamental but   like   several other   critics, offers an only   slightly revised version of Situational Leadership to replace it. Blake and Mouton's Managerial Grid (1964) advocates a team approach as a way to maximize both productivity and personal development; claiming; in effect; that there is single best way to manage. Both models Managerial Grid and Situational Leadership have  attempted to subsume one another and the debate between them is not over flaws,

The idea of a progression from dependency to self-direction is not unique to Situational Leadership. A movement of that kind is often presumed to be part of maturing into adulthood (e.g Knowles; 1980). Erickson and others have charted life as a series of stages that have the same tendency. The seminal article on how leaders can assist this progression is Tannenbaum and Schmidts (1957) description of a leadership  continuum; which influenced the Situational Leadership model and is reflected in several articles in adult education. For example, Millar et al. (1986) use Tannenbaum and Schmidts model, and Pratt (1988) employs some of their terminology to explore the roles teachers   should take with students who have differing degrees of self-direction:

In developing this paper, I have become aware of holding certain assump tions, which I state here:

- 1 The of the educational process is to produce self-directed, lifelong learners. Many current educational practices in public schools and univer sities; however, do more to perpetuate dependency than to create self-direction. goal
- teaching is situational\_it varies in response to the learners. good
- 4. Self-direction is advantageous in many settings and this model is built upon a strong belief in its value but there is nothing inherently wrong with dependent learner, whether that dependency is temporary or permanent, limited to certain subjects or extending to all. being
- 3. The ability to be self-directed is situational in that one may be selfdirected in one subject, a dependent learner in another. Self-direction; however, is not entirely situational; it is partly a personal  trait   analogous to maturity; Once developed, certain aspects of self-direction are transferrable to new situations.
- 5.Just as dependency and helplessness can be learned, self-direction can be learned and it can be taught.

Brookfield (1984; 1985; 1986), Candy (1987), and Gerstner (1987) have devoted more than a thousand pages to analyzing the meaning(s) of self-

remains the North Star of adult education. Few people have ever defined self-directed learning with precision; nonetheless; self-directed learning is an immensely useful concept for orienting oneself to education at all levels.

Faced with a concept like self-directed learning, one can either conclude that it appears messy merely because it has been inadequately defined, or one can realize that beneath all of our indispensable labels for basic human sthought; munication'") lie the roots of a similar complexity. The idea of self-directed learning continues to fascinate partly because it embraces s0 many credible inconsistencies. It sounds like people we know. And even though the fundamental terms have widely come into question "learning; and what 'education? has to do with all this (see Gerstner [1987], especially) ~no other concept has superseded self-directed learning as a working idea.

Some features of self-direction are distinctly situational: Few learners are equally motivated toward all subjects. Some features appear to be familial, perhaps even genetic traits of individual personalities ~ such as persistence. Self-directed learning is a candidate for what the great tive psychologist Vygotsky called a 'higher mental function? Or a 'tool of over time through a particular history of social interaction; which can operate in any situation. Parts of self-directed learning develop before the whole; yet the components do not necessarily combine (to paraphrase   Vygotsky) into a constellated develop best in nurturing environments while others are nearly impossible to suppress. Some develop as the peak of Maslows pyramid of needs; others are so essential to survival that emerge almost before the self. deep, good cogni unity they

Candy (1987)   usefully distinguished  three meanings  of the term 'selfdirected learning?: autonomy as a personal quality; autodidaxy as learning outside formal instruction; and learner-control (along with teacher-control) as an essential consideration of formal instruction. In those terms, this article uses 'self-directed learning" to refer to the degree of choice that learners have within an instructional situation: I would almost be happy to adopt the term &lt;learner control; except that highly self-directed learners sometimes choose highly directive teachers. In this paper, &lt;self-direction" retains some of its aura of undefined possibilities and appears as the openself-directed learning theory; it is about teaching: Specifically; it proposes way teachers can be vigorously influential while empowering students toward greater autonomy. Figure 1 introduces the four stages of the SSDL model, which were inspired by the four leadership styles described in Situational Leadership.

The teacher's   purpose is to match the learners stage of self-direction and prepare the learner to advance to higher stages.

Dependent learners need an authority-figure to give them explicit directions on what to how to do it; and when. For these students, learning is teacher-centered. either treat teachers as experts who know what the student needs to do, or passively slide through the educational system; responding mainly to teachers who make" them learn. Some learners are dependent in all subjects are "taught;" others are dependent only in some subjects. Some dependent learners become excellent students within a specialized area; can be systematic, thorough, and disciplined, master a settled subject or transmitting a fixed tradition. Some learners are enduringly dependent; others are temporarily teacher-dependent because, in Pratts terms, lack either relevant knowledge; skills; and experience or the motivation and self-confidence to pursue educational (1988, p. 168) do, They they they they ing "they goals"

a dependent learner is not a defect; it can, however, be a serious limitation. All learners of whatever stage may become temporarily dependent in the face of new topics. For example, learners of other stages may freely choose to learn in a dependent mode for efficiency or to access to a certain teacher. Being gain

Teaching Stage 1 Learners: Coaching: There are at least two ways to approach the teaching of dependent learners through coaching and through insight. To use the coaching method, you must first establish your credibility and authority. In this stage, the teacher is an expert whose mastery must be real. Dependent learners respond best to a clearly-organized, rigorous ap techniques for achieving them. Many students at this stage expect discipline and direction, s0 provide it.

Avoid giving choices to S1 learners. Keep your communication clear and thorough, but mainly one-way. Instruction does not have to be impersonal, but the focus should be on the subjectnot on the learners. Grading must be unequivocal objective, and cleanly related to the task at hand. Feedback should be immediate, frequent; task-oriented, and as impartial as possible.

Some Stage 1 learners test their teachers; s0 decide in advance how you will answer overt or veiled challenges to your authority. Organize the course clearly with rigorous assignments  and definite deadlines. busy learning specific; identifiable skills. Set standards beyond what students think can do, then do whatever is necessary to get them to succeed. Create and reward successMany   well established behavioral teaching methods work well in the Sl stage. Keep they

Teacher expertise and effectiveness are the key in dealing with the dependent learner. Don't be too nice about it. If you are, may dismiss you as soft, try to take advantage of you; or into self-defeating habits of non-learning   Many   learners at this   stage of   development depend on teachers to make decisions be shy about accepting the role. (Many S1 learners respond to gentler, more interactive methods: It is important; however, to be prepared for resistance;) they lapse they

A different approach to teaching Stage 1 learners requires involving them who are and what want tomarily begin this way. Another learner-involvement approach, critical agogy; is derived from the work of Paulo Freire (Freire; 1968; Shor, 1987; Shor &amp; Freire, 1987). Teachers in this   approach lead students to take responsibility for their own learning especially by confronting the ways are held back by society and by themselves.  Although insight methods are they they pedthey of the characteristics of   Stage 1 teachers sound terrible to proponents of student-centered styles of teaching; Fox (1983), for example, criticizes this method as the "transfer" theory of teaching, where teachers pour knowledge into students. Freire (1968) calls it the "banking" approach. Stage 1 teaching can be limiting and even punative; the SSDL theory proposes, however, that Stage 1 teaching is bad only when it is to the students or used to perpetuate dependency. Learning in a dependent mode goes against the of progressive, humanistic; and adult education. as Pratt emphasizes; 'there is nothing inherently demeaning or destructive in pedagogical temporarily dependent, relationships" (1988, p. 168) Many applied wrong grain Yet,

Stage 1 teaching seems to be rejected by many writers on education; but it has tremendous popular appeal. People who want to go 'back to the basics" usually want to there in Stage 1 classrooms. A successful Stage 1 teacher can be seen in the film, Stand and Deliver. pushes, and cajoles a group of disenchanted underachievers until learn calculus almost to spite him. Then he lifts their self-esteem with the realiza tion that did it, and can do it He prepares them (as a Stage 1 teacher must do) for higher levels of achievement and self-direction. Another example of a Stage 1 teacher appears in the film, Lean On Me, where a strong father-figure with an authoritarian style revives a high school that had gone out of control. But like most admirers of Stage 1 methods; the makers of this film do not ask how students progress to greater autonomy and responsibility. get they they they again. good

Learners at this stage go if understand why and the instructor provides direction and help. Or will go along because like the teacher. Learners at this stage respond positively to personal interaction from the teacher, something not always true of S1 learners. To teach at this stage, give clear explanations of why the skills  are important and how the assignments help attain them. Show concrete results in what their own.

Because part of the function of a Stage 2 teacher is to prepare students to become more self-directing; it is important at this stage to begin training students in such basic skills as setting: Use praise, but with an eye to phasing out praise  (extrinsic motivation)   and phasing in encouragement (which builds intrinsic motivation)   (Dinkmeyer &amp; Losoncy; 1980).

Examples of Stage 2 teaching include a lecturer as inspiring performer, industry training programs, teacher-led discussion; demonstration by an exfollowed by guided practice; structured projects with predictable outcomputerized drill; structured projects of commercial art and design studios (Foxs example), and a mother teaching a child to talk. These examples involve the combination of two elements: strong personal interaction and strong focus on subject matter. pert

Communication is two-way. The teacher explains and justifies each ment and   persuades   students of  its value. Students communicate their responses and interests. A Stage 2 teacher ties the subject to the Stage 2 teacher resembles Foxs (1983) "shaper" \_ the teacher who &lt;views students, or at least student brains, as raw material (metal, wood, or clay) to be shaped, or molded, or turned to predetermined  and often detailed specification? 153). Typical of innovative   educators;   however, Fox devalues the Stage 2 teacher and promotes other, less-directive teaching styles The SSDL model proposes that this teaching style may be the best way to teach learners who are at the S2 stage (in relation to the specific subject matter to be learned), s0 one should be prepared to use it without apology. assign good

The Robin Williams character in Dead Poets Society is an example of the Stage 2 teacher as lecturer-performer. He challenges a jaded but accessible group of boys to become excited about poetry. His methods are theatrical in that he is a master performer when he lectures. He also requires them to become involved, to stand before the class and recite their own work, to take risks. Interestingly; in response to his encouragement, move to a version of Stage 3: form their own poetry group. Notice that their self-direction is situational: do not also form geography group Or become more self-directing in the ability to talk to their fathers. they They They

Shirley MacLaine; in the film, Madame Sousatzka, shows a different kind of Stage 2 teacher who drives; goads; cajoles, inspires; woos, critiques, and dominates the developing student (incorporating many Stage 1 methods). The poignancy of this film derives from the fact that her best pupils must and do outgrow her and move on to less-directive teachers.

## Stage 3: Learners of Intermediate Self-Direction

In this stage, learners have skill and knowledge, and see themselves as participants in their own education. are ready to explore a subject with a guide: will even explore some of it on their own. But may need to develop a deeper self-concept, more confidence, more sense of direction; and a greater ability to work with (and learn from) others. Stage 3 learners  will  benefit from learning more about how they learn; such as conscious use of learning strategies (Derry; 1988/89). they They good They they making

Stage 3 college students see themselves as future equals of the teacher; as professionals or worthwhile adults in the making; but may not be experienced or motivated enough to continue on their own. want to be involved with teachers and other learners and to be respected for who are and what can do. 3 learners work well with the teacher and with each other in the design and implementation of learning projects: Stu dents can learn collaboratively at any stage, but students who are ready for Stage 3 learning can accomplish far more together than students in earlier stages: Stage 3 can be an exciting phase, and many students don't want to leave it. are happy working in the warm interaction of a friendly group.

They learn to value the personal experiences of others. They develop critical thinking; individual initiative; and a sense of themselves as co-creators of the culture that shapes them. This may involve a therapy-like shift of a personal paradigm ~a 'perspective transformation" (Mezirow, 1981) Or 'life-world transformation?

Examples of Stage 3 include a seminar with instructor as participant, student group projects approved and facilitated (but not directed) by the into open-ended,  student-developed group projects formed without close supervision. per-

As students mature toward greater self-direction; the Stage 3 teacher will help them structure the transition toward independence. The 'facilitator" might begin by negotiating interim and interim evaluations; and then give learners more rope. Standards at this level are not the teacher's; are negotiated with the student and often related to some external standard, such as professional accreditation requirements. Stage 3 learners can be assigned to work in groups on open-ended but carefully-designed projects. Written criteria, learning contracts; and evaluation checklists help learners monitor their own progress.

Examples of Stage 3 models are humanistic education; humanistic group therapies; critical pedagogy as described in Shor (1987), collaborative learndevelop students' own motivation rather than provide that motivation; and andragogical adult education.

Learners at this stage are both able and willing to take responsibility and productivity. exercise skills in time que, information gathering, and use of educational resources. The most mature Stage 4 learners can learn from any kind of teacher, but most 4 learners thrive in an atmosphere of autonomy: Some learners become situationally  self-directed while some become self-directed in a more general sense. Interestingly, Stage 4 learning does not completely do away with teachers. As Candy (1987) puts it, &lt;There are certain skills and other bodies of knowledge which are best and most easily mastered under the tutelage of an expert" (p. 229). for They Stage

Teaching 4 Learners: now complete from the subject-matter focus of the earliest stages to the learner-focus of Stage 4. The Stage 4 teacher's role is not to teach subject matter but to cultivate the students ability to learn. The ultimate subject of Stage 4 is the learner's own personal   empowerment. The teacher may: Consult with learners to develop written criteria, an evaluation checklist; a timetable, and management chart for each project they develop; Hold regular meetings so students can chart and discuss everyones progress and discuss problems; Encourage students to cooperate and consult with each other, but not to abandon responsibility; Focus on the process of productive; as well as the product; Work on more advanced projects with clear meaning outside career Or through stages such as intern; apprentice; journeyman; master, and mentor; in speakers who represent each stage in such a journey.

There are other S4 roles besides delegating  Another S4 teacher might inspire and mentor. Another might challenge or provoke the learner, then back. Another might become the externalized professional conscience detail but ensuring that the learner internalizes those functions thoroughly. (S4 learners sometimes need the enlightened reapplication of S1 methods) Another might plant concepts; questions; or paradoxes in the learner's mind which require a lifetime to work through. Fully self-directed learning is not possible in an institutional setting and the SSDL model does not require an institutional setting: Rather, self-directed, lifelong adult learning is offered here as the single most important outcome of a formal education. step

There is clearly more than one way to be a good Stage 4 teacher. The Situational Leadership model which assumes an organizational setting in which the manager is trying to produce self-managing subordinates, advocates a psychological maturity of Stage 4 students, the instructor gradually reduces both two-way communication and external reinforcement. As enjoyable as it is to interact with such advanced learners, such teacher will fade back; so that the learner's own efforts become the unequivocal focus. The relationship between teacher and student is collegial and distinctly not intense; instead the relationship is high between students and world, students and task; and perhaps among students. The teacher actively monitors progress to ensure success, but steps in only to assist students in acquiring the skills to be self-directing and self-monitoring: The teacher weans the student of taught. being

In Stage 4 the learner may not need a teacher at all. A Stage 4 teacher might set a challenge; then leave the learner largely alone to carry it out; intervening only when asked to help-and then not help meet the challenge, but instead help empower the learner to meet the challenge. Castaneda's Don Juan; Gandhi; and Joseph Campbell are possible models. Judging from the Tao Te Lao Tzu must have been one of the ultimate Stage 4 teachers. Some Stage 4 teachers; like the Sufi master Ajnabi, teach invisibly: 'Nobody ever knew what were learning, because he made them posses Sors of learning in a manner which prevented them from prizing learning: generally thought that were part in some completely irrelevant activity"' (Shah, 1970, p. 22) Ching they7 taking They they

## IMPLICATIONS FOR TEACHING

## Mismatch between Teaching Styles and Learning Stages

Problems arise when the teaching style is not matched to the learner's degree of self-direction Figure 2 represents one of the most important out comes of the SSDL model. Out of the of 16 possible pairings between teaching styles and learning stages, six pairings are mismatches, and two of those are severe. grid

The TIIS4 Mismatch. When Stage 4 self-directed students are with Stage 1 authoritarian teacher (referred to here as T1) problems may arise. Some S4 learners develop the ability to function well and retain overall conlearners will resent the authoritarian teacher and rebel against the barrage paired

Verner (1962) believed that teaching method must be matched to subject matter, and he mapped student "participation" (similar to the dependent-independent dimension in this theory) against subject matter (ranging from abstract to experiential) . The present theory presses toward a different conclusion; and, while I have some doubts about this conclusion; here it is: The SSDL approach is independent of subject matter. Teaching style should be governed not by subject matter but by the balance between teacher directiveness and student control, usually set by the student's ability to participate as self-directed,   self-motivated   responsible   learner though sometimes negotiated between teacher and student (such as when students capable of self-direction choose a directive teacher).

The most severe problems occur when dependent learners are mismatched with and when   self-directed learners are mismatched with directive teachers.

To make worse, the Sl teacher will probably not interpret such a rebellion as the result of mismatch; the teacher is likely to see the student as 'surly, uncooperative and unprepared to get down to the hard craft of learning basic facts" (Fox; 1983, p: 160).

Older   adults returning for graduate are often taught by briskly directive faculty the S1 mode (Lewis, 1990). The S3 mode is sometimes not used with older learners, even when it is possible and appropriate; simply because teachers lack experience in this type of teaching: Mature students may respond like the disgruntled in a recent New who   complained, 'Heel never 'Think, 'Innovate; 'Be yourself (Steiner, 1990) they using doing they having They using dog 'Stay;

structure, the followers tend to see this action as punative rather than helping relationship. (P. 4)

Several  telling examples of this kind of mismatch can be found in the reports of innovative teaching in Rogers (1983). One student; whose ability to respond with self-direction was less than that demanded by the course, wrote:

Iam the product of a system built around assignments, deadlines, and conventional examinations. Therefore, with this course graded by the flexible method and four other courses graded by the more conventional methods I tend to give less attention to this course than it merits due to lack of well-defined requirements. (Rogers, 1983, P. 91)

In another section, Rogers acknowledges "the shock and resentment that sometimes occur when   students are faced with responsible choices" (p: 93). Other teachers in the book blame such students for not taking responsibility for their own learning, concluding that in dependent learners "old conditioning feels safe and operates well" (p. 66). The have no pedagogical method for helping students move from dependency to self-direction. That is what the Staged Self-Directed Learning Model proposes. they

## Discussion of Mismatches

The T4/S1 mismatch (or the milder mismatch of T4/S2) points to a fundamental  problem with the extreme 'free school" approach to education (practiced by Neill [1960] and attempted by many). This  approach trusts that, left   alone; children will learn on their own\_ Theliterature on selfdirected learning; however; suggests that "learning on your requires a complex collection of self-skills and learning skills which not all learners spontaneously acquire. Unless self-direction is explicitly encouraged, "free" schools and vopen" programs may work only for those whose family background has already prepared them for self-direction (Tuman, 1988) own?

Teachers critical pedagogy have also reported difficulties when the method does not match the learning stage of the student. Even though critical pedagogy is specifically designed to address the learning problems of students in their real situations (including the classroom) some students do not respond. 'Most of my mainstream students. are waiting for the teacher to speak and do all the work and leave them alone to copy down what should be memorized; Ira Shor reported. generally begin sively alienated, and many stay that way until the end' (Shor &amp; Freire, 1987, p. 129). For all its virtues, critical pedagogy alone may not be sufficient to move students from dependent to independent learning: The SSDL model suggests that problems may arise when the S3 approach of critical pedagogy conflicts with the need Sl students have for taught. using college uThey being

Though adult educators recognize that adult learners are not necessarily self-directed learners, it is widely assumed that   adults will become  selfdirected after a few sessions explaining the concept. (See; for example, Rutland &amp; Guglielminos   [1987]   well-designed program for   teaching adults about   self-directed   learning   before begin self-directed   learning But not all adults will   become   self-directed when told. Adult learners can be at any of the four learning stages, but the literature on adult education is dominated by advocates of what the SSDL model would call a Stage 3 method \_ a facilitative approach emphasizing group work Even teachers of adults; however, may need to approach certain learners in directive, even authoritarian style, then gradually equip those learners with more self-directed manner\_ they

Freire, advocate of a classroom in equal respect, acknowledges the paradoxical need to be directive:

That means   accepting the directive nature of education There is directiveness in education which never allows it to be neutral. role is not to be silent.

What is 'good teaching" for one student in one stage of development may not be 'good teaching? for another student or even for the same student at a different stage of development. Good teaching does two things: It matches the students stage of self-direction; and it empowers the student to progress toward greater self-direction: Good teaching is situational yet it promotes the long-term development of the student:

Good Teaching; The SSDL model suggests why 'good teaching" is widely misunderstood. Most people seem to think that there is one way to teach well. Awards usually go to a teacher who is outstanding in one of the first two stages the one who pours it on" or the one who leads and motivates students less often to the one who encourages students to develop on their own; or the one who engages the most advanced students with openended problems. deep,

In my experience, teachers of the S1-S2 types and teachers of the S3-S4 types have an almost innate antipathy for one another's methods, and often for one another's  personalities.  Humanistic educators (for example; 1983) often   ridicule Or reject S1 and S2 teachers; conversely; often ridicule those consider fuzzy and non-directive. In typical polarizing fashion, each group compares its virtues to the other's faults. Fox they

This split is reminiscent of an old debate in adult education. Teachers of the Sl and S2 types appear more  pedagogical, while teachers of the S3 and S4 types appear more "andragogical; and the two camps readily oppose each another.

The temptation for the Stage 1 teacher is to be authoritarian in a punitive, controlling way that stifles initia tive and creates resistance and dependency: The temptation for the Stage 2 teacher is to remain on center stage, inspiring all who will listen but leaving them with no more learning skills or self-motivation than when began. The Stage 3 teacher can disappear into the group and demoralize students by "accepting and valuing almost anything from anybody" (Fox; 1983, p. 162). The Stage 4 teacher can withdraw too much from the learning experience; lose touch, fail to monitor progress, and let students themsel ves with rope are not accustomed to handling   Alternately, a misguided Stage 4 mentor can insidiously infiltrate all aspects of an advanced they hang they yet

Returning to Figure 2, we can see that there are six areas of significant mismismatches highlights the 10 areas in which teaching style and learner stage are matched Or nearly matched. Those 10 areas; moving in the diagram from lower left diagonally to upper right, constitute an area of workable match - a "learning field" (in a similar figure Hersey [1983] calls it the High Probability Match diagonal)\_ onto which several pedagogical  activities can be usefully mapped.

Paul Hersey; co-author of the Situational Leadership Model, described an experimental course in which students were moved through more dependent roles into self-directed roles (Hersey &amp; Blanchard, 1988). The course began with lectures (delivered in a Stage 1 teaching style), moved to directed discussions (Stage 2) then to less-structured discussions (Stage 3) and finally to student-directed discussions (Stage 4). During the semester, the teacher gradually changed role (see Figure 3) from expert; to guide, to facilitating

participant, to consultant for student-directed activities. Student   roles changed during this time in response to the teacher's role from dependent to participant to student-led learning. Hersey (1988) reported student resistance to moving into Stage 3 and 4 learning (a resistance Millar et aL [1986] discuss in some depth), but found the course to be more successful than a control course taught in the regular way. (As far as I know; no one else has duplicated this basic experiment in staged self-direction) Following this example, the SSDL model can be used to plan a course, so that students move from dependent to more self-directed learning over a semester.

Even a single class meeting could be organized so that students move from dependency, through intermediate stages, to more self-directed The teacher can demonstrate a skill, coach them through using the skill, facilitate their application of it, and then have them work in groups to create new situations in which to practice the skill on each other. On small scale, this progression takes students through the stages of increased self-direction and empowerment as the teacher moves from directive role to one of facilitating and monitoring: learning;

In a similar way; the overall plan for a college curriculum can be mapped into the four boxes highlighted in Figure 3. Introductory college courses match the SI student with Tl and T2 teaching styles. Intermediate courses match S2 students with T1/2/3 teaching styles. Advanced courses match S3 students with T2/3/4 teaching styles. S4 students are matched to graduate courses; internships; independent study, and senior thesis, taught in the T3 and T4 teaching styles. In such a way; the SSDL model might be used as a planning tool for coordinating faculty efforts so that students do, in fact, progress  toward greater self-direction as move to upper-level college courses. they

The SSDL model describes a progression of stages; but the progress of a student or a class will rarely be linear, and most classes will contain students at different stages of self-direction: A realistic, though more complicated, version of the model would be non-linear and iterative. Consider an upper-level college course designed in the S3 model. The teacher serves as group facilitator, with the job of empowering students to take greater of their learning and making certain that master advanced levels of the subject matter. Most of the work of the class takes place in the S3 arena, where the teacher seeks ways to phase out external leadership and empower more  student self-direction. But there other learning modes are necessary (see Figure 4).

At times; individuals or subgroups will become ready to exert self-direction and leadership. Those students can go into the S4 mode, carry out a project independently; then come back to the group group as base, the class can out to the other three stages when are appropriate. point. loop they

In a similar way, a class focussed on another stage of learning; S1 through S4, can draw support from earlier stages and lean toward later stages. Many college courses center around a series of S1/S2 lectures but have a weekly discussion group more in the S3 mode. Looping may be a more effective way to use the SSDL concept than trying to follow a sequence of linear stages. Still, the map provided by the SSDL model identifies the educational terrain we are traversing: The rigid application of this model would, of course; lead to SSDL model helps one stay focused on the task of developing self-direction.

## IMPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCH

Most teaching models imply a theory of education that sharply constrains their validity, and this one might as well. The of training (to perform known tasks well) and education (to develop people who can live in an unpredictable   world) are sufficiently  different  to make one worry that the SSDL model may unwittingly carry the limits of a management model into the much wider arena of education. At what points do management models and education models clash, and how can their differences be reconciled? goals

The SSDL model represents teaching as independent of subject matter. Yet hatha yoga, karate and some other subjects are always taught in the same mode, without regard for the self-direction of the learner: Why isn't the learner's ability to be self-directed an important variable in the teaching of such subjects?

Thats major omission: The models focus on teacher-facilitated learning further limits its usefulness by excluding teacherless learning: Teaching the already-resistant, chronically-dependent learner remains problematic in this model. In life; we often devote ourselves to solving with one hand the very problems we are creating with the other. Is there another way to construe teaching and learning so that some of the SSDLs solutions become unnecessary?

What do teachers do that causes students to feel more directed or more autonomous? If two teachers deliver identical instructions for a learning exercise; will students perceive them as identically directive? What could make difference? How much is directiveness matter of instructional method and how much is it a matter of personal style? The very concept of &lt;directiveness needs to be examined closely.

Teacher expectation may play a greater role than this theory allows.  Will students of all kinds act more self-directed merely because that is what the teacher expects? How well can self-direction be faked? Can self-direction be summoned into by the power of expectation alone, or does it require the separate practice of separate skills? being

This paper has discussed overt teacher directiveness. What about direcand the structures of computer-assisted instruction? What about the subtle directiveness  of an expert   facilitator designer  of educational environments? Do learners relate to hidden directiveness the same way relate to overt directiveness? Does hidden directiveness   promote   dependency more or less than overt directiveness? (Does either promote dependency?) Is there difference in directiveness between a teacher telling the learner what to do and the learner reading a book (or a computer screen) that tells the same thing? they

Like any exploratory theory, this one is based alternately on seasoned observations and plausible guesses. Are there really stages of self-direction or

## TEACHING LEARNERS TO BE SELF-DIRECTED 147

is the Tannenbaum-Schmidt continuum better description of the relation between teacher and learner control? If there are stages, can teachers identify them accurately? Can learners? What marks a learners passage from one stage to another? To what extent are these stages developmental, and to what extent are situational? Would it make sense for each learner to keep a 'checklist" of the subskills of self-direction and the extent those are at work in each area of learning? To what degree can teachers alter their natural teaching styles to accommodate students in different stages? When learner and teacher are mismatched, how do currently handle the situation? What strategies; for example; do mature; self-directed adults use when suddenly   faced with an S1 teacher? Do learners   develop   sequentially through the stages, or are the stages actually modes of learning that can occur in alternation; or even simultaneously; in the same learner? they they

The SSDL model is a powerful concept; and like all powerful concepts, not to be trusted. Onto the many complexities of learning; it imposes a brisk, no-nonsense interpretation. It is valuable in the sense of a bright, singleminded colleague who keeps explaining everything so clearly that one is challenged to uncover what is missing and find a better explanation: I have lived my life in the presence of predatory theories that explain too much too easily; even before completing the thought behind this paper, I was arguing with it-and I argue with it still. Yet the SSDL model has a life of its own; it has a contribution to make, and it would not leave me in peace until I wrote it up. I present this model, not as a definitive thing, but as another statement in the ongoing conversation of those who encourage self-directed, lifelong learning:

Anyone interested in relating this model to other leading management models (Theory X and Theory Y, for example) should consult chapter 20 in Hersey and Blanchard (1988). But if stages of the Situational  Leadership model bear any  relation to "learning styles" (clearly an important but tangled area of educational theory), Wittstruck (1986) did not find it.

## NOTE

1. Is self-direction personal attribute that develops in stages, or is it a situational response? ~It is both. Even though one's to be a self-directed learner is ultimately (and sometimes strikingly) situational (depending; for example, on self-motivation in the specific learning situation), it is possible to learn how to learn, to learn how to see, to learn to be, in ways that make one more self-directing in many areas of life. This conclusion goes widely-accepted position in the literature namely that self-direction is only "a situational tribute, an impermanent state of being dependent on the learners competence, commitment; and confidence at given moment in time" (Pratt, 1988, P. 162). Whether the difference in these two positions is one of substance or one of emphasis remains to be seen. abilty how against today, at-
