## Research Justification

This book is the result of a longitudinal research project (2016-2018) funded by the National Research Foundation and the Fuchs Foundation, and it disseminates original research. The  project researched  the affordances of indigenous knowledge in the school Science, Technology and Mathematics curricula. Short learning programmes (SLPs) were offered to Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) teachers, during which they engaged in creative and inquiry-based teaching and learning strategies. Research shows that strategies such as problem-based and cooperative learning have the potential to enhance self-directed  learning.  This  design-based  research  was  conducted  in  several provinces in South Africa (North-West Province, the Northern Cape, Limpopo province,  and  Gauteng).  Based  on  the  data  obtained  after  each  intervention, design  principles  were  formulated  for  redesigning  of  SLPs.  The  qualitative research focussed on teachers' lived experiences of the epistemological bordercrossing between Natural Science and indigenous knowledge, their views on the nature of science and indigenous knowledge, and the reformed teaching and learning that took place after the intervention in teachers' classrooms. Most of the  chapters  in  the  book  report  empirical  data,  with  the  exception  of  three chapters (Ch. 2, Ch. 10 and Ch. 11), that can be categorised as systematic reviews. The book is devoted to scholarship in the field of STEM education and teacher professional development, with a specific focus on research into the enhancement of self-directed learning. The target audience are scholars working in the fields of indigenous  knowledge  systems,  STEM  education,  teacher  professional development and self-directed learning. This book makes a unique contribution in  terms  of,  firstly,  its  extensive  use  of  third-generation  Cultural-Historical Activity Theory (CHAT) as a research lens and, secondly, in drawing on research from  the  fields  of  neuroscience,  science  education  philosophy,  self-directed learning and indigenous knowledge systems, in arguing for such border-crossing. Chapter 1 shows how this research contributes to the development of fourthgeneration CHAT, which, owing to the complexity of the object (which Engeström refers to as 'runaway objects'), requires a focus on numerous activity systems. The book also explores the conundrum of research ethics during participatory action research with holders of indigenous knowledge.

In  accordance with the requirements of the Department of Higher Education and Training, this book contains more than 50% original content, and no part of the work has been plagiarised. Ethical clearance for the project was provided by the North-West University's Faculty of Education Research Ethics Committee.

## Foreword

Robert J. Balfour

Deputy Vice-Chancellor: Teaching-Learning, North-West University, Potchefstroom, South Africa

This  book  represents  a  powerful  act  of  scholarly  reclamation, restoration and redress. By locating the text within the nascent scholarship concerning the decolonisation of the curriculum (in fields beyond  postcolonial  literary  studies),  and  positioning Indigenous Knowledge Systems (IKS) as a means through which curriculum  and  curriculum  making,  pedagogy  and  teaching methodologies come to be revisioned, the book makes a powerful, compelling and scholarly case for the imperative to deepen the educational engagement  with  transformation, for teachers, learners and faculty.

The  three  concepts  (reclamation,  restoration  and  redress) echo powerfully in scholars' accounts of the contexts making us aware of the importance of IKS, not only as ways of knowing but also as ways of being and seeing. Reclamation is both restorative and recentring. It aims to restore indigenous to its rightful place in Social Sciences as well as the Natural and Physical Sciences. By doing  so,  it  does  not  fetishise  how  we  understand  the  word 'indigenous' as a historical curiosity, or pseudoscience or merely as  an  illustration  of  what  some  might  consider  to  be  a  more substantive (and invariably Western) body of knowledge. Indigenous, in  this  sense,  refers  to  knowledge  arising  across  a variety  of  communities  and  knowledge  that  is  both  past  and present, that is retrospective and prospective, that is simultaneously scientific and social, that is tangled and yet clearly traceable  and  tangible.  Indigenous,  when  viewed  from  this perspective, concerns also the dignity of reclaiming social and

De Beer (ed.), The decolonisation of the curriculum  project:  The  affordances  of  indigenous  knowledge  for  self-directed  learning (NWU Self-directed Learning Series Volume 2), pp. xxxvii-xxxix, AOSIS, Cape Town. https:/ / doi.org/10.4102/aosis.2019.BK133.00

academic space for communities' knowledge-making approaches, be this through knowledge retrieved or knowledge created anew through the lived experience of groups of people considered as, or who experience themselves as, marginal from the construction, deconstruction and knowledge production project.

This book  reclaims for scholarly endeavour, sources of knowledge long excluded from higher education as well as the school curricula. Tracing the colonial origins of the marginalisation of Indigenous Knowledge (IK), the text simultaneously illustrates what  IK  is,  why  it  matters  and  indeed,  in  many  instances  in postcolonial contexts like South Africa, why it matters more than either the history of its displacement or the academic traditions to  which  it  seeks  to  contribute.  Two  points  are  relevant  here; firstly,  the  project  concerning IK, its definition, practice and its ontologies and epistemologies need to be centred, placed and (re)located within our understanding of what knowledge is, what functions  it  serves  and  might  yet  serve,  as  well  as  to  which communities  (of  scholars,  of  society)  it  contributes  -  again, neither as derivative nor as ancillary to, but as important as what the academy considers worthy in the present as well as in the future. Secondly, the historic refusal to engage with IK, either in terms of curriculum development or innovation, or in terms of scholarly contribution to the world's body of knowledge, is not simply about rejection or marginalisation of a body of knowledge but also about what matters, whose lives matter less or more, who is considered to be less important than, or somehow adjacent to,  the  cosmopolitan  and  urban  Western  subject,  assumed  for too long to be the normative standard by which all self-imagined 'others' are measured.

Indeed,  in  the  context  of  the  classroom,  the  very  notion  of Western  and  non-Western  are  revealed  as  useless  categories whose existence as distinct and mutually exclusive domains are demonstrated (through the close correlations described between Western  scientific  approaches  and  those  approaches  used  by communities to describe, verify, classify and theorise knowledge) and revealed to be colonial fictions, the uses of which have long

been known to be damaging and divisive to human consciousness. Seen in this light, the book also represents scholarly restitution the (re)membering of a body of knowledge originating across the globe, in different spaces and times and yet fascinating in its processes of formation and reformulation; a body of knowledge that refuses the claims of belonging exclusively to one group or another  to  justify  the  unjustifiable:  a  hegemony  which  others while it simultaneously extracts value. In the manifold acknowledgements of the scientific, pedagogic and social value of IK, this book seeks to restore to both the communities and the academy a body of knowledge that adds value to the dignity of human beings as contributing equally, even if in different ways, to knowledge. Using a range of qualitative and quantitative methodologies,  the  research  contribution  of  this  book  to  the transformed knowledge project is of immense value, as it prompts the reader to reconsider assumptions regarding the very ways in which we think about thinking, how we define knowledge and to what purposes we instrumentalise it.

## Glocalisation: The role of indigenous knowledge in the global village

Josef de Beer

Research Unit Self-Directed Learning, Faculty of Education, North-West University, Potchefstroom, South Africa

## Introduction

I would like to start this chapter with two short vignettes, the first of a more personal nature and the second spawned by the 2016 student  unrests  that  erupted  on  university  campuses  across South Africa. These two eclectic pieces remind me of Don Beck and  Linscott's  (1991)  view  that  South  Africa,  with  its  cultural diversity and inequalities, could serve as the world's laboratory. If we can, within this crucible which is South Africa, find solutions to the perennial issues that we face, we could provide the world

with a blueprint for solving similar problems elsewhere on the globe. And this is the essence of this book. The book reflects on research data on attempts of decolonising the curriculum through the infusion of IK into the Science, Technology and Mathematics curricula. It is hoped that these insights could also be relevant elsewhere  in  the  world,  and  that,  in  an  era  of  'glocalisation' (Patel &amp; Lynch 2013), we can also export educational solutions based on research.

The first  vignette  dates  back  to  2009,  15  years  after  South Africa became a democracy. I submitted a paper on IK to The American Biology Teacher (ABT) journal. The paper, co-authored with  Elrina  Whitlock,  focussed  on  the  epistemological  bordercrossing when IK is infused into the Life Sciences curriculum, and how an adapted Kirby-Bauer technique could be used to test the antimicrobial properties of medicinal ( muthi ) plants (De Beer &amp; Whitlock 2009). This paper was an attempt to infuse IK into the school  curriculum  to  capitalise  on  the  tenets  of  the  Natural Sciences. Most scholars occasionally receive a bad peer review. However, bad is probably a euphemism in this case. The editor of ABT  in  those  days,  Ann  Mackenzie,  sent  me  two  peer  review reports, with a note that she would like to publish the piece, but not before I address the concerns of one reviewer. Fortunately, I started reading the positive report of the two, which hailed the innovation of using the processes of science to introduce IK in the  Life  Sciences  school  curriculum.  My  excitement  quickly diminished  when  I  read  the  second  report.  Quite  frankly,  the words  hit  me  like  bullets.  'These  authors  advocate  witchcraft which  seems  to  be  popular  in  the  impoverished,  illiterate  and superstitious South Africa' (Reviewer, undisclosed gender, date unknown). It took me several days to gain the courage to engage with the reviewer's comments and to scrutinise the manuscript for  any  traces  of  what  could  be  considered  'pseudoscience'. However, this made me realise that there are many academics who view IK with scepticism. Later, I realised that there are also plausible arguments against the infusion of IK into the Natural Sciences school curriculum. Onwu and Mosimege (2004) show

that there are big differences in the epistemologies and methodologies  of,  respectively,  Western  science  and  IK.  The latter authors 'are of the opinion that it would be [a mistake] to subject  indigenous  knowledge  […]  to  the  same  verification [processes] as [Western] science' (De Beer &amp; Petersen 2017).

In sharing the second vignette, I need to give credit to Lesley Le Grange. When I read his chapter on the decolonising of the curriculum (Ch. 2), I was moved by Gillian Schutte's impression (captured in Lesley's chapter) of the incident where three women students exposed their breasts during the 2016 student unrests on  the  campuses  of  our  Higher  Education  Institutions  (HEIs), when they were confronted by armed policemen. Here is Gillian's (2016) account:

They looked brave and vulnerable. Their naked stomachs and breasts juxtaposed with police in riot gear armed with guns had a profound effect  on  all.  The  stark  contrast  was  shocking  and  rendered  the  violence of men with guns and riot gear hyper-visible. Naked flesh exposed on the site of violence makes a visceral anti-war statement and this was war. It was a war declared by state and institution against the black child who dared to rise for their rights. Many dismiss the women's naked protest. They bemoaned the fact that yet again black women were forced to lose their dignity by stripping naked. But nakedness is not a loss of dignity when voluntarily used in protest. It is resistance against those who would strip them of their dignity. Women's breasts are a powerful semiotic of resistance. Breasts are the most vulnerable part of their bodies. They are also a source of nurturing. Even men with guns have been nourished on their mother's breasts. Breasts are both robust and vulnerable. These three half-naked women disarmed the police with their naked cries. The police did not fire their guns again. (n.p.)

Both vignettes speak of marginalisation - ostracised knowledge systems in the first case, where the indigenous is seen as inferior to what Mbembe (2016:32) calls a 'Eurocentric epistemological canon'. The second scenario speaks of students who might have physical access to tertiary studies, but not necessarily epistemological  access.  The  'decolonisation  of  the  curriculum' debate is  often  coloured  in  political  undertones.  Although  the

above  vignettes  might  seem  unrelated  at  first  read,  there  is actually a thread connecting them (De Beer &amp; Whitlock 2009):

Under provisions of the Suppression of Witchcraft Act of 1957 , first introduced in 1895, all forms of divination [ - which is at the heart of healing practices in Africa ] were outlawed. (p. 210)

Indigenous Knowledge (IK) was marginalised. This has led to a phenomenon that the Kenyan scholar Wa Thiong'o (1986) refers to  as  the  'colonisation  of  the  mind'.  When  the  students  were protesting  during  the  #FeesMustFall  campaign,  it  was  about more than  just  free  education.  It  was  fuelled  by  conditions  of structural  disenfranchisement  experienced  by  'students  who [wanted] access to opportunities to improve their lives' (Disemelo 2015  cited  in  De  Beer  &amp;  Petersen  n.d.:449).  This  discourse  is discussed in detail in Chapter 2.

However, this  book  argues  for  'the  inclusion  of  indigenous knowledge from a perspective [of neuroscience and] learning psychology' (Jautse, Thambe &amp; De Beer n.d.:442). It is argued that IK, when infused into the curriculum, could, firstly, better contextualise the prescribed learning content for South African learners. I need to state upfront that the point of departure is that the substantive nature of (school) subjects - the principles, theories and 'unifying themes' that have always characterised it - is still considered the 'backbone', but we argue that infusing IK into it will provide  contextualisation that will provide epistemological  access  to  learners.  Secondly,  De  Beer  and Mentz argue that it could also enhance self-directed learning. In Chapter 4, these authors provide a justification for this statement.

The chapters in this book stem from funded research, and we would like to acknowledge the support of the National Research Foundation  (NRF)  and  the  Fuchs  Foundation.  Most  of  the chapters  stem  from  Design-based  Research  (DBR)  conducted from 2016 to 2018. Later in the chapter, I also provide an insight into the shortcomings of the project thus far and discuss the new phase that the project is embarking on, namely, the use of change

laboratories (Virkkunen &amp; Newnham 2013) to obtain buy-in from all stakeholders in the SLPs offered thus far.

This  DBR  project  should  be  viewed  in  the  context  of  the challenges  South  Africa  faces  in  terms  of  teacher  professional development.  When  we  conceptualised  the  project,  we  were guided  by  the  principles outlined for teacher  professional development in the report by the Centre for Development and Enterprise (CDE 2011:22-23), namely:

- · Short workshop-type professional development is not effective.
- · There should rather be a focus on a number of key outcomes or instructional priorities over a longer period of time.
- · For  effective  teacher  learning,  actual  school  and  classroom data should be utilised.
- · The most successful learning occurs when teachers engage with each other, and the experts (teacher educators) should act as 'critical friends' in scaffolding learning.
- · Teachers  should  be  immersed  in  enquiry,  Problem-based Learning (PBL) and experimentation.
- · The focus of teacher professional development interventions should  include  both  Subject  Matter  Knowledge  (SMK)  and Pedagogical Content Knowledge (PCK).
- · Such teacher professional development should take place in the context of whole-school development.

Chapter  2  to  Chapter  11,  despite  their  slightly  eclectic  nature, speak of the above-mentioned principles in one way or the other.

In Chapter  2,  Lesley  Le  Grange  looks  at  the  different perspectives on the decolonising of the curriculum debate. He interrogates  the  tensioned  space  between  the curriculumas-plan and  the curriculum-as-lived and  argues  that  it  is  a space  of  struggle,  creativity,  transformation  and,  notably, decolonisation. Lesley also touches upon the concept of null curriculum , which, among others, refers to IK not being taught in  formal  education.  The  chapter  also  addressed curriculum experimentation, an  aspect  that  is  addressed  in  most  of  the chapters of this book.

As  Cultural-Historical  Activity  Theory  (CHAT)  is  used  as  a research lens in several of the chapters in this book, Elsa Mentz and Josef de Beer explore the affordances of third-generation CHAT in Chapter 3. The chapter sheds light on the versatility of third-generation  CHAT  as  a  qualitative  research  lens,  and  the authors show how it can be used on a personal, interpersonal and institutional plane. By way of illustration, the authors juxtapose two different activity systems - SLPs for teachers on IK in the Northern Cape and Limpopo provinces - to show that there are multiple factors that influence the success of teacher professional development  programmes.  Cultural-Historical  Activity  Theory provides a unique insight into the difficulties of epistemological border-crossing between Western science and IK.

The premise of Chapter 4 is that the holders of IK were, and still  are,  self-directed  learners.  De  Beer  and  Mentz  show,  by referring to Ethnobotanical Knowledge Index (EKI) data (De Beer &amp; Van Wyk 2011), that learning about useful plants in the Namaqua district by people of Khoi-san descent was directed at solving  authentic  problems.  A  second  example  of  subsistence livestock farmers in the Vhembe district in Limpopo is used as an example  of  self-directed  learning.  The  chapter  concludes  by looking at the lessons that these insights hold for formal science education in South Africa. The dominant culture of 'teaching-tothe-test' does not adequately prepare learners for the demands of  a  complex  21st  century,  and  these  authors  argue  that  the holders of IK hold several keys to improving teaching and learning in our schools.

In Chapter 5, Josef de Beer and Ben-Erik van Wyk navigate the chasm between arguments for and against the inclusion of IK in  the  science,  technology  and  Mathematics  curriculum.  The chapter sheds light on neurobiology research and argues for the inclusion  of  IK  from  an  embodied,  situated  and  distributed cognition  perspective.  One  of  the  objections  to  such  bordercrossing is that teachers often view IK as 'pseudoscience', owing to  its  holistic  and  often  metaphysical  nature.  The  authors  use

several examples from ethnobotany to show that there are often scientifically plausible explanations for what at first sight seems like  'magical'  plant  use.  Gorelick  (2014:43)  states  that  'often indigenous  sciences  are  construed  as  pseudoscience,  despite being as sophisticated and nuanced as Western science'. The fact that indigenous science is often characterised by the embracement of  metaphors  sheds  light  on  many  of  the  puzzling  vignettes that make people wonder.

In Chapter 6, Neal Petersen, Aubrey Golightly and Washington Dudu focus on research data obtained during three cycles (20162018) of SLPs offered to Natural Sciences teachers, where the focus  was  on  the  professional  development  of  teachers  to effectively  infuse  IK  into  the  school  curriculum.  Their  findings pave  the  way  for  future  interventions  to  ensure  that  science teachers have more nuanced understandings of, respectively, the Nature of Science (NOS) and IK. An aspect that is emphasised is that supportive communities of practice are needed, to ensure the success of teacher professional development interventions.

Chapter 7, authored by Marthie van der Walt, Erika Potgieter and Divan Jagals, explores research in the field of ethnomathematics. The SLPs for teachers that are the focus of their  research  use  Pedagogy  of  Play  (PoP),  and  through  the engagement  in  indigenous  African  games,  and  making  music, Mathematics concepts are dealt with. The authors share major themes  that  were  elicited  from  the  research  that  spanned  a period of three years. One of the central themes that emerged from  the  research  is  the  affordances  of  ethnomathematics  to enhance the affective domain, and to improve learner motivation and enjoyment of Mathematics.

The focus in Chapter 8 shifts to Indigenous Technology (IT). Marietjie  Havenga  uses  CHAT  as  a  lens  to  contextualise  IT  in problem-based environments. As in Chapters 6 and 7, she also shares  research  findings  emerging  from  technology  teachers' engagement in an SLP on IK. One of the problems highlighted is

the  so-called  wash-out  effect,  where  teachers  often  abandon new  innovative  pedagogies  to  fall  back  on  'chalk-and-talk' approaches.

Recently, Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) education made way for STEAM, the 'A' being arts. In Chapter  9,  Lounell  White,  Susan  Bester  and  Tswakae  Sebotsa explore the affordances of puppetry in education, to teach IK. Puppetry  as  pedagogy  builds  on  storytelling,  which  is  also  a characteristic of IKS. The authors therefore argue that puppetry is an effective way of engaging learners in IK. They share research findings  on  student  teachers'  experiences  of  engaging  with puppetry. The chapter underlines several capacities of imaginative thinking (Lincoln Centre 2018) that are equally relevant in science and arts, such as to observe deeply, to pose questions and make connections, and to live with ambiguity.

Chapter  10  deals  with  the  affordances  of  technology  for teaching IK. Jako Olivier, Christo van der Westhuizen, Dorothy Laubscher and Roxanne Bailey explore the use of technology to embed  IK  in  different  subjects  while  adhering  to  blended, e-learning  and  self-directed  learning  principles.  The  chapter offers  a  critical  literature  review,  and  also  provides  innovative solutions in terms of technology use to enhance both IK and selfdirected learning.

The San Code of Research Ethics is the first indigenous code of researcher ethics in South Africa. In Chapter 11, Melissa Speight Vaughn  and  Marry  Mdakane  investigate  research  ethics  in  the field of IK, and the alignment between research ethics as captured in policy documents at HEIs (Western universality) and the San Code  of  Research  Ethics.  Postcolonial  indigenous  theory  and discourse analysis theory comprise the theoretical framework for their  chapter.  They  quote  Andries  Steenkamp (n.d.:n.p.),  a  San leader, saying, 'come through the door not the window'.

I trust that the chapters in this book will spur further research on the role of IK in STEM education and its affordances for selfdirected learning.

## The design-based research: Looking back; looking forward

This  DBR  project  was  funded  by  the  NRF  and  the  Fuchs Foundation.  Design-based  research  is  rooted  in  pragmatism (Hogue  2013),  as  it  aims  to  find  solutions  to  educational problems in authentic settings.  Design-based  research  serves the dual purpose of assisting in the development of innovative learning interventions, as well as contributing to new theoretical insights into education (Hung 2011). It entails repeated cycles of design, implementation, analysis and revision (Greyling 2007). The research reported on in this book spans three cycles, over a period of three years. After each cycle, design principles were elicited  based  on  our  research  data  and  feedback  from  the teachers who  participated in earlier SLPs. These design principles  informed  the  next  cycle.  In  this  way,  we  tried  to continuously improve upon the SLP, based on experiences from the  preceding  SLPs.  Herrington  et  al.  (2007:2)  mention  that 'design-based  research  should  address  complex  problems  in real  contexts  in  close  collaboration  with  practitioners'.  This description provides a good litmus test to assess the achievements  and  shortcomings  of  the  project,  as  well  as determines the future direction.

## Addressing a complex problem

Science education in South African schools leaves much to be desired, as is illustrated in international benchmark tests such as the  Trends  in  Mathematics  and  Science  Study  (TIMSS).  There are several reasons for this poor performance. The CDE (2011) makes it clear that no schooling system can rise above the limits imposed  by  the  quality  of  its  teachers.  There  is,  therefore,  a need for the country to invest in teacher education. De Beer (2016)  is  of  the  opinion  that  another  reason  for  this  poor performance, which is often overlooked, is the marginalisation of the affective domain. Science themes in the curriculum are

often not perceived as relevant or interesting to the learners. Very  often,  learners  find  it  difficult  to  see  how  the  world  of science relates to their everyday lives.

The inclusion of IK could serve as a bridge between science and everyday life (De Beer 2016). However, research conducted by, among others, Mothwa (2011) and Cronje (2015) shows that most  South  African  teachers  do  not  have  the  knowledge  or skills  to  effectively  implement  IK  in  Science  and  Mathematics lessons.  The  chapters  in  this  book  report  on  a  DBR  project, spanning over three years,  in  which  Science,  Technology  and Mathematics teachers were exposed to the affordances of IK in the classroom.

## Authentic contexts and glocalisation

Learners do not enter the classroom as tabula rasa ;  they come with cultural knowledge based in the environments in which they live. The SLPs, which we report on in this book, were developed to show teachers as to how they could capitalise on this IK, using innovative  teaching  methods,  such  as  PBL  and  Cooperative Learning  (CL).  Such  authentic  contexts,  we  argue,  can  make science more accessible and interesting to learners. Chapter 5 argues the affective affordances of such an approach from the perspective  of  embodied,  situated  and  distributed  cognition (Hardy-Vallée and Payette 2008).

However, there is no consensus among scholars with regard to the  inclusion  of  IK  in  the  STEM  school  curriculum.  Taylor  and Cameron (2016) and Zinyeka, Onwu and Braun (2016) proposed three different perspectives on the relationship between Natural Science and IK.

Firstly, the inclusive perspective views IK as part of science. I  personally  only  partly  agree  with  this  perspective.  There  are several  shared  tenets  between  Western  science  and  IK,  for example,  both  are  empirical,  tentative  and  inferential  (refer  to

Chapter 6 by Petersen et al. for more detail). However, there are also differences between the two - for example, IK is holistic and also includes metaphysical aspects, whereas these do not have a place in the Natural Sciences (refer to Ch. 5 by De Beer and Van Wyk for an in-depth discussion on this). We did not address the metaphysical aspects in the SLPs.

Secondly,  the  exclusive  perspective  sees  IK  and  Natural Science as two different epistemologies. Onwu and Mosimege (2004) are of the opinion that it is not wise to subject IK to the same verification techniques used in the Natural Sciences:

I  don't  think  we  should  be  looking  at  IKS  with  the  same  lens  of judgment as we would with Western science. When I say this I am not  suggesting  that  we  should  just  accept  without  questioning  or verification the rigorous standards that tend to be used in the Western system. In fact, IKS or some of the components thereof have equally rigorous standards of validation and measures that also characterise it. I am suggesting that the two systems are different and therefore require  different  forms  of  verification.  These  verification  methods and processes can actually be equated and be made to be similar standards,  however  they  have  to  be  appropriate  for  each  system, otherwise  we  would  compromise  one  system  at  the  expense  of another and in the process lose the beauty of what the two systems could provide alongside each other. (p. 6)

We  parted  from  such  a  perspective,  in  favour  of  the  third perspective. However, we acknowledge the plea that IK should be appreciated in its uniqueness.

Thirdly, in our SLPs, we followed an approach based on a third perspective,  which  views  Natural  Sciences  and  IK  as  having intersecting  domains.  We  have,  therefore,  exclusively  focussed on  aspects  of  IK  that  are  based  on  empirical  work.  Cronje (2015:37-39) showed that Western science and IK share several tenets,  for  example,  both  acknowledge  that  nature  is  real, observable  and  testable  (its  empirical  nature),  and  that  both science and IK are constantly changing, and therefore transformative  (its  tentative  nature).  Furthermore,  both  are

creative (observations and experiments are not the only sources of scientific knowledge).

One example of a learning activity, based on these shared tenets, is the Kirby-Bauer laboratory protocol, which was used in  the  SLPs.  This  learning  activity  requires  teachers  to  test whether traditional muthi plants have antimicrobial properties (see Ch. 5). This activity demonstrates how science and IK are based on shared tenets. Teachers explored IK using integrated process skills (Sanders 2010), such as designing and conducting experiments and interpreting data. Another example used in the SLPs was soap making. Various indigenous plants contain saponins, which dissolve fat and oily substances (Van Wyk &amp; Gericke  2018).  This  can  provide  an  excellent  activity  for  the chemistry  classroom.  The  caustic  alkali  (such  as  sodium hydroxide) can be replaced by the lye ash from 'soap plants' such as the seepganna ( Salsola aphylla ) or the asbos ( Mesembryanthemum  junceum )  (Van  Wyk  &amp;  Gericke  2018). The  lye  converts  the  fat  or  oil  into  soap  through  a  process known as 'saponification'. In Figure 1.1, science teachers engage in a soap-making activity during a Short Learning Programme (SLP).

Such authentic contexts also provide a platform for glocalised teaching and learning . Patel and Lynch (2013) define glocalised learning and teaching as:

[ T/thinspace ]he curricula consideration and pedagogical framing of local and global community connectedness in relation to social responsibility, justice  and  sustainability  […]  blending  and  connecting  local  and global contexts while maintain[ ing ]  the significant contributions of the different communities and contexts. (p. 223)

Glocalisation  builds  on  the  notion  of  'third  culture  building' (Patel &amp; Lynch 2013:224), which entails an exchange of cultural wealth  (cultural  ideas,  knowledge,  stories,  approaches  to  the cultivation  of  food,  etc.).  Glocalisation  is  a  holistic  perspective, which rejects ethnocentric agendas for such third culture building. Let me illustrate this by means of a practical example. Research literature  (Aktar,  Sengupta  &amp;  Chowdhury  2009)  highlights  the potential risks of insecticides to the health of humans and other life forms, as well as to the environment. Insecticides are, therefore, an issue of global importance. Indigenous knowledge holders in the Giyani district in the province of Limpopo have provided an environmentally friendly solution to potentially dangerous pesticides.  The  predominantly  Tsonga  people  in  Giyani  have been using the fever tree ( Lippia javanica ) as an insect repellent for  decades  (De  Beer  2015).  The  Council  for  Scientific  and Industrialised Research (CSIR) is working with the local community in Giyani and has registered a patent on the use of Lippia javanica as an insect repellent. The community members are involved in making candles using the oils of the fever tree. The volatile oil of the plant contains myrcene, caryophyllene, linalool and ipsdienone, and  research  has  shown  that Lippia  javanica extracts  compare well in terms of efficacy with Diethyltoluamide (DEET), the bestknown commercial mosquito repellent (Van Wyk &amp; Gericke 2018), but without the side effects of DEET. This is an example of localised (indigenous) knowledge, with global application.

Van  Wyk  and  Gericke  (2018:7)  are  of  the  opinion  that  a new  era  has  dawned,  where  collaborations  are  established between government departments, science councils, universities,

traditional  healers,  local  communities  and  entrepreneurs,  in finding  collective  solutions  to  problems  that  humankind  faces. The  results  of  this  effort  are  several  natural  products  that  are already available in local and international markets.

## Collaboration with practitioners

The holders of IK were involved in the conceptualisation of the SLPs.  For  example,  we  worked  with  IK  holders  at  the  Bakone Malapa open-air museum in Polokwane, for the Limpopo SLP. For the SLPs in the North-West province, we again consulted IK holders at the Mphebatho Museum in Moruleng, in the Pilanesberg. For our work in the Namaqua district in the Northern Cape, we consulted with the curator of the Calvinia Museum. The museums became the 'third partner' in the value chain between universities (offering the SLPs) and schools (where teachers have to transfer the new knowledge  and  skills) (Mathews  &amp;  McArthur  2004;  Jautse, Thambe &amp; De Beer 2016). Jautse et al. (2016) opine that teacher educators do not necessarily understand IK or have the skills to effectively facilitate SLPs. The involvement of the holders of IK and museums could, therefore, enhance the quality of such offerings. In Figure 1.2, science teachers engage in activities such as leather tanning at IK museums, under the guidance of IK holders.

When we analysed the data after the SLPs, we realised that we should have consulted more widely. Parents, school principals and officials from the Department of Basic Education should also have been consulted. From the data (presented mainly in Ch. 3 and Ch.  6),  it  became  clear  that  there  is  pressure  on  teachers  to prepare the learners for summative assessment, and this results in many of the goals of the SLP (such as the teaching of IK through PBL and CL approaches) not being transferred to the classroom. Addressing  this  constraint  has  been  set  as  a  goal  for  future interventions and research, where we plan to make use of change laboratories. In Chapter 3, Mentz and De Beer discuss the use of third-generation  CHAT  as  a  research  lens.  These  authors  are currently planning change laboratories and shifting gear towards fourth-generation CHAT in the research on the SLPs.

## The effectiveness of the short learning programmes: Successes and challenges

The data prove that the SLPs were successful in providing the majority  of  the  teachers  with  improved  knowledge  and  skills related  to  epistemological  border-crossing  between  science and IK,  and  learner-centred  methods  such  as  PBL  and  CL.  As the  research  data  are  dealt  with  in  several  of  the  chapters  of this book, I will not repeat this point here. (Refer to Ch. 3 and Ch. 6 for themes emerging from the Natural Sciences SLPs; Ch. 7 for the findings from the Mathematics SLP; and Ch. 8 for perspectives in terms of technology education.) However, we realised, much to our own disappointment, that transfer of knowledge and skills did not occur in many classrooms after the SLP. Several of the teachers reverted back to the traditional chalk-and-talk approaches that they used prior to the intervention. This is an aspect that the researchers will pursue in the next phase of the project. We will follow a two-pronged approach. Firstly, we will use both a longitudinal and systemic approach, supporting online communities  of  practice,  although  our  attempts  in  engaging teachers  in  such  online  communities  of  practice  have  not  been

very effective thus far (refer to Ch. 10). Secondly, we plan to use change  laboratories, in which  various  stakeholders  will be involved (Mentz &amp; De Beer 2019b).

## Change laboratories and fourthgeneration Cultural-Historical Activity Theory

## Involving all stakeholders

As mentioned earlier, our research data (as provided in Ch. 2 to Ch.  11)  make  it  clear  that  transformation  (in  terms  of  teacher professional development) 'cannot be controlled but need[s] to be  influenced  and  shaped'  (Virkkunen  &amp;  Newnham  2013:xvi). Higher education institutions often conceptualise teacher professional development or SLPs according to the insights of the teacher educators at the HEIs, with little or no inputs from teachers  themselves,  or  from  other  stakeholders  such  as  the Department of Education, school management teams, parents or the school learners themselves. In the SLPs that are discussed in Chapter 2 to Chapter 11, we have made the mistake of marginalising some stakeholder voices in the conceptualisation  of  the  SLPs. Although we did consult with holders of IK and museums, we failed to involve officials from the Department of Basic Education (e.g. the subject advisors), principals, parents or learners sufficiently. We are reminded of the wisdom of Bronfenbrenner (1977), who stated that:

[ R ]esearch  on  the  ecology  of  human  development  should  include experiments  involving  the  innovative  restructuring  of  prevailing ecological  systems  in  ways  that  depart  from  existing  institutional ideologies  and  structures  by  redefining  goals,  roles  and  activities and providing interconnections between systems previously isolated from each other. (p. 528)

Although the project was successful in providing teachers with the knowledge and skills to infuse IK into the STEM classroom using PBL and CL, we saw limited success in the transfer of such

knowledge and skills into the classroom. We have realised that there are factors, such as the expectations of parents and school principals that learners should be well prepared for summative assessment opportunities, that can lead to an erosion of the goals set by the SLP. Likewise, our data show that teachers are of the opinion that the work schedule ('pace-setters') provided by the Department  of  Basic  Education  often  prevents  them  from engaging with more learner-centred approaches, as they perceive traditional teacher-centred approaches (chalk-and-talk) as more effective in preparing learners for examinations. This finding is also highlighted in research by Ramnarain and Schuster (2014), who state that:

[ T/thinspace ]he culture of the school and parental expectations played a role in shaping the pedagogical orientation of the teachers. The generally poor  performance  in  national  science  examinations  of  students at  township  schools  has  led  to  a  strong  teaching  focus  towards preparing for high-stakes summative examinations. (p. 648)

Although  principals  and  parents  might  appreciate  IK,  or  the affordances that CL holds, they do not necessarily see how it can contribute to better performance by the learners.

## Change laboratories and expansive learning

In  order  to  address  the  constraints  discussed  in  the  'Change laboratories  and  fourth-generation  Cultural-Historical  Activity Theory' section, Mentz and De Beer (see Ch. 3; Mentz &amp; De Beer 2019b)  are  currently  in  the  planning  phase  of  implementing  a change laboratory, which has also been referred to as a 'bordercrossing laboratory' (Engeström 2001:154). The change laboratory is a method that is embedded in the theory of expansive learning (Engeström  2001).  Engeström  and  Sannino  (2012)  describe expansive learning as:

[ L ]earning  processes  in  which  the  very  subject  of  learning  is transformed from an individual to a collective activity system or a network  of  activity  systems.  Initially  individuals  begin  to  question

the existing order and logic of the activity. As more actors join in, a  collaborative  analysis  and  modelling  of  the  zone  of  proximal development are initiated and carried out. Expansive learning leads to the formation of a new, expanded object. (p. 51)

This collective learning, therefore, includes all the stakeholders, and it assists the group of practitioners in presenting alternative conceptualisations (Engeström 2001).

Very often, teacher professional development is implemented as  a  'top-down'  intervention,  where  HEIs  plan  interventions almost in isolation. Such an approach disregards the essential elements of communication, negotiation and collaboration with all stakeholders  (Virkkunen  &amp;  Newnham  2013).  Mentz  and De Beer (2019a) opine that there is not always good alignment between  the  national  school  curriculum  (the  Curriculum  and Assessment Policy Statement [CAPS]) and the work schedule (or pace-setter) provided to teachers. Whereas IK is acknowledged  as  a  principle  underpinning  the  CAPS,  and emphasis is placed on PBL and CL in the curriculum document, the pace-setter often makes it difficult to address these aspects because of time constraints. Teachers involved in our SLPs often state that the pace-setter is the reason why they do not engage in  PBL  and  CL  methods,  even  after  they  have  witnessed  the benefits of these approaches during the SLP. These 'tensions' are  pointed  out  in  Chapter  3  on  CHAT.  During  a  change laboratory, teachers will have the opportunity to discuss their concerns with officials from the Department of Basic Education, and together they can then explore alternatives and solutions (Mentz &amp; De Beer 2019b).

In Chapter 3, Mentz and De Beer claim that there is often a 'contradiction of control' (McNeil 2013) in terms of the object of the activity system (the professional development aims of the  SLP).  Although  the  teachers  were  generally  excited  to implement the new knowledge and skills in their classrooms after  the  SLP,  they  claimed  that  the  expectations  of  the Department of Basic Education,  as  well  as  the  pace-setters,

prevented  such  implementation.  Change  laboratories,  where teachers, school principals and officials from the Department of Basic Education jointly discuss a problem, and collectively work towards finding solutions, might, in the long run, provide better outcomes.

## Virkkunen and Newnham (2013) state that:

[ A ]  formative  Change  Laboratory  intervention  entails  successive cycles of identifying and formulating problems, questioning previous problem  formulations  and  conceptions  in  the  search  for  the  core source of problems in the current structure and principle of carrying out  the  activity.  A  solution  is  sought  for  through  an  expansive reconceptualization of the object of the activity. (p. 9)

Virkkunen and Newnham (2013:10) emphasise that a change laboratory does not exclusively aim to produce an intellectual solution to a problem but to build 'collaborative transformative agency and motivation'. Engeström et al. (1996) explain that the  method  used  in  a  change  laboratory  is  based  on  the principles  of  re-mediation  and  dual  stimulation,  which  are derived from CHAT. The dual stimulation means that the task 'is  always  interpreted  and  reconstructed  by  the  subject  by means of his or her internalized 'psychological instruments' that cannot be strictly controlled from the outside' (Engeström et al. 1996:7).

The researchers will, in future, strive to involve subject advisors, curriculum  developers,  school  principals,  parents,  learners  and teacher educators, in finding solutions to the 'contradictions of control' that the CHAT analysis has identified in our research.

## Fourth-generation Cultural-Historical Activity Theory and 'runaway objects'

In this book, we have drawn on third-generation activity theory, as conceptualised by Engeström (1987). We have juxtaposed two interdependent activity systems, the SLPs (in which the teachers participated)  and  the  teachers'  classrooms  (where  transfer

should have taken place), to identify 'tensions' that influence the realisation of the 'object' in the activity systems. Tensions often lead  to  a  'contradiction  of  control',  for  example,  teachers  still presenting chalk-and-talk lessons, despite their positive experiences during the SLP. These tensions could stem from the 'community'  (e.g.  expectations  of  parents  or  principals),  from 'rules' (e.g. the rigid pace-setters) or from any other node ('tools', 'subject',  'division  of  labour')  in  the  activity  system.  The  next phase in the project will use fourth-generation CHAT, which is currently  being  developed  by  researchers  such  as  Engeström. To a great extent, fourth-generation  CHAT  has  developed alongside  the  network  society.  Castells  (2005)  defines  the network society as:

[ A ]  social  structure  based  on  networks  operated  by  information and  communication  technologies  based  in  microelectronics  and digital  computer  networks  that  generate,  process,  and  distribute information on the basis of the knowledge accumulated in the nodes of the networks. (p. 7)

These  network  societies  influence  the  'object'  in  the  activity system. Engeström (2009) speaks of 'runaway objects'. These objects  'are  poorly  under  anybody's  control  and  have  farreaching, unexpected effects' (Engeström 2009:303-340). For such 'runaway objects' (e.g. teacher professional development in terms of the SLPs' goals), it is necessary to consider numerous activity systems that are affiliated with the object. This means that  the  object  would  comprise  multiple  perspectives  and collaborations between various actors or stakeholders (Mentz &amp; De  Beer  2019b).  Instead  of  having  two  juxtaposed  activity systems (as explained in Ch. 3), many such activity systems are juxtaposed  (the  subject  advisor  within  the  context  of  the Department of Basic Education, the school principal within the school  context,  the  parent  at  home,  the  teacher  who  has  to navigate  the  tensioned  space  between  the  intended  and  the enacted curriculum, etc.). In Figure 1.3, each of the CHAT triangles represents a different activity system that influences the 'runaway object'.

## Conclusion

The 11 chapters in this book, The decolonisation of the curriculum project:  The  affordances  of  indigenous  knowledge  for  selfdirected learning ,  provide a 'thick description' (Geertz 1973) of three years of research data collected on a DBR project. Despite the  emerging  themes  that  provide  evidence  of  a  successful intervention, there are still shortcomings  that  need  to  be addressed.  This,  I  argue,  can  be  achieved  by  using  change laboratories  that  involve  all  stakeholders.  Such  an  approach would  also  require  the  use  of  fourth-generation  CHAT  as  a research lens.

This  book  provides  scholars  with  an  insight  into  the  lived experiences  of  teachers  and  teacher  educators  involved  in

epistemological border-crossing between the Natural Science curriculum and IK. Third-generation CHAT provides an insight into the 'tensions' that developed  between  the  intended curriculum  (goals  of  the  SLP)  and  the  enacted  curriculum, which  unfolded  in  participating  teachers'  classrooms.  This volume also raises pertinent questions that should be addressed in an era of the 'decolonisation of the curriculum'. In Chapter 3 to  Chapter  6,  reference  is  made  to  the  rich  South  African ethnobotany.  Germishuizen  and  Meyer  (2003)  estimate  the number of angiosperm species in southern Africa to be 21 817. Van Wyk, Van Oudtshoorn and Gericke (2000) estimate that, of these plants, 3000 plants are regularly used as medicines by different cultural groups in the country. This brings the issue of ethics to the fore. How do we, as researchers, acknowledge the intellectual  property  rights  of  IK  holders?  What  guidelines should underpin bioprospecting? These issues are interrogated in Chapter 11.

In  a  complex  and  continually  changing  21st  century,  selfdirected learning is critical in ensuring that the next generation develops  the  skills  needed  to  achieve  self-actualisation.  It  is, therefore, useful to go back in history and to focus on learning in traditional societies. De Beer and Mentz (Ch. 3) claim that the holders of IK are, by definition, self-directed learners, who had to solve authentic problems in their environments. The question should be asked whether or not this is a trademark of South African  school  education  today.  This  focus  on  self-directed learning distinguishes this book from other publications on IKS.

## Summary

This chapter provides an overview of how Chapter 2 to Chapter 11, although slightly eclectic in approach and focus, provide a 'thick description' (Geertz 1973) of how the inclusion of IK could lead to a better contextualisation of the STEM curriculum. In an era where the debate on the decolonisation of the curriculum is receiving increasing  attention,  research  on  the  value  of  IK  in  the  STEM

classroom is important. This chapter also explores the affordances of IK for enhancing self-directed learning. A particular contribution of  this  chapter  is  that  it  locates  the  research  conducted  so far  within  a  broader  DBR  project.  It  also  looks  critically  at the  shortcomings  of  current  interventions,  and  how  'change laboratories' can address many of the shortcomings discussed in the book. Furthermore, this chapter focuses on the role of IK in the  global  village  and  how  it  can  help  solve  perennial  global problems.

## Different voices on decolonising of the curriculum

## Introduction

Decolonisation  is  not  a  new  term.  There  was  sporadic  rebellion against colonial empires on the African continent in the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries. The term 'decolonisation' gained currency after World  War  II  and  signified  the  undoing  of  colonialism,  often  by means of the violent overthrow of colonial states. Decolonisation also refers to the undoing of intellectual colonisation, captured in the content and title of Ng g  wa Thiong'o's (1986) seminal text, ũ ĩ Decolonisation of the Mind .

In contemporary South Africa, there is a renewed interest in decolonisation that was spurred on by the student protests of

How  to  cite: Le  Grange,  L.,  2019,  'Different  voices  on  decolonising  of  the  curriculum', in  J.  De  Beer  (ed.), The  decolonisation  of  the  curriculum  project:  The  affordances  of indigenous  knowledge  for  self-directed  learning (NWU  Self-directed  Learning  Series Volume 2), pp. 25-47, AOSIS, Cape Town. https://doi.org/10.4102/aosis.2019.BK133.02

2015 and 2016, most notably the #RhodesMustFall and #FeesMustFall campaigns. The #RhodesMustFall campaign involved students at the University of Cape Town (South Africa's oldest university) demanding the removal of the statue of British imperialist,  Cecil  John  Rhodes,  from  its  campus.  For  students (particularly black students), the Rhodes statue was a symbol of institutional  racism and exclusion that they experienced at the university. The context of students' experiences was the lopsided demographics at the university - predominantly white academic staff and a growing black student community. According to Van Wyk (2014), even two decades after democracy, 73% of professors and associate professors in South Africa are white, which does not  align  with  demographics  of  the  South  African  population. In the  #RhodesMustFall  campaign,  students  re-invoked  Wa Thiong'o's (1986:n.p.) expression, which was captured in one of the banners  of some  protesters, ' All Rhodes  lead  to the decolonisation of the mind'. The #RhodesMustFall campaign was closely followed by the #FeesMustFall campaign, which involved students at several universities in South Africa (mainly previously white  universities)  demanding  free  higher  education  in  South Africa.  The  demand  for  free  higher  education  was  met  by  the South  African  government,  and  free  higher  education  was introduced  in  2018  for  all  first-year  university  students  whose household  income  was  below  the  threshold  of  R350  000  per annum  (NSFAS  2018).  However,  the  two  campaigns  were  not delinked from one another and laid bare the lack of transformation at  South  African  universities.  Katlego  Disemelo  (2015),  a  PhD student from the University of Witwatersrand, writes the following about the two campaigns:

It is, firstly, about access to equal and quality education. It is about teasing  out  the  ever-so-confusing  intricacies  of  class  relations  in post-apartheid  South  Africa.  It  is  about  eradicating  the  painful exclusion  and  daily  micro  aggressions  which  go-hand-in-hand with institutional racism within these spaces. And it is also about laying bare the failures of the heterosexual, patriarchal, neoliberal capitalist values  which  have  become  so  characteristic  of  the country's universities. (n.p.)

One  of  the  calls from  the  protesting  students  was  for  the decolonisation  of  the  university  and,  more  specifically,  of  the curriculum.  In  response  to  students'  calls,  Minister  of  Higher Education,  Dr  Blade  Nzimande,  called  upon  all  universities  to Africanise  at  a  Higher  Education  Summit  held  in  October  2015. Moreover, some universities appointed task teams (e.g. Stellenbosch University), while others appointed  curriculum  transformation committees (e.g. the University of Cape Town) to explore ways in which  the  curriculum  of  South  African  universities  could  be decolonised. We have also witnessed several conferences organised with  the  theme  of  decolonisation,  special  issues  of  journals  with decolonisation as their theme and a burgeoning body of literature on the topic. This chapter, and this book, provides further evidence of  the  growing  body  of  literature  on  the  topic.  In  this  chapter, I introduce various perspectives on decolonisation. The next eight chapters specifically focus on the affordances of IK in decolonising the curriculum. In Chapter 10, Speight Vaughn and Mdakane look at research ethics from the perspective of the marginalised (such as the  Khoi-san).  Le  Grange  (2019)  avers  that  these  developments signify a period of great ferment in South African higher education.

In this chapter, I discuss the different 'voices' on decolonisation of the curriculum in South Africa - voices of the past, different voices of the present, voices that are dominant and voices of that are silenced in the debate. But, firstly, a word on voice. Voice is variously used in academic writing and is the subject of much debate, particularly since the rise of semiotics and sign theory. Elbow (n.d.) distinguishes between the five senses of voice that could be identified in texts 1 :

- 1. audible voice (the sounds in texts)
- 2.  dramatic voice (the character or implied author in a text)
- 3.  recognisable or distinctive voice
- 4.  voice with authority
- 5.  resonant voice or presence.

1. Here, text refers to anything that carries meaning.

My usage of voice in this chapter does not relate to literal voice, or to the senses, but to the construct voice in academic writing. I  use  the  term  voice  in  a  metaphorical  sense  to  apply  to  the beliefs,  views,  perspectives  and  interests  of  people  (and  the more-than-human-world) and the opportunities that they have to express these. Before discussing different voices on decolonisation  (of  the  curriculum),  I  firstly,  discuss  what  is meant by decolonisation, followed by a discussion on what is meant by curriculum.

## What is decolonisation?

As  mentioned,  decolonisation  refers  to  the  undoing  of  colonial governance when colonial countries attain independence. However, political decolonisation does not mean that all forms of colonisation are  effaced.  The  first  president  of  independent  Ghana,  Kwame Nkrumah (1965), coined the term neo-colonialism to indicate the continuation of ex-colonial influences after independence. Fanon (1967)  also  lamented  at  the  end  of  the  Algerian  War  that decolonisation  had  not  occurred;  instead,  Africanisation  was  in place. Wa Thiong'o's call for the decolonisation of the mind after independence  suggests  that  political  decolonisation  does  not necessarily result in cognitive decolonisation.

A  contemporary  community  of  Latin  American  decolonial scholars provides us with a more nuanced understanding of what Nkrumah (1965), Fanon (1967) and Wa Thiong'o (1986) observed. They  distinguish between  colonisation  and  coloniality, and between  decolonisation  and  decoloniality.  The  works  of  these scholars focus on the 'coloniality of knowledge' and the 'coloniality of being' (Mignolo 2007:156-157). They aver that although former European colonies attained independence, and in this sense we live in postcolonial times, the logic of coloniality remains with us. In  other  words,  the  systems  of  power  that  classify  (othering), denigrate and subjugate remain prevalent, and, in a contemporary globalising world, are more insidious than previous, more naked, forms  of  colonisation.  Drawing  on  the  insights  from  Quijano,

Mignolo  (2007:156)  describes  the  colonial  matrix  of  power  as having  four  interlocking  domains,  namely,  control  of  economy (land  appropriation,  exploitation  of  labour,  control  of  natural resources),  control  of  authority  (institution,  army),  control  of gender and sexuality (family, education), and control of subjectivity and knowledge (epistemology, education and identity formation).

Decoloniality, therefore, concerns a critical awareness of the logic of coloniality (the colonial matrix of power); it is a critique of coloniality, resists expressions of coloniality and takes actions to overcome coloniality. Applied to South Africa, the coloniality or decoloniality lens enables one to understand that apartheid was a particular manifestation of coloniality rather than a period distinct from colonialism, as Jansen (2017) suggests.

Decolonisation is not always used to refer to the removal of colonial systems of governance. It is also invoked by indigenous scholars or communities to represent a broader process whereby colonised peoples correct the deficient ways in which they have come to be defined, seek self-determination, discover and recover their IK and sense of self, mourn the pain inflicted upon them by colonisation, etc. Chilisa (2012:15-17, cited in Le Grange 2016a:4-5) suggests five phases in the process of decolonisation:

- 1. rediscovery and recovery
- 2.  mourning
- 3.  dreaming
- 4.  commitment
- 5.  action.

Rediscovery  and  recovery is the  process  whereby  colonised peoples  rediscover and  recover their own  history, culture, language and identity. Mourning refers to the process of grieving the  sustained  onslaught  on  the  world's  colonised  peoples' identities and social realities. It is an important part of healing and  leads  to  dreaming. Dreaming is  when  colonised  peoples invoke their histories, worldviews and IKS to theorise and imagine alternative possibilities such as a decolonised curriculum.

Commitment relates to academics or students pledging to labour vigorously  to  include  the  voices  of  colonised  peoples  in  the university  curriculum. Action is  the  phase  where  dreams  and commitments  are  translated  into  concrete  plans  for  social transformation. Smith (1999) identified the following elements of decolonisation:

- · deconstruction and reconstruction
- · self-determination and social justice
- · ethics
- · language
- · internationalisation of indigenous experiences
- · history
- · critique.

Deconstruction and reconstruction concerns correcting what has been  wrongfully  written  about  indigenous  peoples  and  laying bare how their life experiences have become distorted and the deficit ways in which they have become labelled (Chilisa 2012). Self-determination and social justice is about seeking legitimacy for  the  knowledges,  histories,  experiences  and  ontologies  of indigenous  peoples. Ethics is  concerned  with  putting  in  place regulation  that  will  ensure  the  protection  of  IKS. Language concerns the importance of adopting indigenous languages for teaching  and  learning  as  part  of  the  anticolonial  struggle. Internationalisation of indigenous experiences relates to indigenous  scholars  sharing  common  experiences,  issues  and struggles in the spaces that globalisation affords. History , in this context, involves a study of the past to recover the history, culture and languages of colonised people and to bring them to bear on the  present. Critique concerns  a  critical  assessment  of  the imperial model of the academy that does not offer opportunities for indigenous scholars to communicate from their own frames of reference (Chilisa 2012).

A question that is often asked is, what are the links between decolonisation and the constructs of Africanisation and indigenisation?  In  my  earlier  reference  to  Fanon,  it  is  evident that,  for  him,  there  is  a  difference  between  decolonisation

and  Africanisation.  For  Fanon,  Africanisation  means  merely replacing colonialists with Africans without fundamentally changing the structures of governance and the values of society. Africanisation, in the sense that Fanon used it, was tantamount to Nkrumah's concept of neo-colonialism. Prah's (2004) distinction between  Africanisation  and  Africanism  is  helpful.  For  Prah (2004),  Africanisation  relates  to  the  deliberate  deployment  of Africans in positions of importance so that African majorities are demographically represented in all areas of social life. Although this may serve as the basis for Africanism, the latter is concerned with making African culture the centre of Africa's development or, as Prah (2004:105) succinctly puts it, 'African culture should occupy a central position in the overall social activity of Africans'. For  Fanon,  decolonisation  on  the  African  continent  would require  both  Africanisation  and  Africanism.  There  is  one  other obvious distinction between Africanisation and decolonisation Africanisation is necessarily circumscribed to Africa and African diaspora, whereas decolonisation is a construct that has broader meaning and application  across  the  globe.  Decolonisation  has been embraced by indigenous peoples globally, as captured in my discussion of the process of decolonisation that Chilisa (2012) identifies,  and  in  the  elements  of  decolonisation  that  Smith (1999) identifies. Decolonisation is evidently a broader concept than indigenisation, but the latter could be viewed as one form of decolonisation. For a more detailed discussion of the resonances and  dissonances  between  decolonisation,  Africanisation  and indigenisation, see Le Grange (2018). This brings us to a discussion on curriculum.

## Curriculum and its decolonisation

Curriculum is a polysemous term. Its meaning differs based on context, historical times and philosophical assumptions. Generally, curriculum relates to what knowledge is included in teaching and learning programmes, as captured in Herbert Spencer's (1884) perennial question in the title of his book, What knowledge is of most worth ? What knowledge, and whose knowledge is of most

worth, is at the heart of what the decolonising of the curriculum is all about. However, I shall broaden the discussion so that the concept curriculum is expanded to a construct that involves more than 'what knowledge' is included in education programmes.

Although there are different perspectives on curriculum, one view of curriculum became dominant in the latter half of the 20th century and continues to do so in the first two decades of the 21st century. This view of curriculum is neo-Tylerian 2  and is described by Gough (2013:1216, as cited in Le Grange 2016a) as follows:

Tyler  and  Biggs  represent  curriculum  as  a  simple,  tightly  coupled system in which it is both possible and desirable to closely align what students do in order to learn with intended learning outcomes and how they are assessed. (p. 7)

This instrumentalist and utilitarian view of curriculum is colonising in the sense that it proposes one way of knowing, being and becoming as the only way of knowing, being and becoming. In other words, this dominant view of curriculum does not take into consideration the uniqueness of each individual; each person's peculiar desires, hopes and beliefs; as well as significations of race, gender, sexual orientation,  etc.  However,  Le  Grange  (2016a)  opens  up  ways  of thinking about curriculum in order to invigorate potentially decolonising lines that escape the colonising effects of curriculum produced in the Tylerian mould. I revisited Le Grange's (2016a) ideas on curriculum to show how he engages with the works of scholars such  as  Madeleine  Grumet  (1981),  Ted  Aoki  (1999),  Elliot  Eisner (1985), Pinar (1975, 2011) and Jason Wallin (2010).

Madeleine  Grumet  (1981)  provides  an  alternative  view  of curriculum to that of Tyler (1949) and describes 'curriculum as the  stories  that  we  tell  students  about  their  past,  present  and future'  (Le  Grange  2016a:7).  Given  that  we  have  not  yet  been

liberated from the fetters of Tyler's notion of curriculum in the 21st century, Grumet's (1981:n.p.) alternative view of curriculum is pertinent because it enables us to ask critical questions, such as 'which  stories  are  students  told  about  their  past,  present  and future?',  'whose  stories  are  they'?  and  'who  tells  the  stories?' Another scholar, Ted Aoki (1999, as cited in Le Grange 2016a:7) argues that curriculum should not only focus on the planned (the curriculum-as-plan ) but also on how it is lived (the curriculum-aslived ) - how the curriculum is lived by students and lecturers.

Aoki importantly points out that legitimating the curriculumas-lived does not discard the curriculum-as-plan , but legitimating the  former  produces  a  tensioned  space  in  between  the  two, which  is  a  space  of  struggle,  creativity  and  transformation. What the student protests of 2015 and 2016 laid bare was that the  lived  experiences  of  students  (both  inside  and  outside  of the university) had not been recognised by many lecturers and university managers, and that this dimension of curriculum did not  enjoy  legitimacy  in  the  university.  Attentiveness  to  Aoki's wisdom  of  legitimating  the curriculum-as-lived (alongside  the curriculum-as-plan ) could have potentially transformative effects in  South  African  universities.  Moreover,  the  tensioned  space between the curriculum-as-plan and the curriculum-as-lived has the potential to become a decolonising space.

Curriculum  scholars  such  as  Eisner  (1985,  as  cited  in  Le Grange 2016a:8) have also distinguished between three broad perspectives  on  curriculum  that have  not  received  much attention  with  respect  to  universities,  namely,  the explicit, implicit (hidden) and null curriculum. The explicit curriculum is what students are provided with by lecturers, such as module frameworks,  prescribed  readings,  assessment  guidelines,  etc. The implicit (hidden) curriculum is what students learn about the dominant culture of a university and what values it reproduces. What PhD student Katlego Disemelo (2015) expresses, in the quote  used  earlier,  bears  testimony  to  her  insights  into  the hidden curriculum of South African universities - the 'neoliberal capitalist values', 'institutional racism', 'patriarchy', etc.

The hidden curriculum relates to what the molar identity of a university  is  -  the  'ideal'  against  which  everyone  is  measured and declared different. 'The null curriculum is what universities leave out - what is not taught and learned in a university' (Le Grange 2016a:8). An example would be the fact that IK is not taught  in  many  universities,  or  faculties  of  universities.  The distinction between the three curriculum types helps to ask, for example, what the hidden curriculum of Stellenbosch University is, or what the null curriculum of NWU is.

William Pinar (1975, as cited in Le Grange 2016a:8) first invoked the etymological root of curriculum, the Latin term currere , which means 'to run the course'. He did so to refocus curriculum on the significance of individual experience; 'whatever the course content or alignment with society or the economy' (Pinar 2011:xii). Currere foregrounds the individual and, Pinar (2011:2) argues, is a complicated  concept  because  each  of  us  is  different  -  in  our genetic makeup, our upbringings, our families, and more broadly our race, gender, class, etc. Put simply, currere shifts the attention away from the concept of a predetermined course to run and focuses on how the course is run by each individual, given each person's unique makeup, context, hopes, aspirations and interactions with other human beings and the more-than-human world. In other words, each individual has his or her own life story, and understanding one's own story through academic study is at the heart of curriculum. Pinar develops currere as an autobiographical method with four steps or moments regressive , progressive analytical , and synthetical -  that depict both temporal and reflective moments for autobiographical research of educational experience (Pinar et al. 1995):

- · The regressive step focuses on the past, a moment in which one re-enters the past so as to enlarge and/or transform one's memory.
- · The progressive moment or step focuses on the future. Pinar (2004:36) avers that in this step, one looks forward to what is not  yet  present;  one  meditatively  imagines  possible  futures and also how the future inhabits the present.

- · The analytical step involves a distancing from one's past and future to create a space of freedom in which one analyses how the future is present in the past, the past in the future and the present in both (Pinar 2004:36-37).
- · The synthetical step brings about a sense of wholeness as one re-enters the lived present and asks 'what the meaning of this present is?'  It  also  involves  a  process  of  awareness  of  what flows within us, what drives us to do and be, and what gives meaning to our lives.

Pinar's  autobiographical  method, currere, resonates  with  the project of decolonisation in that a fundamental concern for both is  the  (re)construction  of  the  subject.  Pinar  (2011)  argues  that subjective  reconstruction,  a  central  concern  of currere ,  is  one form  of  decolonisation.  Decolonial  revolutionary  Fanon  (1967) emphasises the primacy of the liberation of the individual in the process of decolonisation. Goldie (1999:79) goes so far as to say that for Fanon, 'true liberation is the achievement of subjectivity'. Pinar (2011) neatly captures the role of currere in the psychosocial transformation of the colonised subject:

Autobiography - the regressive-progressive-analytic-synthetic method of currere -  can be political when it disables, through remembrance and reconstruction,  colonisation  through  interpellation.  By  affirming  the capacity to restructure one's subjectivity, autobiography disentangles us from absorption into collectives - even when presumably these are self-affirming cultural identities. (p. 40)

Importantly, however, Pinar (2011) does point to the danger of the narcissism  of  identity  politics  and  therefore  advocates  invoking currere to perform a collective autobiography as an impetus for political mobilisation. The regressive step of currere enables the individual to re-enter the past and to focus on colonial influences on his or her life and, in particular, how the individual has actively taken up colonial discourses. This step is also a moment in selfcriticism and marks the beginning of the individual's efforts to rid himself or herself of the fetters of colonial thought. The progressive step focuses on the future and the individual imagines a future that is more just and more democratic, for example. In the analytic step, the individual distances himself or herself (akin to bracketing

in phenomenology) from the past and future and analyses how the past,  future  and  the  present  are  imbricated  in  one  another.  By distancing  himself  or  herself  from  the  past  and  the  future,  the individual is able to experience a moment of freedom from the present - free from colonising thoughts. In the synthetic moment, the individual re-enters the present with a renewed sense of self, able  to  see  the  wholeness  of  past,  present  and  future,  and asks, 'what does this mean and what can I do?' This is the moment when the individual is able to join others in order to mobilise them into  collective  action  to  alter  the  present,  and  this  will  make possible a different future.

As  cited  in  Le  Grange  (2016a:10-11),  recently,  a  Canadian scholar, Jason Wallin, revisited the notion of currere . Inspired by Deleuze and Guattari (1994), he reframed the idea of a concept, proposing that it is not a name attached to something, but a way of approaching the world. Deleuze and Guattari's (1994) interest is  not  in  what  a  concept  is,  but  in  what  it  does.  Wallin  draws attention to the paradoxical character of currere 's etymology: its active  and  reactive  forces.  Thinking  of  curriculum  as  an  active conceptual force means that the concept does not convey an a priori image  of  a  pedagogical  life.  It  instead  relates  to  the immanent potential of the becoming of a pedagogical life - the multiple  coursings  of  a  pedagogical  life  that  exists  prior  to thought. As Wallin (2010) neatly captures:

[ To ] run implies that the conceptual power of currere is intimate to its productive capacity to create flows, offshoots, and multiplicitous movements.  For  example,  the  'running'  roots  of  rhizomatic  bulbs and tubers extend to create new interfaces with other organic and nonorganic  bodies,  extending  the  experience  of  what  a  body  can become ….  Running  flows  of  volcanic  magma  create  new  courses along  and  through  the  ostensible  stability  of  the  Earth's  mantle, articulating  the  immanent  geomorphic  potential  of  territories  to deterritorialisation […] A musical 'run' creates lines of flight potentially incongruous with the codes that structure it, overflowing, extending, and traversing tonal registers in producing new affects. (p. 2)

The  conceptual  power  of currere implies  newness,  creation  of things  unforeseen,  experimentation,  expanding  of  difference

and movement. This notion of curriculum makes possible multiple pathways for the becoming of pedagogical lives and therefore is decolonising. Currere's reactive form colonises, where one way of  knowing  becomes the only way  of  knowing.  The  reactive power  of currere severs currere of  its  immanent  potential  to become other.

I have presented different ways of understanding curriculum so as to invigorate decolonising vectors that might enable us to live,  be  and  become  other  (different).  I  now  discuss  different voices involved in South Africa's current (cognitive) decolonial moment.

## Different voices on decolonisation

In South Africa's decolonial conversation currently taking place, a range of voices are emerging. I shall discuss some of the voices in South  Africa's  decolonial  moment,  most  notably  voices  of  the past, voices of university leaders, voices of students and voices silenced.  Many  more  voices  could  have  been  discussed  in  this chapter,  but  such  an  effort  would  have  required  a  lengthier treatise.  Attempts  to  make  sense  of  moments,  such  as  South Africa's  present  decolonial  moment,  almost  inevitably  involve invoking voices of the past - those who have passed on and/or those who are still with us in body, but whose works might be gathering dust. In the burgeoning literature on decolonisation of the curriculum, we see or hear the voices of, among others, Steve Biko, Aimé  Cesaire,  Emmanuel  Eze,  Frantz  Fanon,  Kwame Nkrumah, Albert Memmi and Ng g  wa Thiong'o. The lives and ũ ĩ works of these people are invoked to help us in our struggle to make  sense  of  the  present,  to  find  points  of  resonance  and dissonance between their views and ours, to rethink their ideas so as to create something new in the present, and to enable us to imagine a different future that is a synthesis of the past and the present (but more than the sum of the two). But, let me share a few examples of how the thoughts and ideas of some of these authors are being (re)invoked in the present. Steve Biko is being (re)invoked in arguments to advance black studies in South Africa

(and elsewhere) based on the idea that blackness is an important and productive counter-narrative in a context where whiteness dominates (Lamola 2018). Fanon's life and works help us to make sense of the difference between decolonisation and Africanisation. They give us a sense of the importance of the individual labour that both the colonised and the coloniser need to undergo in the process of psychosocial transformation - Fanon's assertion that there  can  be  no  decolonisation  without  individual  liberation  is noteworthy.  This  insight  of  Fanon  has  enabled  us  to  generate lines of  connection  with  Pinar's currere (discussed  earlier), opening up ways of understanding decolonisation as an inherently curriculum matter.

Eze's  (2011)  idea  of  a  postracial  future  enables  us  to  critically examine the issue of 'race' in current discourses on decolonisation in South Africa. I shall return to the issue of race later. The (re)invocation of Wa Thiong'o's 'decolonisation of the mind' by both students and scholars invites critical questions about the productiveness of such a move. The focus on the mind neglects the body and spirit and reinscribes Descartes' (1637) problematic cogito ,  'I  think therefore I am', which has resulted in the privileging of the mind in modern education, while the body is declared inferior - the destruction of the more-than-human-world or other-than-human world ('nature') by humans because of their 'superior' minds.

We have also heard the voices of university leaders in the media during the student protests. In his book, As by Fire, Jansen (2017) interviews 11 South African university vice-chancellors concerning their lived experiences of the student protests of 2015 and 2016. Jansen's  (2017)  book  gives  us  an  insight  into  the  views  and experiences of  selected  vice-chancellors  and,  of  course,  his  own  voice (both as Vice-Chancellor and the author of the text). In the book, vice-chancellors share their shock at the level of violence during the protests, the fact that the government had not listened to their warnings  about  declining  subsidies  and  rising  student  fees,  challenges to their leadership that they experienced and so on. Throughout the book, there are lengthy quotes from the vice-chancellors, but, interestingly, Jansen does not ask the vice-chancellors about their

views on decolonisation (of the curriculum). He chooses to author a chapter in the book on decolonisation without any quotations from the other vice-chancellors. However, in one of the other chapters, a Vice-Chancellor raises an issue that is a recurring theme in the decolonisation  conversation  in  South  Africa,  that  is,  the  issue  of 'race'.  I  quote  Rhodes  University  Vice-Chancellor,  Sizwe  Mabizela (in Jansen 2017):

One dimension that has troubled me immensely about the recent student activity is the essentialisation of race and the view that by virtue of the pigmentation of your skin, you are white. You therefore can't say anything about black people and the experience of black people. You must be silent, keep quiet. You know nothing about it. And I think this is so antithetical to what it means to be a university.

One  of  our  outstanding  professors,  who  happens  to  be  a  white woman, an excellent academic, has been so frustrated because in political  science,  three  black  students  were  simply  saying  to  her, 'Shut up! You don't know what it means to be black'. The same thing happened to another of our white academics, a South African, who wrote a book on Ubuntu, and he was taken to task: 'What do you know about Ubuntu?' (p. 131)

I shall return to the issue of 'race'. But, I first proceed to briefly discuss some aspects of Jansen's chapter on decolonisation. In his chapter, Jansen claims to debunk the sense and non-sense in relation to the decolonisation of the curriculum. He provides a background to the topic 'decolonisation' and attempts to clarify what is meant by the 'decolonisation of curriculum'. In the latter half of his chapter, he raises three arguments about decolonisation of the curriculum that warrant further discussion.

Jansen (2017) points out that the rhetorical value of calls to decolonise the curriculum in student politics is far removed from the  desire  to  change  the  curriculum  in  universities.  Moreover, students appear to invoke notions of decolonisation for symbolic reasons  only,  as  these  students  and  academics  return  to  the settled curriculum after the protests. Consequently, no meaningful change takes place. He points out that history shows this to be the  case  and  uses  the  example  of  the  People's  Education movement of the 1980s.

Jansen's invocation of political symbolism is insightful, but there might be other reasons as to why meaningful curriculum change has not happened  in  universities following student  protests. Typically, students do not inhabit universities for extended periods of time; they complete their studies and move on. Students' calls during protests can, therefore, only serve as a trigger or catalyst for curriculum change. Curriculum change depends on what academics and university leaders do, which requires a commitment to complete the ethico-onto-epistemological 3  labour. It is worth noting that the student protests in Paris in 1968 provided the stimulus for what, today, is called French poststructuralism, a movement and academic discipline  that  has  radically  changed  thinking  in  both  the  global north and global south; its protagonists (such as Michel Foucault) remain the most cited scholars, even after their deaths. A second argument Jansen makes is that most academics are disciplinarians in the sense that they have been socialised into particular disciplines and, therefore, engaging with other knowledges would be challenging. Jansen is correct, but we also know that disciplinary knowledge  is  proving  to  be  inadequate  in  addressing  pressing challenges of our time, such as growing inequality in the world and unprecedented levels of environmental problems. The fact that one is  a  disciplinarian  does  not  mean  that  one's  professional  identity cannot change - professional identity is not fixed but is fluid. We are already witnessing the de-territorialisation of disciplinary knowledge and  the emergence  of  interdisciplinary, multidisciplinary and transdisciplinary  trajectories.  Le  Grange  (2017)  avers  that  the emergence of transdisciplinary  research  could  be  understood  as the consequence of at least three  separate  but  related  developments:

- · the fissures internal to disciplines
- · the  emergence  of  a  socially  distributed  knowledge  system brought about by the massification of higher education
- · the limits of disciplinary knowledge  to  respond  to  the complexity of planetary problems.

3.  I  aver  that  ontology,  axiology  and  epistemology  are  not  separate  categories,  but  are imbricated in one another.

A  third  argument  put  forward  by  Jansen  (2017:167)  is  an  issue I  referred  to  earlier.  Jansen  argues  that  what  was  evident  in  the students' protests was a popular understanding of decolonisation that he describes as the 'hard version' of Africanisation - 'a dangerous nativism often expressed  in racist terms'. He  writes, '[i]t is unapologetically the black African, to the exclusion of all other South Africans'  (Jansen  2017:167).  Jansen's  position  resonates  with  the words of the Vice-Chancellor of Rhodes University quoted earlier and to Eze's (2014) view that a specific focus on the condition of black people is 'to indulge in a parochial social anthropology, racial essentialism and jingoistic race-based provincialism' (Lamola 2018:2). However, an interest in the specific condition of black people is not tantamount to engaging in biological or racial essentialism.

I, of course, agree that there is no simple association between the colour of a person's skin and his or her manner of thinking or being.  However,  in  South  Africa  (and  elsewhere),  there  are privileges derived from being white, and white lived experience has become idealised (whiteness) in the modern world. Moreover, Lamola (2018:2) argues that 'whitely thinking' has become the mainstream  epistemology  of  the  modern  world,  which  has resulted in the subjugation of black being and lived experience. This, as I have argued, is what the student protests of 2015 and 2016 laid bare in relation to South African universities.

In his discussion on blackhood and the self, Lamola (2018:7) argues that black existence needs to be understood in terms of what he calls 'existentiality' and not essentialism. By existentiality, he  refers  to  the  intra-subjective  consciousness  of  the  black person,  and  the  external  institutional  impositions  on  the  black person's self-consciousness. He (Lamola 2018) writes:

The given fact of existence as a black person, as a conscious being, is therefore about self-understanding (and self-negotiation) as a black person in constant confrontation with externally imposed definitions and categorisations of black personhood. It is in this sense that this self-negotiated selfhood is blackhood. (p. 7)

Lamola's (2018) blackhood  resonates  strongly with Pinar's method of currere , and the latter could contribute systematicity

to  the  labour  of  the  black  person  (student)  in  the  process  of engaging in Lamolo's self-understanding and self-negotiation blackhood becomes curriculum.

During the student protests, we heard the voices of students we heard their cries and calls, such as 'decolonise the curriculum'. Some  students  expressed  their ideas articulately, such as Disemelo  quoted  earlier.  Other  expressions  were  problematic, such as those from some students at the University of Cape Town who demonstrated a lack of understanding of Western science in the #ScienceMustFall campaign (see Jansen 2017:155). 4 Nevertheless,  I  wish  to  highlight  a  particular  moment  of  the #FeesMustFall campaign that is worth reflecting on.

There  were  many  attempts  by  police  armed  with  guns  to silence the voices of students. In one moment during the protests, three female students exposed their naked breasts as they faced police armed with guns. Images of the three half-naked students went viral, and many commented. But, journalist Gillian Schutte captures the moment so poignantly, demonstrating the importance of the body (that the body has a voice), and gives literal meaning to Deleuze's figuration, 'we cannot know what a body will do'. Schutte (2016) writes:

They looked brave and vulnerable. Their naked stomachs and breasts juxtaposed with police in riot gear armed with guns had a profound effect  on  all.  The  stark  contrast  was  shocking  and  rendered  the violence of men with guns and riot gear hyper-visible. Naked flesh exposed on the site of violence makes a visceral anti-war statement and  this  was  war.  It  was  a  war  declared  by  state  and  institution against  the  black  child  who  dared  to  rise  for  their  rights.  Many dismiss  the  women's  naked  protest.  They  bemoaned  the  fact  that yet again black women were forced to lose their dignity by stripping naked. But nakedness is not a loss of dignity when voluntarily used in  protest.  It  is  resistance  against  those  who  would  strip  them  of their dignity. Women's breasts are a powerful semiotic of resistance. Breasts are the most vulnerable part of their bodies. They are also

a  source  of  nurturing.  Even  men  with  guns  have  been  nourished on their  mother's  breasts.  Breasts  are  both  robust  and  vulnerable. These three half-naked women disarmed the police with their naked cries. The police did not fire their guns again. (n.p.)

I  contend that the protest movements of 2015 and 2016 could have  potentially  transformative  effects  on  higher  education  in South Africa. The conferences, burgeoning literature, etc. present evidence of some notable effects. However, meaningful curriculum change will  depend  on  finding  ways  to  listen  to  the  voices  of students in a sustained way - that their lived experiences and perspectives  are  taken  seriously  by  all  role  players  in  higher education - as their voices are a barometer of broader challenges faced  by  society.  However,  meaningful  curriculum  change  will require  a  radical  rethinking  of  higher  education,  a  discussion I return to in my parting thoughts.

There are also voices that have been silenced in decolonisation conversations,  and  I  am  not  referring  to  human  voices,  but the  voice  or  voices  of  the  more-than-human  world.  It  is  the voice or voices that indigenous peoples know  and  have come  to  understand.  Indigenous  people,  for  example,  know the importance of listening to the voice of the land - that the land is their teacher and not something that is to be possessed and exploited for economic gain. More recently, some Western scholars  have  come  to  appreciate  the  agential  capacities  of the  more-than-human world, conceiving of a new materialism. New  materialism  questions  the  privileging  of  subjectivity  and representation  and,  according  to  Braidotti  (2012:171),  replaces textual and other deconstruction with the ontology of modulated presence.  New  materialists  find  inspiration  from  the  thinking of  the  late  Deleuze,  who collaborated with Guattari, in placing the  human  on  an  immanent  plane,  thereby  stripping  it  of  its ontological  privilege.  Moreover,  new  materialists  hold  that  all matter (including  organic  matter)  has  agential  capacities.  This idea is depicted in Barad's (2007:132) concept of 'agential realism'. About the idea that 'nature' is agentic, Gough (2016:52) writes, '[...]  it  acts,  and  those actions have consequences for both the

human and nonhuman world'. Crucial here is that, even though the more-than-human-world ('nature') is silenced in discourses on decolonisation (of the curriculum), 'nature' will not be silenced and its voice is thunderous - it hits back hard and its effects are real, as we are already witnessing with climate change.

## Conclusion

## Some parting thoughts - Rethinking curriculum through improvisation

As  cited  in  Le  Grange  (2016b:32),  in  1981,  Japanese-Canadian curriculum  scholar  Ted  Aoki  learnt  that  Bobby  Shew  (a  jazz trumpeter) was a visiting scholar to the music department at the University of Alberta. Aoki loved music and used the opportunity to invite Bobby Shew to speak at a staff and student seminar in his department. Aoki asked Bobby Shew to speak to, sing to or play to 'when does an instrument cease to be an instrument?' and 'what is improvisation?'. Why did Aoki ask Shew to address these two questions?  For  Aoki  (in  Pinar  &amp;  Irwin  2004:368),  the  field  of curriculum had become fraught with performative words reflective of  instrumentalism  (words  such  as  goals  and  objectives  and products, achievement and assessment); education was under the technological rationality - ' a way to do, has become the way of doing […]'.

To the first question, Shew replied (Pinar &amp; Irwin 2004):

When music to be lived calls for transformation of instrument and music into that which is bodily lived - The trumpet, music, and body must become as one in a living wholeness. (p. 368)

To the question on what it is to improvise, Shew retorted that, when improvising with fellow musicians, they do not only respond to  each  other  but  also  to  whatever  calls  upon  them  in  that situational moment, and that no two situational moments (like life itself) are the same (Pinar &amp; Irwin 2004).

Aoki  (in  Pinar  &amp;  Irwin  2004:369)  invites  us  to  rethink  the instrumental language in curriculum talk, captured in expressions

such  as  'curriculum  development',  'curriculum  implementation', 'curriculum integration' and 'curriculum piloting'. He suggests that we should instead develop a new language that is non-instrumental, with expressions such as 'curriculum improvisation' and, I would add, 'curriculum experimentation'. Expressions such as 'curriculum implementation' require lecturers to be loyal to a curriculum and be indifferent to their lives, the lives of students and the context in which  they  find  themselves.  In  contrast,  when  lecturers  are improvisers,  they  are  attuned  to  both  their  own  and  students' changing lives as well as to the mutuality of the contexts in which they find themselves. Le Grange (2014:1292, and cited in 2016b:32) argues  that in the case  of curriculum implementation,  the performance of the lecturer mimics the conductor of a classical orchestra where the composer is often positioned external to the performance. Although there is some interpretation of the musical piece, the conductor (lecturer) has to ensure that the members of the orchestra (learners) play each note correctly. A deviation from the musical sheet (the intended curriculum) is viewed as a mistake (Le Grange 2014). However, in the case of curriculum improvisation, pedagogy is  akin  to  improvisational  jazz  where  every  musician (student) is a composer. In the classroom context, although the (lecturer)  may  be  more  experienced  and  'knowledgeable',  the educative performance, as in the case with improvisational jazz, is an assemblage of interactions that make both lecturer and student imperceptible (Le Grange 2014:1292, cited in Le Grange 2016b:33).

Performative  words,  such  as  aims  and  objectives,  outcomes, curriculum development, curriculum implementation, constructive alignment,  sequencing  and  pacing,  are  part  of  instrumentalist language.  The  effects  of  instrumental  rationality  are  particularly dangerous because they are colonising, homogenising, dehumanising,  domesticating,  etc.  (for  detail,  see  Le  Grange 2014,  2016a;  cited  in  2016b:33).  Curriculum  becomes  moribund and pedagogy banal. Pedagogy becomes cold and heartless, and the  Earth  becomes  a  stage  on  which  pedagogy  is  performed. Furthermore, multiple pathways (that exist prior to human thought) for transforming the world, and for creating alternative futures, are reduced to a single way of knowing, being and becoming.

Bobby  Shew's  (in  Pinar  &amp;  Irwin  2004:n.p.)  reply  to  Aoki's question, 'when does an instrument cease to be an instrument?', is worth returning to. I specifically refer to Shew's response, 'the trumpet,  music,  and  body  must  become  as  one  in  a  living wholeness' (in Pinar &amp; Irwin 2004:n.p.). In other words, trumpet, music,  and  body  become  imperceptible.  However,  I  wish  to extend Shew's insight beyond the human and the instruments or artefacts he or she produces to a post-anthropocentric idea that includes  oneness  with  the  Earth.  By  doing  so,  the  subject  of education  (that  is,  post-anthropocentric)  is  not  an  atomised individual but is ecological, embedded in and embodied by the material flows of the Earth or cosmos, constitutive of these flows, making the subject imperceptible. According to Le Grange (2012), this idea is captured in the Shona construct, ukama , which means relatedness  of everything  in the cosmos.  Aoki's  notion  of improvisation could also be expanded not only to be concerned with the human that reverberates from within and is animated but also to include the vibrations of the Earth, its flows, rhythms and creative intensities.

Aoki (in Pinar &amp; Irwin 2004:373, cited in Le Grange 2016b:34) argues that the instrumental language in curriculum privileges the visual ( videre ) because this approach to curriculum is based on the Natural Sciences, where observation is privileged.  Aoki argues for the importance of hearing or listening ( sonare ), that we need to hear the words of the instrumental language, which dominates discourses on schooling so that these performative words and the instrumental language in which they are couched can be transcended. Transcending instrumental language is the starting  point  for  a  decolonised  curriculum.  Moreover,  Aoki suggests  'what'  we  might  listen  to  by  quoting  Heidegger,  'we have  ears  because  we  are  hearkening,  and  by  way  of  this heedfulness, we are allowed to listen to the Song of the Earth' (in  Pinar  &amp;  Irwin  2004:375).  I  wish  to  add  that  we  also  need to feel ( sentire ) the Earth - the effects of its material flows and its creative intensities.

## Summary

There is a renewed interest in decolonisation in South Africa in the wake of the student protests of 2015 and 2016. Following the protests we witnessed, review committees were established at universities to investigate ways in which the curriculum could be decolonised. We also witnessed several conferences organised with the theme of decolonisation, special issues of journals with decolonisation as the theme and a burgeoning body of literature on the topic. In this chapter, I clarify what is meant by the concepts of decolonisation and curriculum. I discuss the different voices on decolonisation of the curriculum in South Africa, including voices of  the  past,  different  voices  of  the  present,  voices  that  are dominant and voices that are silenced in the debate. I conclude that decolonising the curriculum requires a radical rethinking of the concept of curriculum, so that it is liberated from instrumentalist or performative language  by introducing a language of improvisation.

## Introduction: Can the phoenix rise from the ashes?

As an emerging economy, South Africa needs to be internationally competitive;  this  dictates  that  the  country  should  produce innovative  scientists  and  engineers.  Good  Mathematics  and Science  teaching  and  learning  are  a sine  qua  non for  global competitiveness. Unfortunately, South Africa performs dismally in international benchmark tests, such as the TIMSS (Alex &amp; Juan 2016;  De  Beer  2016).  There  are  many  reasons  for  this  poor performance of learners in Science and Mathematics. Two of the reasons are the quality of teachers and the problems with the curriculum (Bernstein 2011; De Beer 2016).

Researchers such as De Beer and Petersen (2016) indicate that the school science curriculum is often not relevant to the local context. Consequently, learners are not inspired by the curriculum themes.  In  addition,  many  classrooms  today  are  characterised by  transmission-mode  (chalk-and-talk)  approaches,  and  this often nurtures reproductive behaviour and shallow learning. In many classrooms, learners are primarily prepared for summative tests and examinations, which favour the memorisation of facts. In  the  process,  the  acquisition  of  21st-century  skills  such  as communication, critical thinking, creativity and collaboration is marginalised.

For  the  phoenix  to  rise  from  the  ashes,  firstly,  we  have  to promote Self-directed Learning (SDL) among both teachers and learners. Secondly, we have to assist teachers in their professional development to enable them to better contextualise curriculum themes for  learners  by,  among  others,  facilitating  an  epistemological border-crossing between IK and the science curriculum.

In  this  chapter,  the  authors  focus  on  a  SLP  for  teachers,  in which IK is used as a vehicle to promote SDL. This context serves to illustrate the utility value of CHAT as a research lens. A CHAT lens was used to look at research data collected in two provinces in South Africa, namely, Limpopo and the Northern Cape province.

## The context of this research: Scaffolding teachers' learning and professional development to enhance self-directed learning

There are a number of perennial problems that plague teacher professional development in South Africa. As mentioned above, school  education  in  South  Africa  is  often  characterised  by transmission-mode teaching and learning. The key to addressing this is teacher  professional  development  (McKinsey  Report 2007).  This  report  clearly  states  that  'the  main  driver  of  the variation  in  student  learning  at  school  is  the  quality  of  the teachers'  (McKinsey  Report  2007:15).  Osamwonyi  (2016:84) provides  a  compelling  argument  for  the  importance  of  the professional development of teachers. Two of the reasons given for the importance of in-service teacher education are:

- · According to Kpangham (1992) and Osamwonyi (2016), teachers are members of an under-educated profession. Furthermore, the conditions under which teachers work do not promote the type of  peer  interaction,  or  the  establishment  of  communities  of practice, that could support individual teachers in their professional development in order to improve their performance.
- · There is a growing expectation 'that teachers should reform their own practices, as this is the only way in which meaningful curriculum development could take place in the daily routine of classrooms' (Osamwonyi 2016:84).

Bernstein  (2011:22-23)  refers  to  Rollnick  and  Brodie's  (2011) principles  for  effective  professional  development  programmes that could overcome the inherent problems in many in-service training programmes. These include the following:

- · Workshop-type disjointed professional development, which is dominant in South Africa, is not effective.
- · A  focus  on  a  number  of  instructional  priorities  over  a  long period of time is most effective.
- · Teachers learn best within communities of practice, with the support of 'critical friends'.

- · Quality professional development programmes immerse teacher participants in enquiry and PBL.

De Beer and Kriek (n.d.) add three additional criteria for successful teacher professional development programmes, namely:

- · Quality teacher professional development programmes should be underpinned by a sound theoretical framework.
- · Self-directed learning should be promoted during professional development.
- · Other  partners  and  stakeholders  need  to  join  hands  with teacher education institutions in facilitating effective teacher professional development.

Guided  by  these principles, NWU  developed  a  SLP  for science  teachers  to  scaffold  their  learning  and  enable  them to facilitate epistemological border-crossing between IK and science,  because  as  Vygotskyan  scholars  we  believe  that learning leads to development.

This SLP was underpinned by a social-constructivist theoretical framework, namely, scaffolding teacher learning across the 'zone of proximal teacher development' (ZPTD) (Warford 2011). Warford applied Vygotsky's (1986) well-known construct of the 'zone  of  proximal  development'  (ZPD)  to  teacher  education. He  then  showed  how  teachers'  learning  could  be  scaffolded across the ZPTD - from their actual to their potential development through four stages. These four stages, shown in Table 3.1, were used  during  the  conceptualisation  of  this  SLP.  The  stages  are self-assistance, expert-other assistance, internalisation and recursion (Warford 2011:254).

The  scaffolding  of  teachers'  learning  during  the  SLP  was focussed on the enhancement of their SDL in order for them to implement what they had learnt, to apply the new knowledge and skills in different situations, and to think creatively about new active learning strategies for their classes. They should have been equipped with skills to be lifelong learners - willing to learn more, experiment with new teaching strategies and constantly develop new ideas to motivate learners.

| ZPTD Stage               | How this was addressed during the SLP                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Self-assistance          | It was deemed crucial first to establish what knowledge and  preconceived ideas teachers held, for example, by completing a  questionnaire and group discussion. This stage provided an opportunity  for teachers to identify personal problems experienced in their teaching  and to set their own learning goals accordingly. It also provided  the teacher educator with insights into the beliefs and practices  that teachers brought with them into the professional development  programme.                                                                         |
| Expert-other  assistance | During the SLP, teachers' learning was scaffolded through PBL and CL  methods, as strategies to achieve their learning goals. For instance,  teachers engaged in laboratory techniques to test the antimicrobial  activity of medicinal plants. Apart from facilitator assistance, peer  mentoring also occurred. The focus was on 'field-based demonstrations  of how innovative teaching practices are carried out in actual classrooms'  (Warford 2011:254).                                                                                                            |
| Internalisation          | In a Vygotskyan parlance, learning first occurs on a social plane (CL  during the SLP) and then on an internal plane, through internalisation.  Participating teachers were required to reflect and keep a journal.  Sometime after the SLP, they were expected to provide an evidence- based portfolio in order to show the achievement of their learning goals.  The reason was to ensure that teachers did not simply abandon the new  skills or strategies that they were exposed to 'for what they perceive as  the real world of teaching' (Warford 2011:255).       |
| Recursion                | Warford (2011:255) describes this phase as the 'theory into practice  stage, where the dichotomy of theory and practice is confronted in all its  intensity' [slightly paraphrased]. Here the teachers needed to illustrate  some equilibrium, namely, that new concepts had been accommodated  into conceptual understanding in order to solve their identified problems.  The portfolios were designed to provide teachers the opportunity to  showcase their reformed teaching practices, for example, by providing  lesson plans and reflections on presented lessons. |

## Self-directed learning as part of the professional development of teachers

Self-directed learning, where the learners take responsibility for their own learning, became a popular term worldwide to replace education systems that emphasised teacher-centred approaches, memorisation  and  rote  learning,  which  do  not  foster  student attributes needed for the 21st century.

To change an education system (such as the one in South Africa) where  teachers  rely  mainly  on  teacher-centred  teaching-andlearning  strategies,  it  is  necessary  to  first  change  teachers'  established practices through professional development SLPs. According to Knowles (1975), self-directed learners have the urge to grow, and that  is  exactly  what  we  wanted  teachers  to  achieve  during  the professional development SLPs. We wanted them to grow as selfdirected learners who can identify their own learning needs and, accordingly, formulate learning goals that they wish to achieve. In addition, these teachers should be capable of finding their own learning resources to achieve their goals. These resources could be other teachers, Internet materials,  knowledgeable people in the community or any other source. Teachers need to have the skills to select  appropriate  learning  strategies  to  satisfy  their  learning needs according to the available information and resources. Lastly, they need evaluation skills to determine if their selection indeed satisfies their learning needs. This process, according to Knowles (1975), is what SDL is all about.

Long and Associates (2000) identify four different conceptualisations  of  SDL,  which  can  shed  more  light  on the  definition  of  SDL.  Only  one  of  these  conceptualisations, the  psychological  conceptualisation,  addresses  the  internal processes related to SDL. These authors explain three primary dimensions (motivation, metacognition and self-regulation) and four  secondary  dimensions  (choice,  competence,  control  and confidence), which are part of a psychological conceptualisation of SDL. Long  and  Associates (2000)  also indicate how any  learners,  whether  they  are  part  of  a  group  or  working individually,  need  to  employ  these  different  dimensions  in order to engage in SDL. Before teachers can foster SDL in their students, they actually need to become self-directed learners themselves, skilfully employing the different dimensions in their own learning.

Vygotsky's ZPD, and especially Warford's ZPTD, formed the framework of the SLPs (Table 3.1). This framework is well aligned with Knowles's (1975; Warford 2011:254) views on SDL - as well as

Long's (2000) primary and secondary dimensions - as it promotes teachers':

[ C ]hoice(s) in determining the course of their own growth, it motivates them  to  think  creatively  about  active  learning  strategies  and  it fosters intentional reflection on the learning situation. The more they experience success with active learning strategies the more they gain confidence in their practices. The tools should aid them in identifying, planning, selecting, designing, analysing, and reflecting. (p. 18)

According to Guglielmino's (1978:73) Delphi survey results, selfdirected  learners  are  persistent  in  learning,  view  problems  as challenges, have a strong desire to learn, are always curious to learn more, and are goal-directed - to name a few characteristics. The  SLPs  for  professional  development  of  teachers  should specifically aim to foster a desire to learn and to develop new student-centred  active  learning  strategies.  The  aim  is  not  to simply learn one or two strategies to replace the old teachercentred strategies,  but  to  improvise  and  develop  new  creative strategies  and  to  realise  that  there  is  a  plethora  of  ideas  for keeping students actively involved in their own learning.

When  developing a professional development SLP for teachers,  which  aims  to  foster  SDL,  the  developers  should constantly plan to achieve SDL characteristics among teachers. A paradigm shift from transmission-mode teaching and learning to  SDL  is  needed,  where  teachers  are  willing  to  take  up  their responsibility as self-directed educators and constantly look for new and innovative ideas to get learners actively involved in their own  learning.  This  professional  development  should  not  only better  prepare  teachers  for  their  future  role  as  self-directed educators but also equip them to foster SDL among learners.

Professional development courses for teachers should create a  climate  that  promotes SDL and develops teachers' ability to steer further learning on their own. They should continuously be able to identify their own challenges in the classroom, set their own  professional  development  goals  accordingly,  identify  or improvise  the  necessary  resources,  implement  the  appropriate strategies,  and  critically  reflect  on  and  evaluate  the  process.

In doing so, they will also realise the advantages of this process for  their  learners  (De  Beer  &amp;  Mentz  2017).  These  SLPs  should provide  teachers  with  opportunities  to  engage  in  their  own learning and eventually feel confident about their own learning.

## Cultural-Historical Activity Theory as a research lens

Cultural-Historical Activity Theory has its roots in social constructivism,  and  its  development  as  a  research  lens  was predominantly influenced by the work of Lev Vygotsky. Vygotsky (1978)  emphasised  the  role  of  psychological  tools  and  signs (e.g. language) in teaching and learning. Third-generation CHAT is  a  practical  research  tool  that  can  assist  the  researcher  in interpreting  data  embedded  in  specific  cultural  and  historical contexts.  This  provides  researchers  the  opportunity  to  better compare  research  findings  from  different  contexts,  as  CHAT clearly  shows  the  similarities  and  differences  that  characterise different research studies (as will be illustrated in this chapter).

Cultural-Historical Activity Theory has become popular as a research lens owing to, among others, its flexibility (Mentz &amp; De Beer  2017).  Rogoff  (1995)  alerted  researchers  to  the  fact  that CHAT can be used on three different levels:

- 1. on a personal level or plane, where the focus is on the activity of an individual (the 'subject' in the activity system)
- 2.  on  an  interpersonal plane, where more than one 'subject' is present,  for example,  the  interplay  between  a  teacher's teaching activities and a student's learning (with the teacher and learner as the two 'subjects' in the activity system)
- 3.  on an institutional plane, where the focus is on a phenomenon (as the 'subject') and not on a real person.

An example of the latter is  the  use  of  'Indigenous  Knowledge Systems'  and  'school  science  teaching'  as  the  'subjects'  of  an activity  system  (De  Beer  &amp;  Mentz  2017).  Beatty  and  Feldman (2012) indicate that CHAT is, therefore, a versatile tool that can

be used in different ways. However, the criteria for a particular use of CHAT should be well explained and consistently applied. Figure 3.1 to Figure 3.4 illustrate the use of CHAT in these three contexts.

In  Figure  3.2,  Beatty  and  Feldman  look  at  the  interaction between the teacher (the 'subject') and the learner (the 'object') in an activity system (e.g. the classroom). We are of the opinion that  comparing  two  interdependent  activity  systems,  in  which the teacher is the 'subject' in one activity system and the learner is  the  'subject'  in  the  other  activity  system,  gives  a  far  more nuanced  perspective  on  the  realisation  of  the  'object'  in  the

Note: The 'subject' in Figure 3.1 is the science teacher, and the 'object' is his or her professional development. 'Tools' include SLPs, professional development workshops, resources (e.g. books and knowledgeable people) and reflection. 'Rules' refer to institutional rules (e.g. university admission criteria for SLPs), guidelines for effective reflection, assessment, etc. The 'community' constitutes stakeholders such as subject advisors or school management (e.g. how supportive is school leadership of professional development activities for teachers). The 'division of labour' refers to the different roles of the teacher, for example, the teacher as a facilitator of learning, the teacher as an agent of change, the teacher as a self-directed learner or the teacher as a reflective practitioner.

activity  system  (Figure  3.3).  Beatty  and  Feldman's  approach does not make provision for a nuanced analysis of the teacher and learners' use of 'tools' or the different perspectives on 'rules' and 'division of labour'.

In the activity system on the left, the 'subject' is the teacher. The learner constitutes the 'subject' in the right-hand activity system. This, more nuanced, CHAT perspective on an interpersonal plane highlights the so-called 'contradiction of control'. While the teacher might plan to promote SDL in the classroom ('object' in the activity system on the left), the learners might work towards an 'object' of passing the examination (activity system on the right).

In Figure 3.4, the 'subject' is not a person, but an entity or a construct. In this figure, the respective 'subjects' are SDL (activity system  on  the  left)  and  IKS  (activity  system  on  the  right). There  is  a  shared  'object'  between  SDL  and  IK,  namely,  the development of skills to sustain meaningful learning. The 'object' in the case of SDL (activity system on the left) is the development of  21st-century  skills.  The  'object'  in  the  case  of  IKS  (activity system  on  the  right)  is  to  provide  holders  of  IK  with  skills  to survive.

Later in this chapter, we refer to 'tensions' that arise in an activity system. However, the purpose of Figure 3.1 to Figure 3.4 is  to  illustrate  the  different  contexts  in  which  CHAT  can  be used, and not to analyse specific data or to identify 'tensions'.

The  unit  of  analysis  in  CHAT  is  always  human  behaviour within a given context and demarcated by an activity system. Engeström (1987) coined the construct  'activity  system'.  This construct can assist a researcher in understanding how people are embedded  within  a  sociocultural  context,  which  they continuously  interact  with.  A  classroom  could,  for  example, serve  as  an  activity  system.  Likewise,  young  people  learning about their IK in an authentic setting can also be viewed as an activity system.

## The Vygotskyan scholar Luria (1981) explained that:

[ ]n order to explain the highly complex forms of human consciousness I one must go beyond the human organism. One must seek the origins of conscious activity […] in the social and historical forms of human existence. (p. 25)

Within an activity system (Figure 3.1), there is always a 'subject', for example, the Natural Science teacher; an 'object', which is the goal  of  the  activity,  for  example,  the  teacher's  professional development  and  SDL  enhancement;  'tools'  that  facilitate  the realisation  of  the  'object',  for  example,  the  pedagogy  used  to promote contextualised PBL and CL in the science classroom; 'rules'  at  play  in  the  activity  system,  for  example,  curriculum guidelines or epistemological perspectives; a 'community' (all stakeholders involved in the activity system who might either support or prevent the 'object'  from  being  achieved);  and  the 'division of labour' (the different roles played by the protagonist or subject).

Worldwide, many researchers use CHAT as a research lens. However,  CHAT  is  especially  valuable  in  complex  situations, where  several  cultural  and  historical  factors  are  at  play.  De Oliveira and Rego (2010) show how activity theorists, such as Luria, worked in contexts that were characterised by complexity

and  transformation.  Cultural-Historical  Activity  Theory  was developed  during  the  Russian  Revolution,  a  period  when  'an entire generation was infused with the energy of revolutionary change' (De Oliveira &amp; Rego 2010:4). The researchers Luria and his  colleagues  often  worked  with  marginalised  groups  in  the community. Cultural-Historical Activity Theory is thus an appropriate lens to use when  researching South African education, which has been characterised by constant transformation since the birth of democracy in 1994. In a country where social justice issues are paramount, CHAT as a lens has the potential to provide insight into complex activity systems. Cultural-Historical  Activity  Theory  is,  therefore,  very  much applicable to the context  of IK research, as IK is often marginalised  owing  to  the  educational  focus  on  universal Western knowledge. An example that illustrates this statement is that, under the apartheid regime in South Africa, all forms of divination were outlawed under the Suppression of Witchcraft Act of 1957. Divination is at the heart of many healing practices in Africa (Ashforth 2005; De Beer &amp; Whitlock 2009).

Engeström (2009) makes it clear that a researcher should always take two interdependent activity systems as the minimal unit of analysis. The researcher will thus juxtapose two activity systems,  focussing  specifically  on  the  'objects'  of  the  two activity systems. Literature shows that the 'object' is normally surrounded  by  complexity,  and  McNeil  (2013)  speaks  of  a 'contradiction  of  control'.  In  this  chapter,  CHAT  is  used  as  a research lens to juxtapose two activity systems, that is, teacher professional development interventions in the Limpopo Province  and  the  Northern  Cape  Province  of  South  Africa, respectively (Figure 3.5). This chapter claims that the complexity  surrounding  the  'objects'  of  two  interdependent activity systems is, to a large extent, influenced by the 'rules', 'tools'  and  'division  of  labour'  nodes  in  the  activity  systems, and that an analysis of these nodes could shed light on the 'contradiction of control' that often influences the realisation of the 'object'.

## Background to the Limpopo and Northern Cape interventions

This  is  a  DBR  project.  In  subsequent  chapters,  data  will  be shared on the SLPs in which STEM teachers engaged with IK. Chapter 5 deals with Natural Sciences, Chapter 6 with Mathematics and Chapter 7 with technology. However, the focus of this chapter is on the use of CHAT as a research lens, as CHAT will also be used as a research lens in other chapters. Sari and Herrington (2013:122) argue that DBR allows the researcher to focus  on  complex  problems  and,  from  the  data,  distil  design

principles to improve an intervention. Design-based research is, therefore, characterised by a long-term  engagement  that involves  intensive  collaboration.  In  this  specific  context,  DBR allows  for  continuous  improvement  of  the  SLPs,  where  data obtained  after  a  SLP  assist  the  facilitators  in  distilling  new design principles and redesigning future SLPs in order to better serve the teachers' needs and achieve the outcomes.

## The Limpopo intervention (Cycle 1 in this design-based research)

In  2016,  a  three-day  SLP  was  presented  to  62  Life  Sciences teachers in Polokwane in the Limpopo province. The aim of the SLP was to provide teachers with a better understanding of how the curriculum could be made more relevant to diverse learners  by  infusing  cultural  (indigenous)  knowledge  into curriculum themes. 5  We were mindful of depicting the shared tenets of both science and IK in the SLP, so that teachers could better  facilitate  such  border-crossing  in  their  classrooms. Cronje, De Beer and Ankiewicz (2015:323-324) show that both the Natural Sciences and IK share tenets such as their empirical, tentative  and  inferential  nature.  Underpinning  IKS  are  two important  considerations.  Firstly,  De  Beer  and  Mentz  (2017) show that many holders of IK were (and still are) self-directed learners who  need  to solve complex  problems  in their immediate  environments,  often  to  ensure  survival  (Ch.  3). Problem-based (inquiry) learning is, therefore, a shared characteristic  of  both  science  and  IK  and  was,  therefore, emphasised during the SLP.

Secondly, IK is collective knowledge, and Jautse, Thambe and De Beer (2016) show that CL is an appropriate strategy to facilitate IK as it honours its syntactical nature. Thus, teachers explored the antimicrobial qualities of medicinal plants in the laboratory using an

adapted Kirby-Bauer technique (Mitchell &amp; Cater 2000), working in small groups of four teachers. Examples from mostly Khoi-san origin were used as illustration. The learning task was conceptualised being mindful of providing teachers with the opportunity to set 'driving questions'  themselves  (Krajcik  &amp;  Shin  2016),  which  would  guide their inquiry. The five basic principles for CL that were identified by Johnson, Johnson and Smith (1998), and Johnson and Johnson (2014), namely, positive interdependence among group members, face-to-face promotive interaction, individual accountability, interpersonal small-group skills and group processing, were implemented. Apart from engaging in the laboratory task, teachers (within  their  groups)  had  to  plan  lessons,  which  formed  part  of the portfolios that they needed to submit within six months after completion of the SLP. The aim was to provide not only a once-off training opportunity but also to allow teachers to grow and reflect on their experiences. They had to think creatively about how they would address other sections of the CAPS in similarly innovative ways  in  order  to  actively  engage  learners  in  their  learning.  For example,  teachers  had  to  provide  lesson  plans  in  the  portfolios that addressed IK by making use of CL or PBL. These portfolios were assessed, and teachers received feedback after submission. Furthermore, presenters of the SLPs visited these teachers after a period of six months to follow up with ideas and guide them in their efforts to become self-directed teachers.

## The Northern Cape intervention (Cycle 2 in this design-based research)

In the second half of 2017, Cycle 2 of the DBR started, with a SLP in Calvinia in the Northern Cape. 6  Thirty-seven Life and Natural Sciences teachers participated in this intervention. The same examples from the Khoi-san culture, as mentioned in the Limpopo intervention, were used. Teachers were afforded six months after the course to submit

their  portfolio,  which  was  similar  to  the  Limpopo  portfolio  assignment, but with greater emphasis on Classroom Action Research (CAR). This was done in an attempt to enhance the development of reflective skills  among  teachers  -  a  design  principle  that  was  distilled  in response to the poor and superficial evidence of reflective practice in  the  Limpopo  portfolios.  Mettetal  (2002)  describes  CAR  as  a midpoint  between  teacher  reflection  and  traditional  educational research. Gravett and De Beer (2015) emphasise that CAR is more data-based and systematic than reflection but also less formal and controlled than normal educational research.

## Research methods

As mentioned earlier, this chapter focuses on the use of CHAT as a lens  in  researching  the  professional  development  of  science teachers  and  their  ability  to  facilitate  epistemological  bordercrossing between IK and the Western science curricula. A gap that was identified in the research literature was that little has been published on the 'rules', 'tools' and 'division of labour' nodes in an activity system. Therefore, the research question that guided this chapter was: How can the 'rules', 'tools' and 'division of labour' nodes within two activity systems provide better insight into the 'contradiction of control' that often characterises activity systems?.

Based on earlier work (Mentz &amp; De Beer 2017), the authors used  third-generation  CHAT  as  a  lens  to  view  two  teacher professional  development  interventions  in  the  Limpopo  and Northern Cape provinces of South Africa, respectively. The two activity systems juxtaposed in Figure 3.5 are:

- 1. the  2-day  SLP  offered  to  teachers  when  the  interventions commenced
- 2.  teachers' individual classroom experiences after the intervention.

The  focus  was  on  the  transfer  that  took  place  after  the  SLPs (Figure 3.6). In each of these two figures, the two activity systems compared are the Limpopo SLP (on the left-hand side) and the

FIGURE 3.6: Cultural-Historical Activity Theory used as a lens to study the post-intervention transfer to classrooms in Limpopo (left) and the Northern Cape (right).

Northern Cape SLP (on the right-hand side) after a number of new design principles  were  implemented.  Data  were  collected through  the  analysis  of  teacher  portfolios  (with  lesson  plans), individual  and  focus  group  interviews  with  teachers  and  the analysis of artefacts (e.g. learner assignments). Emerging themes were identified, which were further analysed using a CHAT lens.

## Findings

The findings in this section are reported on in the following manner: we start by briefly explaining the major trends emerging from the intervention data in the Limpopo and Northern Cape provinces. Cultural-Historical Activity Theory was used to interpret the data from Cycle 1 (after the Limpopo intervention). These insights were then used to  revise  the  SLP  for  Cycle  2  (Northern  Cape  intervention). Teachers participating in the SLP in the Northern Cape benefitted,  therefore,  from  the  predictive  value  of  CHAT.  We then  juxtaposed  the  two  activity  systems  and,  by  using  CHAT, distilled a number of emerging themes. These insights will dictate future interventions, as we claim that CHAT holds predictive value.

## The Limpopo short learning programme (Cycle 1)

## Disappointing portfolios

Despite the very positive feedback from the teachers after the SLP,  we  were  disappointed  by  many  of  the  portfolios  that  we received  back.  It  was  also  disconcerting  that  the  majority  of teachers did not submit their portfolios within six months after completion of the SLP. Only 24 of the 62 teachers (39%) qualified for  certificates.  Of  these  teachers,  seven  obtained  distinctions, and these teachers' portfolios provided very good evidence of creative transfer of newly acquired knowledge and skills into the classroom. The other 17 portfolios were a mixed-bag in terms of quality: six portfolios included lesson plans that provided evidence of sound PBL and CL, and included IK in an authentic way.

The  other  11  portfolios  provided  evidence  of  what  Warford (2011:255) describes as 'discard(ing) the academy for what they perceive as the real world of teaching'. Zeichner and Tabachnick (1981:7) speak of the 'wash-out' effect; 'newly acquired knowledge and  skills  obtained  during  teacher  education  programmes  are often 'washed out' at the coalface of teaching in the classroom'.

## Research sub-themes that emerged from the portfolios and interviews with Limpopo teachers

The SLP facilitators were very disappointed with the relatively poor  quality  of  portfolios  submitted  by  teachers  from  the Limpopo  intervention.  The  following  excerpt  from  one  of  the submitted portfolios illustrates the underdeveloped subject and pedagogical  knowledge  of  the  teacher,  as  well  as  the  lack  of knowledge  of  basic laboratory equipment  and  procedures (Table 3.2).

Most of the personal interviews that were conducted indicated that the  teachers  needed  more  guidance  and  professional development  to  effectively  incorporate  IK  in  their  classrooms. One of the teachers commented, '[w]ith IKS we have to go out to museums or IK practitioners, and if I go away for the day the learners that stay here don't have guidance' (teacher responses,

date  unknown,  location  unknown).  As  most  science  teachers were never trained in epistemological border-crossing between science and IK, many of them resort to excursions with learners, such as a day-trip to a relevant museum, but this creates problems, such as classes that are cancelled at school.

Another problem that was flagged by the teachers was the full curriculum and lack of time to engage learners in inquiry learning, as can be seen from the following comment:

'There  is  a  lot  of  content  and  they  [ Department  of  Education ] increased it'; 'I was so inspired by what we have learned in the short course, but I am afraid that I will not have enough time to do it in my classroom. The test on muthi plants takes a lot of time, and I have to keep to the pace setter'. (Teacher responses, date unknown, location unknown)

The data obtained from the portfolios and personal interviews indicate the need for more systemic and longitudinal solutions, involving  the  Department  of  Basic  Education  in  collaboration with  training  institutions,  to  support  continuous  professional development in the form of regular visits, organising communities of  practice,  and  assisting  teachers  to  obtain  learning  materials where Internet connections are not available.

## Design principles that were distilled from the data

In true DBR fashion, we made changes to the SLPs to address problems that were identified. The data prompted the researchers to  revisit  the  SLP,  and  to  redesign  the  SLP  to  try  and  ensure better transfer to the classroom. Of particular concern was the fact that many teachers did not submit their portfolios, despite several  reminders  from  the  university.  A  number  of  design principles were distilled in Cycle 1, which informed the second cycle (Northern Cape). These design principles included:

- · We realised that teachers in rural Limpopo schools do not often enjoy the benefit of supportive communities of practice that  scaffold  their  learning  and  professional  development.

After the three-day SLP offered in Limpopo, teachers did not receive  much  support  from  the  facilitators  as  we  were awaiting their portfolios. Only when we received the portfolios, months later, did we become aware of the challenges that these teachers faced. It was realised that these teachers were in need of an online Community of Practice (CoP) whereby they  could  engage  in  peer  mentoring.  It  was  also  realised that a closer liaison with the Department of Basic Education was  essential  in  order  to  provide  the  necessary  follow-up support.

- · In  at  least  60%  of  the  portfolios,  teachers  either  did  not provide any reflections on their lessons or they provided very superficial or naïve reflections. A number of teachers provided lesson  plans  that  showed  transmission-mode  approaches (chalk-and-talk),  yet  the  teachers  would  reflect  that  the lesson was very successful and that it engaged learners and provided them with a better understanding of the NOS. The facilitators made  an  incorrect  assumption  prior  to  the Limpopo  SLP,  that  is,  that  these  teachers  were  reflective practitioners. Because of this assumption, very little time was devoted to reflection during the SLP. A design principle that was distilled from the Limpopo data was that more attention should be given to critical reflective practice during the SLP. One  way  of  doing  this  would  be  to  empower  teachers  to participate  in  CAR  -  a  strategy  that  was  implemented  in Cycle 2.
- · Despite the fact that teachers in Limpopo were shown the benefits of 'frugal science' (Ahuja 2014; Jackson, De Beer &amp; White  2018),  an  approach  using  cheap  and  accessible scientific tools in under-resourced classrooms (also known as 'science-on-a-shoestring'), we saw very little evidence in the portfolios of frugal-science improvisation. One reason could be that the facilitators provided answers to questions that the teachers themselves had not yet asked. A far better approach would have been to base a frugal-science activity on the teachers' everyday experiences of teaching science in an under-resourced classroom and then letting them set development goals for themselves. Another design principle that was distilled was the need to encourage such teacher

agency during the SLP in order to enable teachers to devise such  materials  and  approaches,  and  to  transfer  this  new knowledge to different situations. However, this approach would have to be contextualised in terms of the teachers' own needs, and that they themselves should identify this as a learning goal.

- · Teachers  commented  in  their  portfolios,  and  during  the personal interviews, that the SLP did not equip them for the wide learner diversity in their classrooms. Teachers reflected on the cultural diversity in their classrooms (Bapedi, Batswana and Vhavenda, among others), yet most of the examples used during  the  SLP  were  (unfamiliar)  Khoi-san  in  nature.  Two design principles emerged from this realisation. Firstly, more relevant examples should be provided during the SLPs, taking local context  into consideration. Secondly,  although  the facilitators and researchers thought that it was clear that the central premise of the SLP was that teachers should behave as self-directed learners and learn more about specific cultural groups  present  in  their  classrooms,  this  was  not  the  case. Another design principle identified was, therefore, to explicitly discuss SDL during the SLP.

## The Northern Cape short learning programme (Cycle 2)

## An emphasis on project-based learning and classroom action research

Based on the insights gained from Cycle 1, the SLP was amended to incorporate the above-mentioned design principles. An important lesson  learnt  during  the  Limpopo  intervention  was  not  to  make assumptions  about  the  knowledge  and  skills  of  participating teachers. In an attempt to address the problems of lack of inquiry learning  and  lack  of  teacher  reflection  displayed  in  many  of  the Limpopo portfolios, project-based learning and CAR were prioritised during the SLP in Cycle 2. The basic principles that were emphasised during the SLP in Cycle 2 are summarised in Table 3.3.

| Teachers were introduced to the six  key features of project-based learning,  as explained by Krajcik and Shin (2016:  275-276):                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Teachers were introduced to the steps in  CAR, as described by Gravett and De Beer  (2015:347):                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

The teacher should identify a problem and  formulate a research question. 2.   The teacher should plan an intervention or  lesson or approach as a possible solution  to the above problem. 3.   The teacher should act and collect data  (evidence). 4.   The teacher should analyse the data. 5.   The intervention (project or lesson) should  be evaluated in order to determine whether  the problem was addressed/research  question answered. |
| Teachers could plan and implement  any project in their classrooms. As the  ethnobotanical survey was discussed  during the SLP, the majority of teachers  implemented such project-based learning  interventions. However, teachers also  identified several highly relevant projects,  for example, a project on water quality in  an area that faced a devastating drought.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Teachers were encouraged to formulate  research questions such as, 'What are  learners' experiences of engaging in project- based learning?', focussing, therefore, mostly  on affective factors such as student interest.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

## Portfolios provided evidence of reflective practice, and there were good examples of effective incorporation of indigenous knowledge into science themes

Many  of  the  Northern  Cape  portfolios  provided  evidence  of effective incorporation of IK into CAPS themes. Table 3.4 provides an example in which a teacher in Calvinia contextualised DNA technology.

| Introduction I will ask learners to provide examples of how  DNA technology finds application in our everyday  lives.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Learners will discuss the application  of DNA technology in small groups.  Learners will be encouraged to Google  information on their cell phones. After  10 min, groups will provide feedback. |
| Consolidation of learners' feedback Based on learners' feedback, I will provide a short  overview of the application of DNA technology  (e.g. DNA Barcoding), such as the authentication  of medicinal and herbal products, invasive and  alien species, and wildlife crime.                                                                                                                               | A question-and-answer session, in  which learners will be allowed to think  of examples of these applications, for  example, instances of wildlife crimes  like rhino pouching.                  |
| Contextualising the lab activity : I will provide the following background to this  lab: From time to time, patients die when they  take the medicines given to them by traditional  healers. It is, therefore, necessary to sometimes  do DNA Barcoding, to determine what plant-  and animal species were used in making these  traditional medicines. Today, we are going to  extract DNA from bananas. |                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Lab: Extracting DNA from bananas I will utilise a 'shoestring-approach', where  learners will extract DNA from plant materials  such as bananas. Note by the authors:  The teacher then explains the                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Learners engage in practical work in  the laboratory.                                                                                                                                            |
| Lab report (assessment) Learners will be asked to do the lab report in a  different way, namely, in the form of an article for  a scientific journal.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Learners are asked to first study a few  examples of journal articles, and they  then, in their small groups, need to  plan and write an article.                                                |

Another  example  of  the  effective  incorporation  of  IK  into curriculum themes is a lesson and practical activity on making boerseep (traditional  soap)  that  was  included  in  one  of  the portfolios. The teacher concluded:

My research led me to uncover that in the olden days Asbos (a Karoo vygie)  was  burned  to  get  loog  (lye)  and  this  was  used  instead  of

caustic soda. In comparison, the method used in the olden days to make soap took at times a whole day stirring the mixture over an open  fire.  Therefore,  caustic  soda  hastens  the  process  of  making soap. (Teacher responses, date unknown, location unknown)

The  teacher  then  engaged  her  learners  in  a  practical  activity where they used caustic soda to make soap.

## nquiry learning (problem-based learning) was I more evident in the Northern Cape portfolios

Table 3.5 is an excerpt from a lesson plan that provides evidence of inquiry learning. This lesson plan served as an introduction to a learner project on conducting an ethnobotanical survey.

IK, indigenous knowledge.

## The portfolios and interviews provided evidence of self-directed learning and classroom innovation

In one of the interviews, a teacher commented on how the SLP had inspired her to do further research on the use of music to teach curriculum content. This was actually not a focus of the SLP,  and  was  merely  mentioned  in  passing,  yet  the  teacher displayed SDL:

I can read music and play the piano. I take Nicholas Louw [ a popular South  African  artist ]  songs  that  I  like,  and  then  write  lyrics  that are  relevant  to  curriculum  themes.  I  then  sing  it  in  my  lessons. This  motivates  the  learners.  (A  teacher,  gender  undisclosed,  date unknown; [ translated from Afrikaans ])

Another example of SDL was provided by a teacher who realised that  she  needed  to  improve  her  knowledge  of  local  flora.  She identified an expert (from a local farm) to scaffold her learning, and, with his help, she implemented a very successful ethnobotanical  survey  project  in  her  class.  A  third  example (emerging from a teacher's portfolio and an interview with her) was a learning activity in which learners used frugal science to learn about electricity. Learners had to build a torch light making use of cheap resources such as a toilet roll, flashlight, wire and a battery. The  teacher  commented  that  '[…]  they  were  very excited  -  they  were  actively  participating  [translated  from Afrikaans]' (teacher responses, date unknown, location unknown).

## Using Cultural-Historical Activity Theory as a lens when juxtaposing two activity systems

As mentioned, the Northern Cape teachers enjoyed the benefits of an improved SLP owing to the predictive value of CHAT. The differences  between  the  two  SLPs  are  shown  in  Figure  3.5. Although the basic structure of the two SLPs was very similar, the second SLP included a stronger focus on reflection and

engagement in CAR. Figure 3.5 shows the two activity systems, which  depict  the  Limpopo  SLP  (triangle  on  the  left)  and  the Northern Cape SLP (triangle on the right).

Based  on  the  data  obtained,  Figure  3.6  shows  two  activity systems  that  represent  classroom  transfer  after  the  SLP  in Limpopo  (left)  and  the  Northern  Cape  (right).  The  data  that informed the activity systems in Figure 3.6 came from teacher portfolios,  interviews  and  classroom  observations.  We  need  to state upfront that in both activity systems there were exceptions to the general trend, that is, a few excellent examples of reflection, inquiry learning and effective border-crossing in Limpopo classrooms,  and  teacher-dominated  'chalk-and-talk'  lessons  in the Northern Cape. However, Figure 3.6 provides an overview of the general trends observed.

Themes that emerged using this CHAT perspective are in the following sections.

## Theme 1: Local context should be taken into consideration during the short learning programmes to best serve the 'object' in the activity system

During Cycle 1 (Limpopo SLP), the facilitators used mainly Khoisan  IK  examples.  One  of  the  Limpopo  teachers  commented afterwards that 'although the course was very interesting, it did not  provide  us  with  many  examples  relevant  in  the  Limpopo province' (teacher responses, date unknown, location unknown). Such  Khoi-san  examples,  however,  were  very  relevant  in  the Northern Cape (Cycle 2), as this area was once the home of many Khoi-san people. De Beer and Van Wyk (2011) have described the rich ethnobotanical knowledge of Khoi-san descendants in the Northern Cape. De Beer and Mentz (2017) showed that school children in the region also take a keen interest in the flora. The latter authors (De Beer &amp; Mentz 2017) showed that the children especially knew the names of edible plants, which the authors explain in terms of the fact that the area is generally

socio-economically stressed and that veld food provides a means of  sustenance.  Interestingly,  older  children  had  also  started  to learn the names and uses of medicinal plants (De Beer &amp; Mentz 2017:7).  The  facilitators  realised,  therefore,  that  the  Khoi-san examples that were unfamiliar to the teachers in Limpopo would be far more appropriate and relevant to teachers (and learners) in the Northern Cape.

One of the 'rules' in the activity systems is to portray the true nature of IK. The unfortunate choice of IK examples in Cycle 1 probably contributed to the 'contradiction of control' related to the 'object' in the Limpopo activity system. A 'realised object' in activity system 1 was that only lip service was paid to IK. Lesson plans on human anatomy and physiology included examples of medicinal plants, but the true tenets of IK were not addressed. This is in stark contrast to activity system 2, where IK was better infused into classroom teaching, as shown in the example above from a Cycle 2 portfolio. This particular teacher effectively infused IK into a particularly difficult curriculum theme, namely, DNA and biotechnology.

Another portfolio example was a Calvinia teacher's learning activity on traditional soap making and her experimentation with lye made  from  the asbos ( Mesembryanthemum  junceum ). Traditionally, the asbos (a local plant) is burnt to provide alkali ash in soap making (Van Wyk &amp; Gericke 2018). However, learners discovered that caustic soda is more effective. She incorporated the tenets of science into the lesson, engaging the learners in the so-called scientific method.

## Theme 2: A greater emphasis on problem-based and project-based learning is needed during the short learning programme in order to facilitate a shift from transmissionmode teaching towards inquiry approaches

As mentioned earlier, the facilitators realised (after Cycle 1 of the DBR)  that  no  assumptions  should  be  made  about  teachers'

knowledge and skills. During Cycle 2, more focus was given to problem-based and project-based learning, and the local context was taken into consideration. This yielded good results. Although 'chalk-and-talk'  lesson  plans  were  still  evident  in  the  Northern Cape  teachers'  portfolios,  a  clear  shift  could  be  seen  towards inquiry approaches. Of the portfolios assessed, about 60% of the lesson  plans  had  authentic  elements  of  PBL.  The  example provided in Table 3.5 serves as an illustration. The Calvinia learners in  one  class  had  to  plan  an  ethnobotanical  survey,  and  their learning  was  scaffolded  using  the  article  by  De  Beer  and  Van Wyk (2011) on how to conduct ethnobotanical surveys. During this inquiry, the learners engaged in authentic science, and this led to the realisation of affective outcomes. In an interview, the teacher concerned commented:

The Grade 10 class is actually a difficult class. It was therefore amazing for me to see how the learners participated and were engaged […] they were excited about the project. (A teacher, gender undisclosed, date unknown; [ translated from Afrikaans ])

The 'realised object' in activity system 2 (Figure 3.2) included a better  incorporation  of  inquiry  (problem-based)  learning.  This was because of a focus on 'tools', that is, in the second SLP, more focus was given to PBL as compared to the first SLP. Also, the introduction  of  CAR  catapulted  the  shift  from  transmission teaching towards inquiry approaches.

## Theme 3: The development of the reflective skills of teachers should be prioritised during the short learning programmes

Although some Cycle 2 portfolios were still disappointing, owing either to the complete lack of reflection or the superficial nature of the reflection, a much larger percentage of portfolios (around 60%) provided evidence of more nuanced reflection as compared to  Cycle  1.  The  Calvinia  teacher,  who  engaged  her  learners  in ethnobotanical  surveys,  provided  a  good  example  of  critical reflection.  She  indicated  that  she  would  announce  the  project

early next year and indicated how she would approach the project differently based on her experiences. She also critically reflected on her own knowledge and skills and identified the need to learn more about the local flora. Under 'division of labour' in activity system 1, it became clear that most teachers were not reflective practitioners.  Although  the  'tools'  node  indicates  a  focus  on reflection during the SLP, this was done in a haphazard way, as the facilitators assumed that all teachers were reflective practitioners.  In  Cycle  2,  a  deliberate  attempt  was  made  to scaffold  teacher  reflection,  and  portfolios  bear  testament  to  a more nuanced reflection.

## Theme 4: Teacher engagement in classroom action research provides affordances that should be emphasised during in-service teacher education

Realising that (1) the Northern Cape community has a closer link to local flora than many other regions in the country and (2) more should be done to enhance teacher reflection, the SLP designers provided the teachers in Cycle 2 with the opportunity to engage in CAR with a focus on the affordances of project-based learning in the classroom. Although teachers could choose any project for their learners to engage in, most teachers (whose portfolios have been assessed up to this point) chose ethnobotanical surveys as a project theme.

A  number  of  the  teachers  produced  excellent  examples  of project-based  learning,  which  were  skilfully  packaged  within their CAR reports. An example of good CAR was provided by a teacher  in  one  of  the  high  schools  in  the  Hantam  region.  She wanted to determine how learners experience their engagement with  ethnobotanical  work.  She  gave  the  learners  (working  on small groups) a compulsory assignment on developing brochures for  the  different  biomes  in  South  Africa.  However,  she  also provided  her  Grade  10  learners  with  an  additional  (optional) opportunity  to  perform  an  ethnobotanical  survey  and,  to  her

surprise, many  learners  willingly participated. Her  research question focussed on learners' experiences of engaging in such activities,  and  whether  it  led  to  affective  outcomes  such  as interest in, and enjoyment of, Life Sciences. In a personal interview with the researchers, she stated:

Despite the fact that I wanted to get hysterical at times about this ethnobotany study, it was also a big highlight. The Grade 10 class is actually a difficult class […] It was amazing for me to see how they cooperate, and how they get excited about it. This gave me pleasure. (A teacher, female, date unknown; [ translated from Afrikaans ])

This  emphasis  on  CAR  and  reflection  in  activity  system  2  was one  of  the  reasons  why  there  is  better  alignment  between the 'intended object' and the 'realised object', and not the same 'contradiction of control' as in activity system 1. Once again, the 'tools' used (e.g. CAR) supported the realisation of the 'object' of the  activity. Again,  the  'division  of  labour'  highlighted  the importance of the role of the teacher as reflective practitioner.

## Theme 5: Careful consideration should be given in short learning programmes for enhancing self-directed learning

Candy (1991) is of the opinion that self-direction in learning is not necessarily  a  fixed  quality  that  exists independently  in  an individual or in a situation. He argues that it is the result of the interaction between the person and the situation. It is, therefore, essential to create a learning environment during the SLP that fosters  SDL.  Whereas  the  reflections  in  activity  system  1  were mostly  superficial (with a few  exceptions), more  nuanced reflections  characterised  the  reflections  in  the  portfolios  in activity  system 2. The following excerpt, from a reflection in a Northern Cape teacher's portfolio, shows that SDL was developed in some of the teachers:

It  is  so  essential  for  a  teacher  to  adapt  her  strategies  to  suit  the needs of learners. Today's learners have different needs from those of 21 years ago, when I started teaching. However, the danger is that a teacher gets 'stuck' in habits and ways of doing things. This short

learning programme provided new wind in my sails and a fresh outlook on teaching and learning. We have realised that the local environment (and  its  flora)  is  a  resource  that  we  need  to  tap  into,  and  that  we can  facilitate  problem-based  and  project-based  learning  with  very few resources. However, we have also realised that we are not very knowledgeable about the plants in the Hantam. We have therefore asked an expert from the farm Tierhoek to assist us in addressing this knowledge gap. (A teacher, gender undisclosed, date unknown)

Not only did this teacher formulate learning goals for herself but she also identified resources to assist herself in obtaining these learning goals.

A  more  dedicated  focus  on  strategies  and  approaches  to enhance SDL in activity system 2 is clear from the 'tools', 'rules' and the 'division of labour' nodes. More activities, such as a focus on CAR, characterised the 'tools' in activity system 2. The role of the teacher as reflective practitioner is a prominent feature of the 'division of labour'. Guidance was provided to teachers on various ways to reflect, and they were also introduced to the steps in CAR, which could be seen as 'rules'. All of these created a learning environment more conducive to the development of SDL.

## But … still back to the drawing board

Despite the positive trends in Cycle 2, as reported above, there were  still a sizeable number  of  teachers  in  the  Northern Cape cohort who did not achieve the grade (in terms of meeting the criteria for obtaining the certification). Based on the predictive value of CHAT, the SLP for Cycle 3 could be changed to better facilitate the achievement  of  the 'object'. The  CHAT  lens highlighted  a  number  of  prevailing  problems.  Even  in  Cycle  2, there  was  little  evidence  of  a  sustained  CoP.  (This  aspect  is discussed in Chapter 9, where the authors recommend an online CoP  and  blended  learning.)  Although  greater  liaison  with  the Department  of  Education  characterised  Cycle  2,  there  is  still scope for improvement. Too little was done during the SLP for teachers  to  have  sufficient  hands-on  experience  to  apply  new pedagogies to certain CAPS themes.

On  a  more  optimistic  note,  one  of  the  teachers  indicated during the interview that she shared her new knowledge on De Bono's  thinking  hats  (a  CL  activity  used  during  the  SLP)  with colleagues who did not participate in the SLP. She indicated that they were very excited to use this CL strategy in their classrooms. This teacher clearly operates as a keystone species in this informal CoP - an aspect that should receive more attention in teacher professional development.

## Discussion on the versatility of Cultural-Historical Activity Theory as a lens and the importance of the 'rules', 'division of labour' and 'tools' nodes

The intervention in Limpopo province highlighted the 'contradiction of control'. During the SLP, teachers were introduced to PBL and CL approaches that could enhance SDL (and the contextualisation of science through the infusion of IK into curriculum themes). However, during the post-intervention classroom  visits,  and  in  their  portfolios  (that  included  lesson plans), most of the teachers reverted back to transmission-mode teaching. We referred earlier to the fact that teachers sometimes discard the 'academy' for what is perceived as the 'real world of teaching'.  In  such  a  situation,  CHAT  can  provide  interesting insights and can help to identify possible causes. Firstly, teachers interviewed  indicated  that  the  'pace-setters'  (programmes  of curriculum  implementation)  place  them  under  time  pressure. Consequently, they tended to revert to familiar 'chalk-and-talk' approaches, which are seen by them as being more effective in achieving the intended outcomes. There is, therefore, a tension between 'rules' and the realisation of the 'object' in the activity system. However, such a simplistic stance, which implies that it is only a systemic problem, is a skewed perspective. If one looks at the 'tools' in Figure 3.2, it becomes clear that the SLP did not provide the teachers with the opportunity to compare an inquirybased  or  CL  lesson  with  a  traditional  chalk-and-talk  lesson.

If this was done, teachers might have realised that effective PBL or CL lessons do not necessarily require more time than traditional teacher-centred lessons. This is, therefore, a design flaw in the SLP itself, which should be addressed in future SLPs.

There is a second tension between the 'rules' node and the 'object'. Although infusion of the nature of IK (which could be seen  as  a  'rule'  to  guide  teaching  and  learning)  was  evident during  the  Limpopo  intervention,  it  was  not  context-sensitive. Mostly, Khoi-san examples were used, with hardly any reference to Bapedi, Batswana and Vhavenda IK - the predominant cultures in Limpopo. Once again, this was a design flaw in the SLP. The SLP did not effectively prepare teachers for the reality that they would face in their classrooms in terms of student diversity.

Another tension that  arose  in  the  Limpopo  activity  system, which  sheds  light  on  the  'contradiction  of  control',  is  located within the 'division of labour' node. Many Limpopo teachers did not  provide  evidence  of  critical  reflective  practice  in  their portfolios. Such a lack of critical reflection can enforce the status quo  (transmission-mode  teaching)  and  lead  to  the  'wash-out effect' (Ziechner &amp; Tabachnick 1981) mentioned earlier. Again, it can be asked whether or not the SLP provided sufficient support to the teachers to enable them to develop their skills as reflective practitioners. Whereas researchers could easily subscribe to the lack of transfer in the classroom to systemic (external) factors such  as  rigid  'pace-setters',  CHAT  provided  a  more  nuanced perspective and alerted researchers to possible internal factors, such as design flaws within the SLP itself.

The data collected in the Northern Cape are promising in so far as there was better alignment between the 'objects' in the activity systems. Several teachers in the Northern Cape engaged learners in project-based learning and in CAR. However, the 'contradiction of control' was not entirely eradicated. In order to better understand this, we looked more closely at the 'rules' and 'division of labour' components  of  the  activity  systems.  The  data  show  that  the systemic focus on learner achievement in summative examinations

and  rigid  pace-setters  provided  by  the  Department  of  Basic Education  ('rules')  often  discourage  teachers  from  consistently following inquiry approaches. Again, as in the case of the Limpopo intervention, this suggests a design flaw in the SLP, which did not provide  teachers  with  hands-on  experience  of  discrediting  this misconception regarding the 'tools'. Teachers also indicated that they did not have sufficient time to be more critically reflective as educators ('division of labour') and could not invest sufficient time in their own professional development. Despite the fact that the SLP designers aimed to establish effective communities of practice to support teachers (among others, in their reflection), this did not materialise well in both cycles. The major reason was that many of the  teachers  did  not  have  sufficient  access  to  the  Internet (This aspect will be discussed in Ch. 9).

We need to highlight another important difference between the  two  activity  systems.  In  the  Northern  Cape,  where  a  large percentage of the population is of Khoi-san descent, people live in harmony with the environment and have good knowledge of ethnobotany. This aspect was capitalised on in the SLP and in the classroom and resulted in better-contextualised science teaching and learning. The same contextualisation did not take place in the Limpopo province.

## Conclusion

As a research lens, CHAT can provide the researcher with deeper insights into the data, and into the complexity of the 'object' in an activity  system,  which  can  be  achieved  by  looking  at  'rules', 'division  of  labour'  and  'tools'  more  closely.  In  this  way,  both external and internal factors that impact the 'object' of the activity system are exposed. In addition, CHAT as a lens has predictive value. If this SLP were to be offered in KwaZulu-Natal, the insights obtained  from  the  Limpopo  and  Northern  Cape  interventions could assist the facilitators in circumventing these pitfalls.

In  summary,  CHAT  can  be  a  useful  lens  for  researchers  in different contexts (including other countries) to compare their

work, showing how multiple perspectives can benefit educational transformation globally. What we have illustrated in this research in  two  provinces  in  South  Africa  can  be  applied  in  various international contexts.

The  authors  use  CHAT  as  a  research  lens  in  several  other chapters in this book to analyse their data. The purpose of this chapter  was  to  provide  the  reader  with  a  more  nuanced understanding of the affordances of CHAT as a research lens.

## Summary

This  chapter  highlights  the  use  of  third-generation  CHAT  as  a research lens in education to study the affordances of IK in an attempt to contextualise the school science curriculum. CulturalHistorical Activity Theory is a flexible meta-theoretical framework that can assist the researcher in interpreting data from complex settings or activity systems, and to distil the finer nuances from the data. In this chapter, the authors reflect on a funded research project on the professional development of science teachers to illustrate the utility value of CHAT. This DBR focuses on teachers' participation  in  a  SLP  on  IK  and  the  transfer  of  the  resultant knowledge  to  the  school  classroom.  Teachers'  experiences  of such  epistemological  border-crossing  (infusing  IK  into  science curriculum themes) are explored. The SLP builds on the central wisdom of a Vygotskyan principle, namely, that learning leads to development. During the SLP, the teachers set personal development (learning) goals for themselves. The SLP was  designed  to  enhance  SDL.  This  chapter  compares  the findings from two SLPs. The first SLP took place in the Limpopo province (Cycle 1 of the DBR), and the second in the Northern Cape province (Cycle 2 of the DBR). The latter proved far more successful, and CHAT is used as a lens to shed light on contextual factors  that  may  have  contributed  to  the  different  outcomes. Much has been written about the 'object' in activity systems, but less  has  been  written  about  the  other  components  of  thirdgeneration CHAT. This chapter contributes to CHAT literature by

focussing on the 'rules', 'tools' and 'division of labour' as nodes in the activity system, and how they impact on the activity system's 'object'. A particular contribution of this chapter is an overview of the predictive value of CHAT as a research lens, specifically when  researching  the  role  of  IK  in  better  contextualising  a predominantly Western school curriculum.

## Introduction: Our take on the decolonisation of the curriculum debate

Since  the  student  protests  of  2015,  which  almost  paralysed tertiary  institutions  in  South  Africa,  there  has  been  a  robust debate on the decolonisation of the curriculum. Arguments are characterised by two predominant frameworks, namely, Humanitarian  arguments  that  forefront  inclusivity  or  political arguments against what Mbembe (2016:32) calls a Eurocentric epistemological  canon  (refer  to  Le  Grange's  insights  in  Ch.  1). However,  for  over  two  decades,  the  dominance  of  Western epistemologies in African education has been criticised, and the student protests merely brought it to the attention of a wider audience  (Seehawer  2018).  The  Kenyan  scholar  Wa  Thiong'o (1986) is probably best known for his notion of the 'colonisation of the mind' - the eventual outcome of a school curriculum that marginalises African knowledge in a quest to canonise Western epistemologies.

In a young democracy, such as in South Africa, it is important that  attention  is  given  to  the  insights  of  scholars  such  as  Wa Thiong'o and others. No one would argue against the need for redress  in  education  in  South  Africa.  We  are  probably  lagging behind countries such as Canada, where the Education Renewal Initiative  is  a  classic  example  of  how  the  Canadian  government worked  with  First  Nations  peoples  to  improve  the  quality  of education in Canada (Battiste 2002). However, South Africa needs to be globally competitive, and we argue that 'Western science' concepts will always be at the core of curriculum content. Later in this  introduction,  we  introduce  the  concept  of  'glocalisation' (Patel &amp; Lynch  2013), and  we  explore the affordances of epistemological border-crossing between Western science and IK.

Scholars such as Breidlid and Botha (2015:319-320) view IK as 'a counterhegemonic cultural force to that of colonialism'. These authors (Breidlid &amp; Botha 2015:319-320) are of the opinion that IK is 'well-suited to exposing the Eurocentric assumptions inherent in

conventional ideas about knowledge-making, and formal education, in particular'. Battiste (2002) agrees, stating that:

Eurocentric thought asserts that only Europeans can progress and that  indigenous  peoples  are  frozen  in  time,  guided  by  knowledge systems that reinforce the past and do not look towards the future. As a concept, indigenous knowledge benchmarks the limitations of Eurocentric  theory  -  its  methodology,  evidence  and  conclusions  and reconceptualizes the resilience and self-reliance of indigenous knowledge. Knowledge is not a commodity that can be possessed or controlled by educational institutions, but it is a living process to be absorbed and understood. (pp. 4-5)

Much of the decolonisation of the curriculum debate focuses on 'a constructive  integration  of  both  indigenous  and  Western knowledges in education' (Seehawer 2018:94). In this chapter, we also  advocate  for  an  integration  of  indigenous  and  Western knowledges  and  adoption  of  African  perspectives  in  teaching and  learning.  However,  we  do  it  from  a  learning  psychology perspective (as opposed to the political slant introduced above), and we base our arguments on recent advances in neuroscience. In  Chapter  4,  the  inclusion  of  IK  is  argued  from  an  embodied,  situated and  distributed  cognition  perspective  (Hardy-Vallée  &amp;  Payette 2008), and we will not belabour these aspects here. Our central argument in this chapter, which we will illustrate with research data, is that the holders of IK often are (by definition) self-directed learners.  Battiste  (2002:5)  claims  that  'indigenous  pedagogy values  a  person's  ability  to  learn  independently  by  observing, listening and participating with minimum intervention or instruction'. The  IK  holder's  learning  is  directed  by  finding innovative solutions to authentic problems. This, we argue, holds lessons  for  formal  school  education.  The  ultimate  goal  of  any educational  system  should  be  to  train  self-directed  lifelong learners.  Therefore,  teaching  students  to  appreciate  and  guide their own learning is of critical importance (Dubinsky et al. 2013).

Neuroscience research highlights the plasticity of the brain, and that experiences change  the  nervous  system  (owing  to the strengthening of neuron synapses that accompany  problemsolving). Unfortunately, as we show later in this chapter, many science

classrooms today are characterised by teacher-centred 'chalk-andtalk' approaches, and 'teaching-to-the-test' (Ramnarain 2014), which do not challenge the learners and might not strengthen such neuron synapses.  By  identifying  best  practices,  for  example,  authentic problem-solving in IK contexts, and applying them to formal science education, we might see an improvement in this sector.

Patel  and  Lynch  (2013:223)  speak  of  'glocalisation'  as  'the merger of global and local perspectives on the socio-economic and  political  impact  of  all  phenomena  that  affects  local  and global communities'. These authors unpack glocalisation in terms of education, and they describe glocalised teaching and learning as 'curriculum considerations and pedagogical framing of local and  global  community  connectedness  in  relation  to  social responsibility, justice and sustainability' (Patel &amp; Lynch 2013:223). The border-crossing we advocate in this chapter could package the universal truths that characterise Western science within a context  of  local  relevance.  In  a  world  that  is  characterised  by changing demographics, and increased student diversity in the classroom, South Africa can offer valuable perspectives on how IK could promote glocalised education.

## What is self-directed learning?

Although  the  concept  of  SDL  can  be  found  in  the  work  of Aristotle, Plato and Socrates (Carson 2012), the term emanates from andragogy or adult education theory. The classic definition of SDL given by Knowles (1975) reads as follows:

[ P ]rocess  in  which  individuals  take  the  initiative,  with  or  without the  help  of  others,  in  diagnosing  their  learning  needs,  formulating learning goals, identifying human and material resources, choosing and  implementing  appropriate  learning  strategies  and  evaluating learning outcomes. (p. 18)

Long  (2000)  distinguishes  between  four  conceptualisations of SDL:

- 1. the sociological concept
- 2.  the technique concept

- 3.  the methodological concept
- 4.  the psychological concept.

The  sociological  concept  focuses  on  the  individual  learner within an adult education context. The technique concept focuses on the importance of group learning and social interaction within an adult education context. The methodological concept focuses on distance education processes and the opportunities they hold for SDL. According to Long (2000:16), 'successful self-direction in learning  among  the  first  three  conceptualisations  is  not probable,  and  likely  not  possible,  without  the  psychological processes that foster self-direction in cognition'. In this regard, Long  (2000)  identifies  three  primary  dimensions  (motivation, metacognition and self-regulation) and four secondary dimensions  (choice,  competence,  control  and  confidence)  as important  psychological  concepts  needed  to  understand  and foster SDL. Long's (2000) conceptualisations are also found in more recent definitions of SDL. Garrison (1997) defines:

SDL  as  an  approach  where  learners  are motivated to  assume personal responsibility and collaborative control of the cognitive and contextual processes in constructing and confirming meaningful and worthwhile learning outcomes. (p. 18)

Self-directed learning is, however, not exclusive to adult education (Candy  1991).  Even  small  children  exhibit  characteristics  of  selfdirected learners in the way in which they explore the world around them. Furthermore, Williamson (2007) and Leach (2000) are of the opinion that self-direction forms the basis of both formal and informal learning. This opinion is extremely important within the context of this chapter, where the informal learning of IK holders is investigated.

The effectiveness of learning depends on an individual's intrinsic motivation to learn (Long 2000), whereas flexible thinking also plays an important role (Gencel &amp; Saracaloğlu 2018). Self-directed learners  take  responsibility  and  control  of  their  own  learning because of their internal drive to learn more. In the case of the holders of IK, the drive is often based on a fight for survival. Thus, self-directed learners take deliberate actions, using metacognitive processes, to direct their own learning (Breed 2013).

The SDL process starts with a need to know or a problem to be solved, from where specific learning goals are formulated - the stronger the desire to satisfy the need, the higher the motivation to self-direct learning. The SDL process further specifies that the learners identify available resources for learning, select their own strategies to reach the goal and evaluate if the learning need has been satisfied after completing the process (Knowles 1975). If not, the  process  starts  all  over  again  with  new  or  adjusted  goals, resources and/or strategies. The choice to select resources and strategies, and control their own learning, is part of this process.

This self-directed process explained above does not negate the  fact  that  knowledge  is  socially  constructed  (Chang  2018). Thus, researchers in SDL acknowledge the fact that self-directed learners are not necessarily working individually. In fact, the most successful learning environments for the fostering of SDL include some form of collaborative learning (Amandu, Muliira &amp; Fronda 2013).  Self-directed  learning  is,  therefore,  characterised  by  a process  of  constructing  meaning  while  sharing  with  others (Dawson et al. 2012).

Although  most  researchers  working  in  the  field  of  SDL acknowledge that SDL can be seen as a process, there are others who also view SDL as a personal characteristic applied within a specific context. We concur with Hiemstra and Brockett (2012) that process, context and personal qualities are important aspects of SDL and that they are interconnected.

Self-directed learning can best be fostered in a formal learning context through active learning strategies such as PBL and CL (context) provided that a real-life, challenging problem is posed (Van Zyl &amp; Mentz 2015). A highly self-directed learner is capable of performing the process explained by Knowles effectively and will display characteristics such as a love for learning, curiosity, critical thinking, self-efficacy and an intrinsic motivation to learn more, to name a few SDL characteristics (Guglielmino 2013). Selfdirected  learners  have  the  freedom  to  make  choices  and  to decide how to direct their own learning.

For the purpose of the discussion in this chapter, we will use Knowles's (1975) definition and Long's (2000) conceptualisation of SDL.

## What is indigenous knowledge, and why is it important in a self-directed learning context?

Indigenous knowledge is described by Battiste (2002) as:

[ A ] complex  set  of  technologies  developed  and  sustained  by indigenous  civilizations.  Often  oral  and  symbolic,  it  is  transmitted through  the  structure  of  indigenous  languages  and  is  passed  on to  the  next  generation  through modelling, practice and animation, rather than through the written word. (p. 2)

Rankoana (2017:63) describes 'indigenous knowledge as a systematic body of knowledge acquired by local people through the accumulation of experience, informal experiment, and understanding of their environment'. Jones and Hunter (2003, cited in De Beer 2015:5) and Michie (2000, cited in De Beer 2015:5) listed a number of characteristics of IK, which are relevant in this context:

- · IK is based on experience
- · often tested over centuries of use
- · developed as a collective database of observable knowledge
- · adapted to local culture and environment
- · dynamic and changing: a living knowledge base
- · application to problem-solving
- · oral transmission, sometimes encapsulated in metaphor
- · not  possible  to  separate  IK  from  ethics,  spirituality,  metaphysics, ceremony and social order
- · bridging the science of theory with the science of practice
- · a holistic (IK) versus a reductionist (Western science) approach
- · an ecologically-based approach
- · contextualised versus decontextualised science.

In these IK (informal) learning environments, a context is created that promotes SDL, as we will show later in this chapter.

## Methods

This chapter attempts to answer two research questions:

- · What research data support the hypothesis that the holders of IK are self-directed learners?
- · How can formal science education benefit from insights into learning in informal, IK contexts?

One of the authors (De Beer) coined the construct EKI together with Van Wyk (De Beer &amp; Van Wyk 2011) as part of these authors' Matrix Method for ethnobotanical research. In this chapter, the authors (De Beer &amp; Mentz) look at the EKI values of Khoi-san and Venda people through a different lens, namely, that of SDL, in an attempt to distil insights that could benefit science education in South  Africa.  Cultural-Historical  Activity  Theory  (Engeström 2009) is used to compare informal learning (in IK contexts) and formal science education.

In this chapter, reference is made to individuals who are holders of IK. Their names are disclosed with their written consent, as they take pride in their IK. The focus in this chapter is on their learning and  not  on  their  plant  knowledge  per  se.  An  account  of  their ethnobotanical knowledge has been published by De Beer and Van  Wyk  (2011).  The  said  publication  serves  to  protect  the intellectual  property  rights  of  these  knowledge  holders  and  to prevent  any  pharmaceutical  company  from  potentially  claiming the rights to this knowledge in the future. Ethical clearance for the EKI  work  was  obtained  from  the  University  of  Johannesburg. Ethical clearance for the IK research in a science education context was obtained from NWU. Furthermore, the researchers subscribe to the Code of Ethics of the International Society of Ethnobiology.

## The holders of indigenous knowledge as self-directed learners

De Beer and Mentz (2016, 2017) claim that the holders of IK are often self-directed learners. In the sections that follow, we provide justification for this claim, by analysing data using the insights of

authors  such  as  Knowles  (1975),  Guglielmino  (1978)  and  Long (2000)  on  SDL.  We  start  with  data  on  learning  about  useful plants in cultural settings and then continue with a focus on SDL within an ethno-veterinary context.

## Self-directed learning and authentic problem-solving: Ethnobotanical Knowledge Index

Brookfield (1993) is of the opinion that SDL often has political roots, as issues of power and control are often catalysts for SDL. Often,  the  holders  of  IK  live  in  impoverished  socio-economic conditions, and their SDL is focussed on developing skills that will ensure a better quality of life (Andruske 2000). One example of such SDL, propelled by the drive to ensure a better life, is the case of women in British Columbia who, through SDL, equipped themselves for formal employment in order to free themselves from their dependency on welfare (Andruske 2000). This is also true of many of the descendants of the Khoi-san in the Northern Cape  (De  Beer  2012).  The  Khoi-san  participants  who  were involved  in  the  ethnobotanical  study  of  De  Beer  (2012)  were predominantly farm labourers, and many of them were illiterate. Because of a lack of material resources and the physical isolation of the farms, many of these farmworkers are holders of a rich IK on useful plants (both edible and medicinal). As these farmworkers do not have easy access to Western medicines, they use traditional medicines from nature. Their extensive knowledge of edible and medicinal plants improves the quality of their lives, as they have free access to natural resources from their environment.

The fact that most of the participants were illiterate proves that the  knowledge  was  not  acquired  from  books  but  was  orally transmitted across generations. However, this is a living knowledge base,  and  the  holders  of  IK  have  to  continuously  solve  new problems. One such example was finding a treatment for the HIV and AIDS pandemic. Very soon - through experimentation and careful  observations  -  holders  of  IK  (e.g.  traditional  healers)

discovered that the 'Cancer Bush' or 'Kalkoenbos' ( Sutherlandia frutescens ) (Figure  4.1)  was  effective  in  building  a  patient's immune  system  (Van  Wyk,  Van  Oudtshoorn  &amp;  Gericke  2009). Similar to the processes followed by Western scientists, the holders of  IK  make  careful  observations,  formulate  hypotheses,  choose suitable experimental designs and test plant medicines in vivo .

De Beer and Van Wyk (2011:743) developed an EKI. This index provides a unique insight into SDL in informal settings. The EKI is a tool that forms part of these authors' Matrix Method, a rigorous practical method that allows rapid quantification of the ethnobotanical  knowledge  of  participants.  The  participants  in this study - all descendants of the Khoi-san people of different ages  -  were  shown  a  collection  of  64  herbarium  voucher specimens  of  predominant  plants  in  the  Agter-Hantam  area.

During personal interviews with each participant, their knowledge was recorded. A simple questionnaire with three questions was used (De Beer &amp; Van Wyk 2011):

- 1. Does the person know or recognise the plant?
- 2.  Does the person have a name for the plant?
- 3.  Can  the  person  name  any  uses  of  the  plant  (e.g.  as  food, medicinal use or for arts and crafts)? (p. 743)

For the answer to each question, a numerical value was allocated (1, 2 or 3). The last digit (Table 4.1) represents the sum of the three values (the maximum value being 6) (De Beer &amp; Van Wyk 2011:743). The EKI expresses the participant's knowledge about useful plants. The EKI is obtained by multiplying the total number of plants (64) with the score obtained by the participant for each species (with a maximum score of 6), divided by 384 (obtained by multiplying 64 plants with the maximum score of 6 per species) in the case of the Agter-Hantam data. This is followed by EKI findings from two other  regions,  namely,  Namaqua/Kamiesberg  (Nortjé  2011)  and Vhavenda (Magwede, pers. comm., 2018), to ascertain if the latter findings support those from the Agter-Hantam.

## The Ethnobotanical Knowledge Index of participants in the Agter-Hantam

Table 4.1 provides a simplified excerpt from the Matrix of De Beer and Van Wyk (2011:750), indicating the EKI of selected participants in their study.

There  is  an  interesting  pattern  in  the  EKI's  of  the  different participants. Gert and Andreas, two young boys, had the lowest EKI (both a value of 0.27). The older boys, Bertus and Frans, had slightly higher EKI values (0.37 and 0.38, respectively). The adults, Christien and Jan, had high EKI values of 0.82 and 0.93, respectively.

Closer inspection of these values indicates that the young boys, Gert and Andreas, were relatively knowledgeable about the edible plants, such as the Snotwortel ( Grielum humifusum ),  Jakkalskos ( Hydnora  africana ), the Bokhorinkie ( Microloma  sagittatum ),

Note: Only 10 of the 64 plants are included by way of example.

- a Frans was interviewed in a subsequent survey.

Karoena ( Quaqua incarnata ) and the Veldaalwyn ( Aloe microstigma ). The Veldaalwyn ( Aloe microstigma ) leaves are dried and eaten as an energy booster, but it also has a medicinal value (as a medicine to treat stomach ailments and to relieve back pain). Given  the  fact  that  these  boys  live  in  poor  socio-economic circumstances, it becomes clear that a workable knowledge of the edible  plants  of  the  region  probably  provides  a  welcome  relief from hunger. Their knowledge of plants is needs-driven. As they were of relatively good health, they do not need to know much about medicinal plants - both boys were ignorant about medicinal

plants  in  the  area,  such  as  Wilde-als  ( Artemisia  afra ),  Ballerja ( Mentha  longifolia ), Kattekruid ( Ballota africana ), Kriekiebos ( Melianthus comosus ) and Karmedik ( Dicoma capensis ).

The older boys, Bertus and Frans, also had knowledge of two of the  common  medicinal  plants  used  in  the  Agter-Hantam  area, namely,  Wilde-als  and  Ballerja. Artemisia  afra (Wilde-als)  and Mentha longifolia (Ballerja)  are  important medicines for common cold and flu (influenza), conditions not restricted to any particular age group. Therefore, it  makes  sense  for  these  boys  -  who  themselves could experience common cold and flu, to know about these veld medicines. However, they were ignorant about the uses of other medicinal plants, such as Kattekruid, Kriekiebos and Karmedik, as these plants are used to treat conditions that occur in older people.

Ballota africana (Kattekruid) is used by women after childbirth and to stimulate milk production in lactating women (De Beer 2012). Melianthus comosus (Kriekiebos) is used to treat rheumatic joints and backache - conditions that are a result of hard physical labour required of farmworkers. Dicoma capensis (Karmedik) is also used to treat high blood pressure, back pains and cancer (De Beer 2012). It makes sense, therefore, that children do not have knowledge of these plants, as they are not of much relevance to their daily needs. For older people, these medicinal plants can bring relief from ailments common to their age group and thereby improve their quality of life.

These EKI values, and other data from the interviews, show that  SDL  takes  place.  It  starts  with  a need that  is  identified. Children need to identify edible plants, learn where to find these plants  and  how  to  harvest  them  sustainably.  As  children  grow older and contract common cold and flu, there is a need to know about certain medicinal plants. For ageing adults, there is a need to treat conditions such as rheumatism, and this explains their wider  knowledge  of  medicinal  plants  and  higher  EKI  values. Plants are chosen  after consulting the elders, as well as experimenting  with  existing  plants  in  their  environment.  They were most probably witness to how specific plant material was

prepared for medicinal use. Their learning was not dependent on memorisation of facts that have no meaning. The former context is when metacognitive processes play an important role.

It  is  also  worth  noting  that  such  learning  occurs  in  a  social structure.  Both  PBL  and  CL  -  approaches  that  can  potentially enhance  SDL  -  are  used.  A  knowledgeable  elder,  such  as  Jan Baadjies, can assist in scaffolding learning about useful plants for members of the community. Learning entails more than simply identifying the plant species. The learner also needs to understand the physiological needs of the plant, as this will determine the habitat in which it will grow. This is crucial to the speedy location of  plants.  Also,  harvesting  is  to  be  done  sustainably.  Through experimentation,  best  practices  are  identified,  for  example, whether the leaves or roots are most efficacious, which promotes sustainable harvesting practices.

If one now looks at this informal learning through the lens of Knowles's (1975) definition of SDL, it becomes clear that holders of IK are often self-directed learners. The community members have identified a need, that is, because they live in poor socioeconomic conditions, they need to have sufficient knowledge of edible and medicinal plants in their environment to improve the quality of their lives. Thus, they have identified their own learning needs.  For  young  children,  they  predominantly  need  to  learn about edible plants. For older people, the learning need would mean a good knowledge of medicinal plants:

- · Learners  identify  resources  for  learning  to  address  their learning goals. As IK is an oral tradition, these resources might be knowledgeable community members or own experiences and observations.
- · Appropriate learning strategies are adopted. These could include field trips with knowledgeable mentors, experimentation (including  the  formulation  of  hypotheses,  careful  observation, data  collection  and  drawing  conclusions)  and  CL  strategies through  discussions  with  others  who  share  the  same  needs. Experimentation  could  include  different  preparation  methods and  dosages  (mixtures,  ointments,  snuffs,  enemas,  etc.)  and

- reflection  on  previous  experiences,  which  form  part  of  the metacognitive processes involved.
- · Outcomes are evaluated by determining whether the learning need  was  addressed.  Could  edible  or  medicinal  plants  be harvested to fulfil a specific need? Metacognition and reflection also form an important part of this step of the process.

## Ethnobotanical Knowledge Index values in the Kamiesberg, Namaqualand

Nortjé (2011) conducted a similar study in the Kamiesberg region to that of De Beer (2012). She also used the Matrix Method and interviewed people on the use of 85 plant species. However, a big difference  was  that  she  focussed  exclusively  on  the  use  of medicinal plants and not edible plants. However, several of the 85 medicinal plants identified in her study are also edible; the authors  of  this  chapter  focussed  on  children's  recognition  of edible and non-edible medicinal plants. Her data show a similar pattern  to  that  of  De  Beer  (2012)  for  the  Agter-Hantam  area (Table 4.2).

Firstly, a similar pattern is displayed in both the Kamiesberg and  the  Agter-Hantam,  with  children  having  lower  EKI  values than adults. Nortjé (p. 128) explains the lower EKI's of children in the Kamiesberg (0.17 as compared to 0.26 in the Agter-Hantam) in terms of the fact that her survey focussed only on the medicinal plants and not on edible plants. A secondary analysis of her data shows that children performed significantly better in recognising

and identifying those (medicinal) plants that are also edible, such as Carpobrotus edulis (Suurvy or Ghaukum), Conicosia elongata (Varkiesknol), Hoodia gordonii (the  'Ghaap')  and Aloe microstigma (Veldaalwyn), which is eaten as an energy booster, and Viscum capense (Lidjiestee),  which  is  commonly  used  as  a  health  tea. Children commonly eat C. edulis as a snack - they suck the sweetsour pulp from the ripe fruit (Van Wyk &amp; Gericke 2018).

Had Nortjé asked children to provide uses other than medicinal, the EKI values of the Kamiesberg would probably have matched those of the Agter-Hantam. For example, all the children in her survey could recognise C. edulis , and they could also name the plant. This provided a score of 3 out of the possible 6. During the interviews, she asked children if they knew of any medicinal uses of Carpobrotus , which they did not. However, if she asked them to name any uses (including that of being a food source), the EKI values would probably have been higher.

Again, the data show that young children's primary interest is learning about edible plants, as this relates to an authentic problem they face (insufficient food) and, thus, an identified learning goal. Only later in life, do they show interest in medicinal plants.

## Ethnobotanical Knowledge Index values in Vhavenda

Magwede  and  Van  Wyk  (2018)  conducted  an  ethnobotanical inventory of useful plants of the Vhavenda people in the Vhembe district of the Limpopo province. The Matrix Method was used, and participants were shown a flip-file with 327 plant species. Magwede and Van Wyk included food plants as a category, as well  as  medicinal  plant  use.  Senior  citizens  had  the  highest average EKI value (0.6), followed by adults (0.52) and children with the lowest (0.33). Again, children could, in most cases, only identify edible plants and  were  not  knowledgeable  about medicinal plants (Magwede, pers. comm., 2018). Various species of Amaranthus were well known to all the children, as this genus includes  popular  vegetables  (such  as  Vowa,  Vowakholomo,

Marog or Misbredie) (Magwede et al. 2018). Children were also very  knowledgeable  about  edible  fruits,  such  as Hoslundia opposite (Tshivhuvhudzi  or  Butter  Berry)  and Vitex  ferruginea (Mupfuluphumbu).  As  would  be  expected,  children  mentioned the use of V. ferruginea as a food source, but did not comment on its medicinal use for sore throats.

Our data indicate a needs-driven learning trend, characterised by authentic problem-solving. From these indigenous (informal) learning settings, we conclude this chapter by focussing on the lessons these hold for formal education in South Africa. Before we conclude, we use a second example to show that the holders of IK are self-directed learners.

## Subsistence livestock farmers in the Vhembe district in Limpopo and in the Eastern Cape province as self-directed learners: Combating ticks

In both the Vhembe district in Limpopo and in the Eastern Cape province, there are many subsistence livestock farmers that live and  work  in  marginalised  communities,  characterised  by  poor socio-economic  conditions.  These  farmers  are  dependent  on healthy  livestock  to  survive,  but  they  often  do  not  have  the financial  resources  to  buy  expensive  veterinary  medicines.  In order to solve this problem, they demonstrate SDL, as is described in the following sections.

## Diagnosing own learning needs: The need to find sustainable solutions to the problem of ticks

Ticks  negatively  affect  the  health  of  animals  and  can  lower production, which is detrimental to the subsistence farmer. Ticks transmit  a  wide  range  of  pathogens  that  include  protozoa, bacteria and viruses. Examples of such diseases are tick-borne relapsing fever, Babesiosis and African tick-bite fever (Chitanga,

Gaff  &amp;  Mukaratirwa  2014).  Subsistence  farmers  cannot  always afford  expensive commercial veterinary medicines. In addition, many farmers realise that some of these medicines are no longer very effective as pathogens develop resistance to antibiotic over time (Magwede et al. 2014).

On  the  other  hand,  ethno-veterinary  plants  inhibit  bacteria using mechanisms that differ from those of commercial antibiotics (Magwede et al. 2014). Subsistence farmers and holders of IK, as self-directed learners, have identified a learning need, namely, to solve this real-life problem and to find cost-effective treatments to control ticks in cattle herds.

## dentifying human and material I resources for learning

As in most IK contexts, learners have to identify knowledgeable others in the community. As IK predominantly relies on an oral tradition, there is often a shortage  of  printed  resources. Knowledge of effective tick control is mostly self-taught through time spent in the veld, as well as through apprenticeships with experts - local holders of IK. Knowledge is also shared during clan gatherings (Constant &amp; Tshisikhawe 2018). Plants such as Lantana camara Synadenium cupulare , and Cissus quadrangularis are used to control ticks, as well as old engine oil and Jeyes fluid (Magwede et al. 2014; Moyo et al. 2009). It is rather problematic that most rural farmers start to consider ticks as problematic only when cattle develop wounds caused by a heavy infestation of ticks (Magwede et al. 2014). It is only at this stage that the farmer  starts  experimenting  with  plants  to  heal  the  wounds. Topical  application  of  plant  materials  as  a  paste  or  sap  is  a common  practice. Decoctions are also made. These are administered orally when cattle are in the kraal (Magwede et al. 2014). The holders of IK are aware that these plant medicines should  be  harvested  sustainably  using  the  leaves  and  stems of Synadenium cupulare (Dead-man's tree) to make an ointment for wounds, rather than harvesting the roots (Magwede et al. 2014).

## Choosing and implementing appropriate learning strategies

Cooperative learning is prominent in IK settings (Jautse, Thambe &amp; De Beer 2016). Also, Vhembe boys learn from the more knowledgeable others  in  community,  going  out  with  elders  to collect ethno-veterinary plants (Magwede et al. 2014). Rankoana (2017) indicates that informal experimentation is also common. Through experimentation and observation, subsistence farmers have noticed that some of the plants used to combat ticks have a  stronger  effect  when  mixed  with  conventional  acaricides (commercial tick-repellents). For instance, in the Vhembe district, the  bark  of Philenoptera  violacea (Apple-leaf)  has  a  stronger effect when mixed in a decoction with an acaricide (Magwede et al. 2014). Through experimentation and careful observations, IK  holders  have  discovered the synergistic effect of the mixed medications.

Most of the tick-repellent  plant  extracts  were  discovered  in the process of treating tick-infected cattle wounds. Indigenous knowledge  holders  would  have  observed  a  reduction  in  tick numbers after the topical application or oral administration of certain plant extracts (Magwede et al. 2014:163). This would have led to further experimentation.

## Evaluating learning outcomes

Each intervention is followed by some assessment. Was this an effective measure to combat ticks? Different subsistence farmers would share their experiences in using specific ethno-veterinary plants. Reflections would consider the collection of plant material (whether roots, stems or leaves are used), methods of preparation (infusions,  lotions  or  ointments)  and  methods  of  administration (orally by addition to drinking water or topically by application to the skin or nasal passages). Where a plant extract does not provide the  desired  effect  in  combating  ticks,  it  is  mixed  with  other acaricides, and the synergistic effect thereof is monitored (Magwede et al.  2014).  One  example  is  the  use  of  a  decoction

prepared  from  the  bark  of Philenoptera  violacea (Mufhanda  or Apple-leaf) and a conventional acaricide to strengthen its effect (Magwede et al. 2014). Again, metacognitive and reflective skills play an important role in this process.

In  the  close-knit rural societies where the subsistence farmers live and work, they learn about best practices during clan gatherings (Constant &amp; Tshisikhawe 2018). This indicates thoughtful reflection. As  the  farmers  share  best  practices,  they  come  to  distinguish between effective and non-effective measures.

Western science  is  giving  credibility  to  this  IK.  Laboratory tests have shown that Jeyes fluid and engine oil (an indigenous remedy for ticks) have an efficacy almost equivalent to that of Ektoban  (a  commercial  acaricide).  A  plant  extract  such  as Lantana  camara has  an  efficacy  of  57%  (Moyo  et  al.  2009). Traditional knowledge on combating tick-borne diseases may, therefore, enrich modern pharmacology (Kioko et al. 2015).

## Lessons from indigenous knowledge holders for formal science education

The above examples of the EKI and combating ticks in ethnoveterinary contexts hold important lessons for science education in South Africa. Webb (2017:119) describes the general pattern of teaching and learning in science classrooms in South Africa as 'traditional  teaching  methods  exemplified  by  chorus  teaching, repetition, memorisation  and  recall'.  Such  methods  do  not promote  SDL  and  do  not  adequately  prepare  learners  for  a complex  21st  century.  In  contrast  to  this  scenario,  the  above examples illustrate how holders of IK engaged in PBL, encouraged by a 'driving question' that is rooted in an authentic problem or situation. In this regard, there is synergy between SDL and IK, as both  place  a  high  premium  on  PBL  and  CL  and  on  skills development for sustainable living.

In  Chapter  3,  we  focussed  on  CHAT  as  a  research  lens.  In Figure 3.4 in Chapter 3, we showed the alignment between the

SDL process (activity system on the left) and IK (activity system on the right). The 'subjects' of the two activity systems - SDL and IKS, respectively  -  shared  a  common  'object',  namely,  the development of skills and acquisition of knowledge to succeed in society  (make  a  living).  Among  the  'tools',  there  were  also similarities,  namely,  an  emphasis  on  cooperative  and  PBL.  We, therefore, conclude that, by distilling principles that characterise learning  in  IK  contexts,  we  might  enhance  SDL  in  the  formal classroom.

In  formal science education, we tend to provide answers to questions that students have not asked for themselves. In the IK examples provided earlier, learners  were  motivated  to  address authentic problems. In the formal classroom, curriculum content is  often  disconnected  from  the  everyday  lives  of  the  learners, which can result in disengaged learners.

In the next few paragraphs, we compare two activity systems, namely, a young learner in a rural area, learning informally from holders of IK (activity system A on the left in Figure 4.2), and a learner in a formal school classroom (activity system B on the right in Figure 4.2).

## Learning in a contextualised informal environment

In the activity system on the left, the learner (as 'subject') is faced with an authentic problem: either (as a herd boy) finding solutions to external parasites such as ticks on cattle or learning to identify and locate edible plants in order to not go to bed hungry. There is, therefore, an affective commitment to the identified learning goals.  Resources  are  identified  to  achieve  the  'object'  of  the activity (knowledge for sustainable livelihoods). In this regard, it is  essential  to  focus  on  the  'rules'  characterising  the  activity system. Jautse et al. (2016) have shown that the holders of IK often display a collective responsibility, which is very reminiscent of  Johnson  and  Johnson's  (1989)  criteria  for  positive  social interdependence in CL. Magwede et al. (2014) show that boys and young men in the Vhembe district are the major contributors to the collective knowledge of tick control in cattle. The elderly in the community  are the major contributors of knowledge (Table 4.3), but boys and young men in the 15 - 25 year age group show a remarkably high contribution to knowledge.

Magwede  et  al.  (2014)  explain  this  as:  young  men  in  the 15  -  25-year  age  group  are  the  collectors  of  medicinal  plants. They escort elders during field work, and they assist with digging and collecting plants in places the elders find difficult to access. Important is the fact that these young men display a collective  responsibility.  For  the  subsistence  farmers  in  the Vhembe district, livelihoods depend on healthy cattle, and these young men realise their responsibility, that is, to contribute to the

TABLE 4.3: Percentage contribution of different age groups to collective knowledge of tick control in the Vhembe district.

knowledge  base  to  ensure  that  cattle  herds  are  healthy.  An unspoken 'rule' in the activity system is therefore the collective responsibility for maintaining a living knowledge base.

Another  prominent  'rule'  in  this  activity  system  is  that  of environmental conservation and sustainable harvesting of ethnoveterinary plants. Magwede et al. (2014) interviewed 42 Vhembe holders of IK, and they indicated that one of the reasons why they desist  from  using  commercial  pesticides  to  combat  ticks  is  an uncertainty  about  their  side  effects.  They  are  very  aware  that microbes become resistant to popular antibiotics. They, therefore, continue to experiment with ethno-veterinary solutions to counter the problem of ticks.

'T ools' utilised include PBL and CL. The subsistence farmers have to find solutions when ethno-veterinary medicines do not provide the desired outcomes. For instance, certain farmers realised that a decoction prepared from Philenoptera violacea was not as effective as expected; however, through experimentation they came to realise that it was more effective when mixed with acaricide.

The 'community' consists of, among others, elders who have comprehensive  knowledge.  'Division  of  labour'  refers  to  the different  roles  of  the  learner,  and  here  the  learner  as  a  selfdirected problem-solver should be highlighted.

## Learning in the formal science classroom

The 'object' in the second activity system, the formal school system, is  characterised  by  what  Mbembe  (2016:31)  calls  'the  mania  for assessment'. Firstly, it should be noted that the school curriculum objectives are plausible and emphasise inquiry skills among others. The revised South African school science curriculum advocates for an approach that inspires 'learners to explore objects, situations and events in their immediate environment, to collect data and record information and draw conclusions accurately' (Department of Basic Education 2002:34). However, these goals are often not achieved owing  to  systemic  problems  such  as  packed  curricula  and  time schedules (the 'pace-setters'), which place pressure on teachers to

'complete content merely to comply with the pace setter rather than focus on learners' cognition' (Reddy, De Beer &amp; Petersen 2018). Also, Ramnarain (2014:72) describes the unfortunate and common practice that 'teachers deliberately tailor their instruction according to expected test and examination questions'. According to Ramnarain (2014:72), it is especially teachers at township schools who 'perceive a didactic  approach  to  be  effective'  if  it  prepares 'learners for tests and examinations'.

Instead  of  using  'tools'  such  as  effective  CL  and  PBL  in  the science classroom, many teachers fall back on transmission-mode teaching  (such  as  the  traditional  lecture  method).  Ramnarain (2014:71)  has  shown  that  'with  regard  to  inquiry  facilitation  for conceptual understanding, teachers at township and rural schools believe  their  explanations  of  concepts  to  be  more  effective'. Research conducted by Ramnarain and Schuster (2014:627) has shown  that  teachers  at  township  schools  have  a  strong  'active direct' teaching orientation (Table 4.4 and Figure 4.3), and they would lecture to the learners; and, where practical work is done, these follow a recipe-like approach to confirm what has been dealt with in theory. On the other hand, these researchers have found that many 'teachers at suburban schools exhibit a guided inquiry orientation, with concepts being developed via a guided exploration phase' (Ramnarain &amp; Schuster 2014:627).

The  transmission-mode  approaches  often  do  not  create inviting learning environments. Schulze and Van Heerden (2015) have shown that many South African school learning environments lack  motivational  value.  These  authors  advocate  that  teachers should rethink their teaching methods and lesson activities, as 'the science classroom is the most significant factor in motivating students  to  achieve  academically  in  science'  (Schulze  &amp;  Van Heerden 2015:7). In the formal school context, the 'community' is not very supportive in inspiring the learner to take the role of a 'scientific sleuth' and solve problems.

Unlike learners having to solve authentic problems in informal learning  contexts  and  develop  as  self-directed  learners,  the practices in many schools inhibit both PBL and SDL.

## Contradiction of control

An activity system is built around its 'object' (Engeström, 2009). It  is  useful  to  distinguish  between  the envisaged (anticipated) object and the realised object. In the case of the formal science classroom (the activity system on the right in Figure 4.2), the

envisaged object might be the ambitious CAPS curriculum aims (Department of Basic Education 2002:5).

The  National  Curriculum  Statement  Grades  R-12  aims  to produce learners that are able to:

- · identify and solve problems and make decisions using critical and creative thinking
- · work effectively as individuals and with others as members of a team
- · organise and manage themselves and their activities responsibly and effectively
- · collect, analyse, organise and critically evaluate information
- · communicate effectively using visual, symbolic and/or language skills in various modes
- · use science and technology effectively and critically showing responsibility towards the environment and the health of others
- · demonstrate an understanding of the world as a set of related systems by recognising that problem-solving contexts do not exist in isolation.

The realised object  is  often,  in  many  classrooms,  something completely  different,  and  the  description  by  Ramnarain  and Schuster (2014) is probably apt, that this emphasis:

[ O ]n scoring high marks meant that these teachers, although they believed in the notion of student-centeredness, felt the need to adopt teaching methods whereby students would assimilate the 'products' of science, i.e. the body of acquired knowledge, and thus be better prepared for these examinations. (p. 648)

This  'teach  towards  the  test'  erodes  elevated  aims  such  as fostering critical and creative thinking and problem-solving skills.

McNeil (1999) coined the term 'contradiction of control'. This term sheds light on the complexity of the 'object' in the activity system.  In  this  case,  the  intended  'object'  is  not  necessarily achieved, owing to tensions in the activity system. For instance, the pace-setters could be seen as a 'rule' that negatively impact on 'tools' such as PBL, as many teachers hold the (erroneous) assumption that such inquiry approaches take more time than transmission-mode approaches. Furthermore, the teacher (part of  the  'community')  might  not  have  the  necessary  skills  to

effectively facilitate inquiry (problem-based) approaches in the classroom, thus reverting to 'chalk-and-talk' approaches. Ramnarain  and  Schuster  (2014)  emphasise  that  facilitating scientific investigations in the science classroom:

[ R ]equires a  deep  understanding  of  science  practices  and  investigative skills,  in  order  to  guide  students  in  formulating  research questions and  planning  investigations,  as  well  as  a  deep  understanding  of science concepts. (p. 648)

Because South Africa has many underqualified science teachers (Bernstein  2011),  who  do  not  possess  the  above  competencies, many teachers depend on lecture-mode teaching. The 'division of labour' refers to the different roles of the 'subject' (learner). The teacher-centred, lecture-mode teaching and learning, that often characterises the science classroom, does not provide the learner with the opportunity to take on the role of a problem-solver or a novice  scientist.  Instead,  the  learner  becomes  a  consumer  of knowledge,  regurgitating  learnt  facts  in  the  examination.  This prevents  the  development  of  a  nuanced  understanding  of  the nature and tenets of science (Cronje, De Beer &amp; Ankiewicz 2015). This results in a 'contradiction of control', with a conflict between the envisaged and realised objects of the activity system.

In  the  case  of  the  activity  system  on  the  left-hand  side  of Figure 4.2, namely, learning in a contextualised informal environment,  there  is  no  such  'contradiction  of  control'.  The 'realised  object'  is  the  same  as  the  'envisaged  object',  namely, obtaining IK to ensure a sustainable livelihood.

## Lessons for formal school education

Based on Ausubel's (1963) work on meaningful learning, Cobern et  al.  (2014:2270)  developed the construct shown in Table 4.4 and  Figure  4.3,  indicating  the  pedagogical  foci  of  teachinglearning activities superimposed on Ausubel's axes.

In the case of Vhembe learners engaging in PBL (experimenting with  ethno-veterinary  plants  as  acaricides),  open  discovery learning is clearly taking place (Table 4.4 and Figure 4.3). This is

in  stark  contrast  to  many  formal  science  classrooms  where science is presented as factual knowledge ('ready-made science'), which does not provide learners with a good understanding of the  tenets  of  the  NOS.  Neither  does  it  speak  to  the  affective domain in order to motivate learners. The informal learning taking place in IK contexts is often characterised by creative problemsolving,  and  the  learner  is  motivated  to  solve  an  authentic problem.

All stakeholders in science education could benefit from these insights. A teacher should contextualise the learning content in a way that the learners are confronted with an authentic problem to  be  solved.  In  this  regard,  the  teacher  could  structure  the learning  task  around  the  six  key  features  of  project-based environments as identified by Krajcik and Shin (2016:276):

- · There should be a driving question, a problem to be solved.
- · There  should  be  a  focus  on  key  standards  in  science  (in  a South African context, the CAPS specific aims).
- · Learners should explore the driving question by participating in scientific practices.
- · Learners  should  engage  in  collaborative  activities  to  find solutions.
- · In the process, learners should be scaffolded (e.g. with learning technologies).
- · Learners  should  create  tangible  products  or  artefacts  as representations of learning.

If we examine the learning of Vhembe children according to these features, it becomes clear that they attain the grade. The driving question, 'how can we ensure that our cattle are healthy and tickfree?',  provides  the  stimulus  for  them  to  learn  about  ethnoveterinary plants from elders, to experiment with various combinations of acaricides to determine their synergistic effects, and to make careful observations. This they  do  in  a  CL  environment, and it results in tangible products (ethno-veterinary acaricides) that are made available to other people in the community.

In  conclusion,  the  formal  science  curriculum  in  South  Africa advocates for the inclusion of IK as one of the principles that should

underpin  education  (Department  of  Basic  Education  2011:5). The  curriculum  also  anticipates  the  development  of  creative thinking and problem-solving among learners. Bybee (1993) and Ramnarain and Schuster (2014:629) highlight the 'pivotal role of the  teacher  in  curriculum  implementation'  and  warn  that,  if teachers' practices do not represent these curriculum innovations, the  entire  process  of  curriculum  change  fails.  It  is,  therefore, essential that teacher training should also address these insights from  the  holders  of  IK  -  in  both  pre-  and  in-service  teacher education - in order to bring these curriculum goals to fruition. In Chapter 2, the authors reflected on in-service teacher education programmes offered by NWU that build on these insights. These programmes  guide  teachers  on  how  epistemological  bordercrossing between IK and Western science (the CAPS curriculum) could  create  inviting  and  motivating  learning  environments  for learners. This, we claim, holds affordances for promoting SDL in our  schools  and  to  better  prepare  learners  for  a  complex  21st century.

## Summary

This chapter focuses on the holders of IK as self-directed learners and lessons that can be derived for science education in South Africa. Two cases are presented on how the holders of IK are selfdirected learners. The first case deals with learning about edible and medicinal plants, which is need-driven, and how it meets the criteria for SDL. The authors reflect on examples of South African cultural groups' knowledge of useful plants, as encapsulated in the  EKI.  The  second  case  explores  SDL  in  an  ethno-veterinary context, focussing on SDL to effectively combat ticks in cattle an  important  aspect  in  the  lives  of  subsistence  farmers  in South Africa. The latter part of the chapter focuses on how these insights could be implemented in the STEM school curriculum, in order to promote SDL for a complex 21st century.

## Introduction

It is common  knowledge  that  the  quality  of Science and Mathematics teaching in South Africa needs to be improved (this has been discussed by Mentz and De Beer in Ch. 2). Literature

How to cite: De Beer, J. &amp; Van Wyk, B.-E., 2019, 'Arguing for the inclusion of indigenous knowledge  in  the  STEM  curriculum:  Possibilities  and  challenges',  in  J.  De  Beer  (ed.), The decolonisation of the curriculum project: The affordances of indigenous knowledge for self-directed learning (NWU Self-directed Learning Series Volume 2), pp. 117-142, AOSIS, Cape Town. https://doi.org/10.4102/aosis.2019.BK133.05

has provided  reasons, such  as underqualified teachers and under-resourced classrooms, among  others, for the dismal performance  of  South  African  school  learners  in  international benchmark tests such as Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study. However, a reason for the poor performance that is not  always  considered  is  the  marginalisation  of  the  affective domain of human functioning (e.g. the role of student interest and motivation in the learning process). Such disregard for affective outcomes  often  lead  to  disinterest,  and  students  end  up  not appreciating the role of science and technology in our everyday lives (Buma 2018; De Beer 2015). Learners do not enter the STEM classroom as tabula rasa, and they almost always have localised IK that could contextualise the often abstract ('Western') curriculum content better. This, we argue, could make science education more relevant and meaningful for learners and cultivate their interest in science. Gibbons' (2000) notion of 'Mode 2 knowledge production' (Gibbons 2000:159, 161) could be realised by following more Afrocentric  approaches  that  are  more  sensitive  towards  cultural contexts in the Natural Sciences classroom. With this, we do not argue that the knowledge constructs (principles and laws) that characterise  global  Science  and  Mathematics  curricula  should be  overlooked.  These  principles  and  laws  will  always  be  the backbone  of  the  substantive  nature  of  the  Natural  Sciences. Instead,  we  advocate  for  'glocalisation'  (Patel  &amp;  Lynch  2013)  globally competitive curricula, with local relevance.

De  Beer  (2015)  refers  to  Zaruwa  and  Kwahe  (2014),  for example, who show how an abstract concept, such as endothermic reactions  in  a  chemistry  lesson,  could  be  contextualised  by introducing  traditional  leather  tanning,  in  certain  contexts.  In some cultures,  cattle  bones  were  crushed  to  produce  calcium powder,  to  which  potash  was  added.  Subsequently,  bird  dung was added to the calcium and potash mixture, and the resultant paste  was  smeared  on  the  soaked  skins.  In  Figure  5.1,  science teachers  engage  with  a  holder  of  IK,  who  illustrate  how  skins were traditionally treated. Zaruwa and Kwahe (2014) show that bird  droppings  are  rich  in  uric  acid,  which  lowers  the  pH.  The

lower pH could enhance the denaturation of proteins, and this could act as a catalyst for an endothermic reaction with water molecules. For many rural learners, who might struggle with the abstract concept of endothermic reactions, such contextualisation might provide better access to the learning content.

Another example - infusing IK on medicinal plants into the natural  and  Life  Science  curricula  -  highlights  the  fact  that scholars disagree on how (and if) this border-crossing should be done. Although Western science and IK share a mutual knowledge domain,  there  are  big  differences  in  their  epistemologies  and methodologies  (Onwu  &amp;  Mosimege  2004).  Whereas  authors such as De Beer and Whitlock (2009) argue for an inclusion of IK in  the  science  curriculum  where  the  shared  tenets  of  Western science and IK are emphasised (e.g. both Western and indigenous scientists formulate hypotheses, develop experimental designs,

make observations and draw conclusions), other authors (e.g. Onwu and Mosimege 2004) oppose this. The latter authors are of the opinion that it would be a mistake to subject IK to the same  verification  processes  as  Western  science.  They  hold the outlook that, as these are two different knowledge systems, the verification processes should be different too.

South Africa has both rich biodiversity and cultural diversity. The country has some 30 000 species of flowering plants (Van Wyk &amp; Gericke  2018),  and  the  different  cultural  groups  in  the country use these plants for a variety of reasons, for example, as food and drink, as cosmetics, as medicines and health tonics, and for arts and crafts. In the Life Sciences classroom, a teacher can engage learners in simple laboratory protocols, such as  the  Kirby-Bauer  technique,  where  they  can  determine  the antimicrobial qualities of medicinal plants. A simple way of determining the sensitivity of a microorganism to an antimicrobial substance (e.g. an active ingredient in a medicinal plant)  is  to  use  agar  plates  that  are  inoculated  with  microorganisms and to let the active substances in the plant material diffuse into the  agar  medium (De Beer &amp; Whitlock 2009; Mitchell &amp; Cater 2000).  Growth-inhibition  zones  will  be  seen  if  the  chemical substances  are  effective  as  antimicrobial  agents.  De  Beer  and Whitlock  (2009)  describe  a  simple  technique  suitable  for  the classroom,  where  learners  have  to  draw  upon  the  syntactical NOS in performing the activity. In a similar vein, De Beer and Van Wyk (2011b) describe a simplified rapid appraisal methodology, using the Matrix Method, for doing ethnobotanical surveys in the Life Sciences classroom. The advantage of such border-crossing is that the learners come to a better understanding of the similar nature of Western and indigenous science.

In both pre- and in-service teacher education, teachers should be trained to effectively infuse IK into the classroom - a focus pertinent in Chapter 2 and Chapter 5 to Chapter 8 of this book. However,  according  to  Onwu  and  Mosimege  (2004),  teachers should  also  be  made  aware  of  the  unique  characteristics  that distinguish IK from Western science.

Next, we will explore the affordances of such inclusion of IK in the formal curriculum from an Embodied, Situated and Distributed Cognition (ESDC).

## The affordances of indigenous knowledge in the science classroom: Justification from an embodied, situated and distributed cognition perspective

Research  in  cognition  and  neuroscience  has  resulted  in  ESDC becoming popular as a framework (Hardy-Vallée &amp; Payette 2008) to study and to understand cognition. It postulates that cognitive processes are not limited to symbolic processing in the brain and that  cognition  and  learning  entail  more  than  simply  chemical synaptic  transmission  and  communication  between  neurons  in the brain. A person's regular, normal activities, such as exercise, stress and social interaction, all affect synaptic strength (Dubinsky, Roehrig  &amp;  Varma  2013).  Embodied,  situated  and  distributed cognition  claims  that  'cognition  is  physiologically  embodied, socioculturally situated, and ostensibly distributed among individuals'  (Chahine  2013:434).  Chahine  makes  a  strong  case that  cognitive  processes  involved  in  learning  are  inherently multimodal  and  that  'bodily  movement,  use  of  manipulatives, acts of drawing pictorial displays, verbal language, use of written

symbols play a role in understanding concepts' (Chahine 2013:435).  Chahine  (2013:435)  states  that  'high-level  cognitive processes are fundamentally galvanised by multimodal sensorimotor actions that operate above and beyond the neuronal networks in the brain'. The ESDC framework is underpinned by the notion that cognitive processes are embedded physiologically in  action,  situated  in  the  sociocultural  world  and  distributed among  agents, artefacts and external structures (Chahine 2013:434;  Hardy-Vallée  &amp;  Payette  2008).  It  is  important  to recognise the social context of learning, as well as the sociocultural background of learners. Jegede and Aikenhead (1999) are of the opinion  that,  when  teaching  and  learning  are  informed  by  the learner's  worldview  and  cultural  background,  smooth  bordercrossings can be obtained.

Various chapters in this book focus on the learning of IK, as facilitated  by  a  project  funded  by  the  NRF  and  the  Fuchs Foundation.  This  project  was  built  on  the  understanding  that learners' 'cognition is motivated and embodied by their ability to use multiple modalities and translations within and between such modalities' (Chahine 2013:435). Hill (2000:80) states that ESDC advocates for a different perspective of 'the search for cognition from inside of the skull to an exploration of the relations that hold between  animals  (made  up  of  bodies  and  brains)  and  their surroundings'. In the project (refer to Ch. 5 and Ch. 6 in particular), teachers engaged with holders of IK at museums, and we argue that their physical (bodily) involvement in activities such as beerbrewing,  leather  tanning  or  making  music  (and  learning  about fractions)  using  boomwhackers  (see  Ch.  6),  in  a  sociocultural space  (where  they  collectively  construct  knowledge),  support learning and cognition. In Vygotskyan (1978) terms, the teachers' learning is scaffolded across the ZPD, and learning first takes place on  the  social  plane  (collectively  engaging  in  activities  at  the Museum with colleagues, facilitators and holders of IK, as can be seen in Figure 5.3), and it is then (2nd plane) internalised, where teachers reflect on their learning. Ideally, this knowledge and skills would be transferred to the teachers' classrooms.

In Figure 5.3, teachers, with the assistance of the holders of IK, engage  in  learning  activities  such  as  brewing  (left)  and  the mechanics behind the bow and arrow. This, we argue from an ESDC perspective, enhances cognition.

## Addressing the 'missing link' in STEM education: The affective domain

We feel, therefore we learn

(Immordino-Yang &amp; Damasio 2007:3)

Research in neuroscience highlights the role of the affective domain in learning. Immordino-Yang and Damasio (2007) warn that:

[ ]n  teaching  students  to  minimize  the  emotional  aspects  of  their I academic curriculum and function as much as possible in the rational domain,  educators  may  be  encouraging  students  to  develop  the sorts of knowledge that inherently do not transfer well to real-world situations.  As  prefrontal  damage  patients  show,  knowledge  and reasoning  divorced  from  emotional  implications  and  learning  lack meaning and motivation and are of little use in the real world. (p. 9)

Dubinsky  et  al.  (2013)  explain  this  in  terms  of  synapses  that become  stronger  when  activated  simultaneously  by  multiple inputs. Thus, a combination of sensory perception, motor tasks and emotional involvement will strengthen learning and ensure

its retention. A classic example to illustrate this point is the events of 9/11, when the Twin Towers of the World Trade Centre in New York  were  destroyed  in  terrorist  attacks.  Older  readers  will probably be able to exactly tell what they were doing on this particular day when the news broke. This is because the emotional experience  ensured  that  this  event  is  stored  in  the  long-term memory of a person.

Despite  the  fact  that  research  highlights  the  role  of  the affective domain in learning, the South African schooling system generally neglects affective outcomes and emphasises cognitive learning outcomes (Buma 2018). One of the reasons for this is the 'mania for assessment' (Mbembe 2016) that results in pedagogies that favour transmission-mode, teacher-centred approaches (such as 'chalk-and-talk') at the expense of more inquiry-learning approaches (Ramnarain &amp; Schuster 2014). The latter, we argue, better addresses affective outcomes.

Teachers should  specifically  plan  affective  outcomes.  Rotherham and Willingham (2010:17) said about the achievement of 21st-century skills that it is often 'a matter of chance rather than the deliberate design of our school system […] we cannot afford a system in which receiving a high-quality education is akin to a game of bingo'. We would like to make the same claim regarding the affective domain. Developing students' interest in the science curriculum should be intentionally planned for. And, we claim, IK holds affordances in putting the affective domain centre stage.

In Chapter 3, De Beer and Mentz argue that the holders of IK were,  and  still  are,  self-directed  learners  in  many  cases.  These authors  claim  that  formal  science  education  can  learn  a  great deal from these IK holders. One of the characteristics of learning in  such  informal  environments  is  that  the  affective  domain  is central.  Learning  is  based  on  real,  authentic  problems,  which ensure  learner  interest and  motivation.  The  SLPs  that  are discussed in this chapter, as well as in Chapter 6 and Chapter 9, were therefore designed to promote the affective domain, among others, by contextualising IK in terms of real-life and authentic problems to be solved.

Krathwohl, Bloom and Masia (1964:35) developed a five-level hierarchy  for  the  affective  domain.  In  ascending  order,  the hierarchy includes the following:

- · Receiving - developing an awareness of a phenomenon and a willingness to respond.
- · Responding - active participation with the phenomenon.
- · Valuing - showing an appreciation of the phenomenon.
- · Organisation - incorporating the new knowledge (phenomenon) within a cognitive structure or worldview.
- · Characterisation - the new phenomenon becomes part of a person's value system.

During the SLP, teachers' learning was scaffolded, keeping this hierarchy of the affective domain in mind. An awareness of IK was  firstly  created,  and  teachers  -  through  various  learning activities  -  actively  engaged  with  IK.  Through  multimodal engagement in the learning process, the data obtained showed that teachers started to value IK and such border-crossing in the  classroom  (refer  to  Ch.  2,  Ch.  5  and  Ch.  6).  However, sometimes, radical conceptual change is needed, where teachers hold worldviews that cannot be reconciled with the tenets of IK.

It  is  hoped  that  the  SLPs  assist  teachers  in  developing  an appreciation for IK and a keen interest and motivation to address it in their classrooms. This might spark enthusiasm in the learners and, in turn, provide a new generation of scientists to take South Africa  forward.  Thabo  Mbeki  (1998)  expressed  the  following viewpoint in his African renaissance speech of 1998:

Africa's renewal demands that her intelligentsia must immerse itself in the titanic and all-round struggle to end poverty, ignorance, disease and backwardness, inspired by the fact that the Africans of Egypt were, in some instances, two thousand years ahead of the Europeans of Greece in the mastery of such subjects as geometry, trigonometry, algebra and chemistry. (n.p.)

Perhaps, the new generation of scientists will find inspiration in the country's rich IK, to solve problems like the HIV and AIDS pandemic  and  the  high  unemployment,  to  mention  but  two problems that the country grapples with.

## Objections to teaching indigenous knowledge and controversial conceptual change

Mothwa  (2011)  and  De  Beer  and  Mothwa  (2014)  have  shown that there are many teachers who have objections to teaching IK. One reason for this opposition is teachers' negative perceptions of  IK,  which  are  often  fuelled  by  naïve  understandings  of  the tenets of both IK and science. De Beer and Mothwa (2014:461-462) have captured teacher responses on IK such as '[e]ish [...] some of the (IK) things cannot be scientifically proven'; '[m]any of the learners have negative attitudes towards IK because it is against their religious beliefs'. Cronje (2015:211) captured similar responses from some teachers who said 'it is an ethical problem, as you can be accused of teaching pseudoscience' and 'families sometimes think it is witchcraft'.

The  above  authors  have  shown  that  Christian  teachers  often reject IK owing to its holistic (including metaphysical) nature. These teachers would refer to 'sangomas' or 'diviners' who make contact with the ancestors. Mokgobi (2014:2-3) describes the ancestors as the 'living-dead', compassionate spirits, who act (according to the beliefs of certain cultural groups) as mediators between people and God.  An  objection  from  a  Christian  perspective  would  be  that Christians  communicate  directly  with  God,  through  Jesus  Christ, while  some  traditional  African  believers  communicate  with  God through the medium of deceased relatives (Mokgobi 2014:26).

In the above-mentioned case, some teachers might experience conflict between a phenomenon (e.g. IK) and their own worldviews (e.g.  Christian  values).  Where  IK  is  in  conflict  with  the  religious beliefs that a person holds, conceptual change might be needed. The underpinning theory of conceptual change is Piaget's (1970) cognitive  model  and  schema  theory.  Piaget  (1970:706)  would argue for either the 'assimilation of external elements into evolving or  completed structures' if the differences are negligible, or for 'accommodation (that) is necessary to permit structural change,

the transformation of structures as a function of the new elements encountered' (Piaget 1970:708), where the differences are major.

Carey (1991) is of the opinion that conceptual change requires either  the  re-assignment  of  a  concept  to  a  different  ontological category or the creation of new ontological categories (Vosniadou, Vamvakoussi &amp; Skopeliti 2008). In order for a learner's knowledge and  understanding  to  move  from  his  or  her  'common  sense' conceptions or naïve understandings to more nuanced scientific conceptions, the learner must reorganise or replace the incomplete knowledge structure (Qian &amp; Alvermann 2000). For a person to change well-established concepts is not easy, especially if religion is  involved  (De  Beer  &amp;  Henning  2013).  Pintrich,  Marx  and  Boyle (1993)  show  that  research  on  conceptual  change  is  often  too rational  or  'cold',  not  considering  affective  factors.  De  Beer  and Henning (2013:3) are of the opinion that, where there is a need for radical conceptual change ,  the transformation would include 'warm' cognition.  These  authors  show  that  there  are  many  social  and historical factors that could either enhance or restrict conceptual change.  Considering  these  social  and  affective  factors  would constitute  'warm  cognition'.  Researchers  working  in  the  field  of conceptual  change  generally  'acknowledge  the  important  role played  by  students'  motivational  goals,  their  epistemological beliefs, and various social factors in conceptual change learning' (Qian &amp; Alvermann 2000:60). In this regard, one should recognise the unfortunate history of South Africa. Apartheid South Africa had the notorious Witchcraft Suppression of Act of 1957 (Department of  Justice  1957).  Introduced  in  1895,  it  outlawed  all  forms  of divination. Divination, however, is at the heart of healing in Africa (Ashforth 2005; De Beer &amp; Whitlock 2009:210). Because of such legislation,  many  people,  without  first  studying  African  healing practices,  are  prompted  to  label  it  as  'witchcraft'.  In  the  section entitle 'Should the metaphysical component of indigenous knowledge necessarily be seen as 'pseudoscience'?', we critically look at some traditional healing practices that might be seen as 'witchcraft',  and  we  show  that  there  are  often  very  plausible explanations for these practices.

Hynd  (2003)  suggests  that belief  change should  also  be considered  when  studying  conceptual  change.  According  to Hynd, true conceptual change does not only refer to developing a  better  understanding  of  a  phenomenon  but  also  requires acceptance of the phenomenon.

This places a big responsibility on science teachers. Research shows that (internationally) students have naïve understandings of the purpose, nature and tenets of science (Qian &amp; Alvermann 2000). These authors (Qian &amp; Alvermann 2000) state:

[ T/thinspace ]hat students who hold immature beliefs are less likely to acquire an integrated understanding of particular science concepts, and they are also less likely to change their conceptions once they are formed. (p. 59)

The  epistemological  border-crossing  between  IK  and  Western science, advocated in this book, asks of the teacher to have the necessary knowledge and skills to scaffold the learners' conceptual development,  in  order  to  have  nuanced  understandings  of  the tenets of Western science and indigenous science. This, however, places pressure on teacher educators to ensure that the NOS and IK is  adequately addressed in pre- and in-service teacher education.

## Should the metaphysical component of indigenous knowledge necessarily be seen as 'pseudoscience'?

Cronje, De Beer and Ankiewicz (2015) analysed the tenets of science (as identified by Abd-El-Khalick, Bell and Lederman 1998) and IK (as identified by Cronje 2015). These authors show that Western science and IK share several tenets - both have an empirical nature, are characterised by their tentative nature (theories are subjected to change, based on new knowledge and insights) and are inferential. However, there are also notable differences. Whereas IK is holistic in nature, science is often reductionistic (Cronje et al. 2015). Ongunniyi (2007:965) describes 'indigenous knowledge as a conglomeration of  knowledge systems' that include science, religion,  psychology and other fields. For this reason, IK also has a metaphysical nature.

Gorelick  (2014:43)  states  that  'often  indigenous  sciences  are construed  as  pseudoscience,  despite  being  as  sophisticated  and nuanced  as  Western  sciences'.  This  author  then  shows  -  as  do Cronje et al. (2015) - that Western and indigenous sciences have common procedures; both 'start with prior probabilities (hypotheses);  those  priors  are  updated  with  new  data  (observations), to  form  posterior  probabilities,  or  auxiliary  hypotheses'  (Gorelick 2014:44). The author views science as anything that is Bayesian, sensu lato , and thus uses terminology common in falsificationism.

## Gorelick (2014) expresses the following warning:

We need to distinguish sense from nonsense, and distinguish science from pseudoscience. But we must also realize that westerners do not hold a monopoly on sense and sensible ideas. Judging from the environmental damage  wrought  by  Western  societies,  it  seems  that  indigenous perspectives might be more sensible than Western ones. (p. 51)

Gorelick  refers  to  two  differences  that  might  fuel  the  chasm between  Western  science  and  indigenous  science.  Very  often Western  science  is  saturated  with  'jargon'  (Gorelick  2014:51), whereas  indigenous  sciences  is  not  characterised  by  such complex terminology. Furthermore, indigenous science is often characterised  by  the  embracement  of  metaphors,  whereas Western science has shunned the role of metaphors.

In  this  regard,  we  would  like  to  use  a  few  examples  from the field of ethnobotany to show that there are often plausible explanations for what, at first sight, might  appear  to  be 'pseudoscience'. In the examples that follow, we show that:

- 1. effective plant use is sometimes misunderstood owing to the terminology used (e.g. plants used to keep 'evil spirits' away, while the plants are effective antiseptics, and culturally people might have assigned the cause of disease to 'evil spirits')
- 2.  some  treatments  should  be  viewed  as  psychological,  rather than medical
- 3.  in IKS as oral traditions, metaphors are often used, owing to their  mnemonic  value,  to  ensure  that  people  benefit  from cultural knowledge.

## Impinda ( Adenia gummifera ) and magic

The  very  poisonous  creeper  ' impinda '  ( Adenia  gummifera )  is  a common  plant  sold  at  traditional  markets.  A  decoction  of  the bright-green stems is traditionally sprinkled around the house to inhibit 'evil spirits' (Van  Wyk  2015).  In  Western  households, bleaches and antiseptic products are used for the same purpose, namely,  to  inhibit  microorganisms.  For  people  with  IK,  who are  often  illiterate  and  who  do  not  have  microscopes  to  see microorganisms, 'evil spirits' is the terminology used to describe the germs that cause diseases, and they have realised that ' impinda ' is an effective antiseptic (De Beer &amp; Van Wyk 2016). This serves as an illustration of Gorelick's (2014:51) argument that jargon does not necessarily constitute good science and that 'the best Western science lacks jargon'. Through careful observation, IK holders have realised that impinda is  a  plant  with  strong antimicrobial properties, which could be used in household hygiene.

## Witvergeet ( Asclepias crispa ) and rooivergeet ( Galium tomentosum )

Witvergeet ( Asclepias crispa ) and rooivergeet ( Galium tomentosum )  are powerful medicines in the Khoi-san tradition. The concept of a plant causing forgetfulness in a person is found

in  many  cultures  and  is  perhaps  a  psychological  treatment  to overcome bereavement and the hardships of the hunter-gatherer lifestyle  (De  Beer  &amp;  Van  Wyk  2016).  However,  one  might  also pose the hypothesis that these plants contain chemical substances that, for example, influence neurotransmitters in the brain. Wink and Van Wyk (2008) show that plants contain many secondary metabolites such as alkaloids, cyanogenic glucosides and polypeptides  that  are  psychoactive.  Research  on  these  plants may, in the future, provide plausible explanations of how these plants help people 'to forget'. Van Wyk and Wink (2004) use an interesting  example  to  illustrate  that  Western  science  often  hundreds of years later - provides explanations for indigenous practices.  These  authors  point  to  the  use  of  lime  fruit  ( Citrus limon ) by the British sailors of yore to overcome scurvy. In the olden days, the use of lime to prevent scurvy was probably seen as metaphysical or 'magic'. It took 200 years for modern science to  provide  a  rationale  for  this  practice,  with  the  discovery  of Vitamin C.

## Dawidjiewortel ( Cissampelos capensis )

The Dawidjiewortel , Cissampelos  capensis ,  has  medicinal  uses such as to treat pain, diarrhoea, colic, diabetes, tuberculosis, and stomach and skin cancers (Van Wyk &amp; Gericke 2018; Van Wyk, Van Oudtshoorn &amp; Gericke 2000). However, there are also other uses,  such  as  carrying  the  underground  stem  as  a  good  luck charm  or  chewing  it  to  clear  the  mind  and  improve  mental alertness. The rhizomes may also be burnt in a house to protect it from unwanted influences. The feelings of safety and wellness associated with the latter uses may be linked to the high levels of bisbenzyltetrahydroisoquinoline alkaloids, which have a sedative effect (De Beer &amp; Van Wyk 2016; Van Wyk et al. 2000). Wąsik and Antkiewicz-Michaluk (2012) indicate that the alkaloids have an influence on dopaminergic neurons. Wink and Van Wyk (2008) also  show  that  it  is  a  muscle  relaxant.  The  biochemical  and pharmacological research provides some evidence that there are plausible reasons for the plant's use.

## The resurrection bush, Myrothamnus flabellifolius

An  interesting  example  of  African  psychology  can  be  found in the use  of Myrothamnus  flabellifolius ('uvukwabafile' or 'opstandingsplant')  -  see  Figure  5.5.  Van  Wyk  (2015)  flags  an interesting  characteristic  of  this  plant,  namely,  that  its  leaves become brown and curl up in the dry winter months, giving it an almost dead appearance. If placed in water, it miraculously turns green  within  a  few  hours.  This  plant  is  used  to  treat  people suffering from the trauma of the death of a beloved or depression (C. Mutwa, pers. comm., n.d.). The patient would be instructed by the traditional healer or African psychologist to put the seemingly dead plant in a glass filled with water and place it on a window sill.

Within a few hours, the patient experiences the 'miracle' of the plant 'becoming alive'. This serves to show the patient that there is  always  hope  and  that  there  is  life  after  death  (Van  Wyk  &amp; Gericke 2018:126). This serves to illustrate the holistic nature of African medicine, as a form of IKS.

## The poison bulb, Boophone disticha

The Khoi-san people believed that the bulb of Boophone disticha ( gifbol ; incwadi ; leshoma )  has  the  power  to  transport  the  dead through  the  doorway  of  the  spirit  to  the  life  hereafter.  It  has traditionally  been  used  for  mummification  (Van  Wyk  &amp;  Gericke 2018).  An  interesting  discovery  was  that  of  the  2000-year-old Khoi-san  mummy  in  a  cave  in  the  Baviaanskloof  mountains  in South Africa. The mummy was covered in a thick layer of Boophone bulb scales. The alkaloids are known for their narcotic activity. This powerful hallucinogen is sometimes still used in male adolescent initiation rites and the initiation of diviners (Van Wyk &amp; Gericke 2018). In the Kalahari region of southern Africa, it plays an important role in the traditional San trance dance, facilitating the passage to the 'other world' and typically with a young apprentice appointed for the purpose of ensuring that the healer makes a safe return.

## The use of Aristaloe aristata to protect against lightning

From the examples of evil spirits ( Adenia ) and journeys to other worlds ( Boophone ), it is clear that seemingly inexplicable and lifethreatening, traumatic phenomena have led to innovative attempts at neutralising them. There are several examples of plants that are used in the lightning-prone Drakensberg region (Lesotho and the eastern  Orange  Free  State)  to  ward  off  lightning  or  to  protect people  against  lightning  (Moffett  2010).  In  the  Eastern  Cape province, Aristaloe  aristata (previously Aloe  aristata ),  known  as mthithibala in isiXhosa and umathithibala in isiZulu, is well-known for its use as a protection against lightning, for which it is grown in a  container  on  rooftops  of  huts.  The  related Gasteria croucheri ,

Haworthia fasciata and H. limifolia have the same vernacular names and  are  also  used  for  protection  against  lightning  (Hutchings 1996). It is tempting to speculate that these small succulents with their  erect  and  sharp-tipped  leaves  could  conceivably  act  as protective  devices  from  a  lightning  strike,  with  the  metal  tin  in which they are typically grown serving the purpose of a conductor. Although sharp-tipped devices are no longer considered better that  blunt-tipped  ones,  it  is  noteworthy  that  the  principle  of electrical discharge from a capacitor was originally demonstrated (by Benjamin Franklin) using a sharp-tipped needle (Krider 2006).

The  use  of  plants  for  protection  is  perhaps  most  logically explained by the psychological effects that they have on scared and anxious people. The act of at least trying to do something (rather than being a passive and a helpless victim) probably has a powerful psychological effect. The practice among Afrikaner people to cover mirrors during lightning storms may have the same psychological basis and physiological effect, namely, to relax and reassure.

## The power of metaphor: Dicoma schinzii , the Kalahari koorsbossie

Indigenous  knowledge  is  often  captured  in  metaphor.  St.  Clair (2000:86) notes that, in cultural knowledge, 'metaphors provide a perspective on knowledge just as scientific paradigms provide a perspective on theoretical knowledge'. One very gripping anecdote is that by Van Wyk and Gericke (2000), also described in Dugmore and Van Wyk (2008), on the 'story of the shadow of the blackshouldered kite'. Birds are often metaphors in African IK and often of fever. The story states that the shadow of the black-shouldered kite,  when it  falls  on  a  baby,  could  result  in  illness  (febrile  convulsions). These  convulsions  are  easily  recognised  through  the  spastic movements of the baby's arms (similar to the movements of the wings of the black-shouldered kite), as it hovers over its prey. People believe that, if the condition goes untreated, the baby could develop feathers on his or her arms. Upon closer inspection, the mnemonic value  of  the  story  becomes  clear.  As  mentioned,  in  African  mythology, birds are often used to describe fever. It is interesting to note that

birds have a body temperature of about 40°C, as compared to the human  temperature of 37°C. The symptoms  can  be easily remembered through the story of the black-shouldered kite, which people  often  see  around  them,  regularly  reminding  them  of  the 'threat that the bird poses to babies'. The feathers on the arms is a description of the 'gooseflesh of fever'. The treatment is to (internally and externally) use Dicoma schinzii ( Kalahari koorsbossie ).

St.  Clair  (2000:97)  shows  that  visual  metaphors  provide  a dominant mode of information processing.

## A rationality index for 'magic' plants?

Our hypothesis is that there are often very good explanations for what seems to be 'magic' in IKS. Where plants are used to expel 'evil  spirits',  as  in  the  case  of Adenia  gummifera ,  these  plants often have antimicrobial qualities that could inhibit the growth of  pathogenic  bacteria  or  fungi.  Other  plants  have  powerful symbolic uses when employed in psychological treatments that constitute a holistic approach,  which  is  typical  of African traditional medicine. One such example is the use of Myrothamnus flabellifolius to  treat  depression.  Metaphors  are  described  by St.  Clair  (2000:85)  as  follows:  'Visual  metaphor  is  a  term  that designates how visual space is organised as a means of sharing cultural  and  social  knowledge'.  Metaphors  are  therefore  often used to ensure that this oral IK is passed on to future generations (as it is often not recorded in book form). Mythology is often rich in metaphors, and the story ensures that the message lives on in people's  memories,  because  the  various  critical  elements  and facts  are  connected  and  woven  into  a  'mnemonic  network'. Coman  et  al.  (2016)  state  that  the  development  of  shared memories in communities occurs in dynamic mnemonic networks. An example here is the metaphor of the black-shouldered kite.

De  Beer  and  Van  Wyk  (2011a)  developed  two  indices  for ethnobotanical studies, namely, the EKI and the species popularity index. The examples provided here suggest the need for another index,  namely,  the Rationality  Index  for  Magic  Plants (RIMP) (De Beer &amp; Van Wyk 2016). Clearly, there is a very rational and scientifically plausible explanation for the use of a plant such as Adenia  gummifera as  an  antiseptic,  which  sheds  light  on  the 'magical'  use  to  'suppress  evil  spirits'.  This  would  result  in  a relatively high RIMP. In the case of the use of a magic plant like Galium  tomentosum to  break  witchcraft  spells,  one  senses  an irrational and highly implausible use of the plant. In such a case, the RIMP would be low. However, allowance should be made for psychological and intangible mind-altering effects that may be as real  to  the  sufferer  of  anxiety  or  trauma  than  the  physical  or biochemical  interventions  that  can  be  more  readily  explained.

The formula for calculating RIMP therefore needs to make provision for both the physical and the intangible components of 'magic'.

To conclude, one needs to realise that IKS are holistic, lacking in jargon (like the best Western science, according to Gorelick), and are often captured in metaphor. Gorelick (2014) states that acknowledgement is needed:

[ T/thinspace ]hat  there  are  two  systems  of  knowledge  both  of  which  are empirically testable and both of which are concerned with understanding and guiding practical activity within the same domain of phenomena. (p. 51)

## Implications for pre- and in-service teacher education

As  mentioned  earlier  in  the  chapter,  STEM  teachers  have  to support students' learning and create learning opportunities that will facilitate the development of nuanced understandings of the nature of Western and indigenous science. Unfortunately, many teachers themselves do not have a good understanding of the tenets of science and IK, as can be seen in Table 5.1.

The above pre- and post-intervention data, obtained at the start  of  a  SLP  for  teachers  and  at  the  end  of  the  SLP,  flag  a perturbing  trend.  Of  the  participating  teachers,  only  7.6%  had informed views on the tenets of science and 15.4% on the tenets of IK, at the commencement of the programme. Abd-El-Khalick et  al.  (1998)  show  that  a  relationship  exists  between  teachers'

TABLE 5.1: Teachers' views on the NOS and views on the nature of IK.

views on science and how they teach. If teachers do not have a good understanding of the tenets of science, they might favour transmission-mode,  'teaching-to-the-test'  approaches,  at  the expense of inquiry approaches that better capture the tenets of science (Ramnarain &amp; Schuster 2014). Table 5.1 shows that SLPs can  be  effective  in  providing  teachers  with  more  nuanced understandings of the NOS and IK. There was an increase of 15.5% in the post-test in teachers (23.1%) having informed views of the NOS. In the post-test, 46.2% of teachers had informed views of the nature of IK, an increase of 30.8%.

During  such  interventions,  teachers  should  be  sensitised towards effective pedagogies to teach IK in the STEM classroom. Qian and  Alvermann  (2000:68)  suggest  that  an  effective approach to foster 'students' mature beliefs is to provide students with  opportunities  to  criss-cross  the  landscape  of  a  complex concept (i.e. to examine the concept from different perspectives)'. In  the  SLPs  reported  on  by  Petersen,  Golightly  and  Dudu  in Chapter  5,  such  complexity  was  explored  in  a  CL  fashion,  by making  use  of  De  Bono's  thinking  hats.  Teachers  engaged  in exploring IK from various perspectives.

A problem flagged by Jautse, Thambe and De Beer (2016) is that teacher educators at HEIs often do not have the requisite knowledge and skills to train student teachers in such bordercrossing and infusing IK into curriculum themes. These authors suggest  partnerships  between  universities,  holders  of  IK  and museums in offering such teacher education. A problem that also inhibits the infusion of IK into the curriculum is the lack of learning resources. Because of generous funding provided by the Fuchs Foundation,  the  much-acclaimed People's  Plants (Van  Wyk  &amp; Gericke 2018) could be reworked and printed as a second edition in  2018.  This  book  is  now  provided  to  teachers  during  interventions.

Another concern expressed in terms of teacher education is to consider the entire spectrum of South African cultural diversity when infusing IK into the classroom. The focus should not only be on African IK but also on IK of marginalised groups such as the

Khoi-san (Speight Vaughn &amp; De Beer 2018) and Indians (Reddy, De Beer &amp; Petersen 2017). Such a diverse focus in the classroom could assist  learners  in  developing  higher-order  thinking  skills, such  as  identifying  common  doctrines  of  different  IKS.  Reddy et al. (2017)  studied  Ayurveda,  an  ancient  IK  system  that originated in India 5000 years ago, to see how, for the sake of the many  Indian  learners  in  South  African  schools,  Life  Sciences could be made more accessible and relevant for such students. These  authors  highlight  that  there  are  several  characteristics that  are  common  to  both  African  and  Indian  IKS.  In  both categories,  IK  is  holistic  and  often  embedded  in  the  spiritual. Ayurveda and African  IKS  also  share  the  Theory  of  Signature, which  is  a  primordial  concept  that  one  could  learn  about  the useful properties of plants through careful observation (Reddy et al. 2017; Reddy 2019).

The above also poses a problem for teachers. In a culturally diverse classroom, whose IK should be taught (De Beer &amp; Mothwa 2014)?  Also,  teachers  do  not  have  sufficient  knowledge  of  all these different IKS. This emphasises the need for promoting SDL

among  both  teachers  and  school  learners.  As  Knowles  (1975) puts it, individuals (should):

[ T/thinspace ]ake  the  initiative,  with  or  without  the  assistance  of  others, in diagnosing  their  learning  needs,  formulating  learning  goals, identifying  human  and  material  resources  for  learning,  choosing and  implementing  appropriate  learning  strategies,  and  evaluating outcomes. (p. 19)

A  teacher  and  her  learners  should  therefore  plan  on  learning about Xhosa, Zulu, Venda, Afrikaner, Indian and other IK in a SDL fashion, identifying suitable resources (which could include the holders of IK), deciding upon learning strategies (e.g. Reddy et al. [2017] describe how the value of Ayurveda could be explored in the  classroom,  investigating  the  antimicrobial  activity  of important Ayurvedic plants such as garlic and turmeric, using an adapted  Kirby-Bauer  technique)  and  evaluating  the  outcomes (e.g. learners could work on displays at science expos, based on their classroom research).

## Conclusions and recommendations

From  the  literature,  it  seems  as  if  there  are  two  schools  of thought  regarding  the  status  of  IK  and  the  formal  science curriculum. Some authors argue that IK differs from Western science in terms of both methodology and epistemology and are  therefore  not  in  favour  of  such  border-crossing  in  the science classroom. In this chapter, we have lent our voices to a school of thought that emphasises the fact that Western and indigenous sciences share many tenets and that such epistemological border-crossing could provide students with more relevant and worthwhile learning experiences. We have based our argument on research in the field of neuroscience and claim that IK provides a vehicle in the STEM classroom to address the affective domain.

We would like to illustrate this with a practical example. While doing our ethnobotanical work in the Hantam area in 2009-2012, we interviewed several people to establish their EKI (De Beer 2012;

De  Beer  &amp;  Van  Wyk  2011a;  De  Beer  &amp;  Van  Wyk  2011b).  These participants included Jakob and Martiens Thys. After the study was completed, for the sake of complying with good research ethics, we donated copies of the research to the Calvinia Library. Years  later,  in  2017,  we  started  with  SLPs  for  teachers  in  the Namaqua district (refer to Ch. 5). One of the Calvinia teachers engaged her (Grade 10) learners in an ethnobotanical survey of the region. Henrico Thys, a Grade 10 learner, was so inspired by this assignment, that he went to the library to consult books on the  ethnobotany  of  the  region.  In  the  dissertation  of  De  Beer (2012), he saw the photographs of his uncles (Jakob and Martiens), and this inspired him tremendously. This 'knowledge in the blood', in a Jansen (2009) parlance, provided the motivation for Henrico to engage in an innovative study, and this young man indicated his  interest  to  pursue  tertiary  studies  in  botany.  These  are  the affordances that contextualised teaching and learning holds.

## We conclude with a number of recommendations:

- · Higher  Education  Institutions  (HEIs)  and  teacher  educators should consider how student teachers, during their pre-service training,  could  be  best  equipped  to  facilitate  such  bordercrossing in the classroom. More emphasis should be placed in programmes  on  providing  student  teachers  with  nuanced understandings of the NOS and IK.
- · The  Department  of  Basic  Education  should  provide  more guidance to teachers and subject facilitators on how IK should be incorporated in the CAPS themes.
- · In  the  value  chain  between  the  university  and  schools,  a 'third partner' is needed, namely, holders of IK and museums. Also, teaching and learning resources should be developed to facilitate such border-crossing in the classroom. Funders (e.g.  in  the  case  of  this  project,  the  Fuchs  Foundation) should also become partners in infusing IK into the STEM curriculum.
- · Self-directed  learning  provides  the  key  to  effective  bordercrossing in the STEM classroom. In both pre- and in-service teacher education, learning opportunities should be provided that will enhance SDL.

## Summary

This  chapter  navigates  the  chasm  between  arguments  for  the inclusion  of  IK  in  the  STEM  classroom  and  arguments  against such border-crossing. We start off by advocating for the inclusion of IK in  the  Science  and  Mathematics curricula from a neuroscience perspective, and we use ESDC as the theoretical framework. In this  chapter,  the  affordances  of  such  epistemological  bordercrossing  are  interrogated  in  terms  of  the  affective  domain.  By contextualising the often abstract 'Western' curriculum in terms of relevant (local) IK, learners will experience the learning content as more relevant and accessible, and this might foster affective qualities that could enhance SDL. Research that was done among South African teachers during the past decade shows that many teachers,  however,  are  opposed  to  the  teaching  of  IK.  Their arguments include that IK often constitutes pseudoscience, while some teachers feel that IK is in conflict with their own religious beliefs. We have discussed these views by referring to the tenets of science and IK and the controversial conceptual change that is needed to reconcile IK (in its holistic nature) with personal world views. Next, we look at some of the metaphysical aspects of IK often  the  reason  for  marginalising  it  in  the  formal  science curriculum - namely, 'magic' plants, and we argue that one should look  at  these  aspects  from  a  perspective  that  takes  the  local context into consideration. Very often there are plausible scientific explanations for what at first sight might appear to be metaphysics or even pseudoscience. We conclude the chapter by focussing on what the implications of such border-crossing between IK and 'Western  science'  are  in  terms  of  pre-  and  in-service  teacher education.

## Introduction and problem statement

South Africa remains one of the most unequal societies in the world (Republic of South Africa 2011a). The national development plan  (NDP),  in  its  Vision  for  2030,  predicted  in  2011  that  the country has the capacity to eradicate poverty over the next two decades. As we are now in 2019, there are only 11 years to fulfil this goal in its totality. To reach this objective, the NDP (Republic of  South  Africa  2011a:1)  suggested  that,  one  that  moves  from 'a passive citizenry receiving services from the state' to one that 'systematically includes the socially and economically excluded', where people are 'active champions of their own development' and where government works to 'develop people's capabilities to lead the lives they desire'. The NDP further indicated that this approach can be successful on the premise that the standards of education are raised. In this regard, the recent World Bank Group Systematic  Country  Diagnostic  (SCD)  for  South  Africa,  which explores key development challenges and opportunities for the country,  identifies  five  binding  constraints  for  tackling  poverty and inequality. One of these was that many school and university leavers  do  not  possess  the  appropriate  skills  needed  for  the workplace of the 21st century. According to the Applied Educational Systems (n.d.) website, 21st-century skills comprise 12 abilities that today's students need to succeed in their careers, namely, critical thinking, creativity, collaboration, communication, information literacy, media literacy, technology literacy, flexibility, leadership, initiative, productivity and social skills. To address the insufficient  21st-century  skills  of  its  citizens,  the  SCD  report recommended that South Africa needs to focus on children and young adults as the most critical groups of interest. Policy choices having the most impact should, therefore, include the training of schoolteachers  and  providing  affordable  university  access  to poor students (World Bank 2018).

Based on the recent unrest and debates about the decolonisation  of  the  curriculum,  Disemelo  (2015)  argues  that many students, although they have physical access to universities,

feel disenfranchised because they live in utterly dismal conditions during their studies, and many do not even complete their studies. Zyngier (2004:13) in this regard claims that 'for many marginalised students schools are not seen as the sites of engagement, but of disenfranchisement and alienation'. Schoolwork that is incongruent with a student's cultural commitments can 'assault self-esteem' (Newmann 1996:555). Only 60% of black university students  pass  their  first  year,  and  of  those  only  15%  complete their studies (Le Grange 2016). Many reasons can be offered for this state of affairs, but De Beer and Petersen (2016) argue that one reason may be that students do not have epistemological access to the science curriculum content.

In this chapter, we argue that students' epistemological access to science  curriculum  content  can  be  improved  if  they  have  better access to the curriculum content taught at university and at school. Bolkan and Goodboy (2015) argue that if curriculum content were better contextualised in the life world of the students, it would assist them in better understanding and internalising the content. Gibbons (2000) refers to this type of context-sensitive teaching as Mode 2 knowledge  production  that  addresses  the  affective  domain  of teaching. According to De Beer and Petersen (2016), the affective domain is often neglected in science education because too much emphasis is placed on the cognitive domain. According to these authors, the reasons for the neglect of the affective domain are that many  science  teachers  follow  a  predominantly  content-driven, teacher-centred  approach,  and  many  science  teachers  do  not possess  good  PCK.  Ramnarain  and  Schuster  (2014)  (see  Ch.  3) have  shown  that  many  schools  -  especially  in  townships  -  are characterised by teaching-to-the-test approaches. Engaging pedagogies  such  as  PBL  and  CL  were  introduced  as  teachinglearning strategies where learners (in this context the term 'learners' refers  to  any  person  learning  something,  whether  child  or  adult, school  learner  or  student)  are  active  participants  in  their  own learning processes. For the purposes of this chapter, the authors define  engaging  pedagogies  as  any  inductive  teaching-learning strategy  such  as  PBL,  CL  or  contextualised  learning,  where  the

learners or students are actively involved in the learning process while  developing  21st-century  skills.  This  concept  will  be  further elaborated on in the conceptual framework of this chapter. In order to  better  address  the  affective  domain  in  science  education,  we proposed, for purposes of the research reported in this chapter, to infuse IK with science content into the teaching of science. It was hoped  that  this  would  facilitate  a  border-crossing  between  the Nature  of  Indigenous  Knowledge  (NOIK)  and  the  NOS  and  for the participating teachers to develop a nuanced understanding of the tenets of these two concepts.

The  research  question  around  which  this  qualitative  study revolved  was:  How  can  engaging  pedagogies  facilitate  the epistemological border-crossing between (the tenets of) science and IK? Research such as this, where science teachers' PCK is developed through the infusion of IK into the science content  by  using  engaging  pedagogies,  contributes  to  the debate about the decolonisation of the curriculum. We believe that if the teachers participating in the research implement the newly  acquired  teaching-learning  strategies,  it  may  have  a positive  influence  on  the  academic  performance  and  SDL  of school  learners.  The  positive  influence  on  school  learners' academic performance implies that they will be better equipped with  21st-century  skills  in  order  to  enter  the  workplace  after their school career or to enrol for further studies at a tertiary institution. If tertiary students are exposed to Mode 2 knowledge production, it may well put them in a better position to complete their  studies  with  success.  When  these  school  leavers  and graduates enter the workplace with the necessary 21st-century skills, it may ultimately improve their quality of life. This might have a further domino effect to eradicate poverty towards the goals of the NDP's Vision for 2030.

Next,  the  conceptual-theoretical  framework  on  which  the empirical investigation rested is described. This is followed by an enumeration of the research findings, a discussion of the findings in the light of the theoretical and conceptual framework(s) and some recommendations.

## Conceptual-theoretical framework

The following concepts formed the conceptual framework of this research:

- · the affective domain
- · contextualised teaching and learning
- · engaging pedagogies such as PBL and CL
- · tenets of the NOS
- · tenets of the NOIK
- · science teaching.

These concepts will be discussed in the paragraphs that follow.

## Contextualised teaching: Teaching for the affective domain

South African classrooms and lecture rooms are predominantly characterised by a teacher-centred approach to teaching-learning (Petersen 2011; Ramnarain &amp; Schuster 2014). In a teacher-centred approach, also called the traditional teaching approach, learners are passive during the learning process, while the teacher makes all the decisions regarding the curriculum, the teaching-learning methods  and  forms  of  assessment  (Lak,  Soleimani  &amp;  Parvaneh 2017). One can thus argue that the students are passive recipients of  teachers'  knowledge.  Duckworth (2009) states that teachercentred teaching and learning actually inhibit students' educational growth. In a teacher-centred approach, the focus is largely on the cognitive domain of teaching, while the affective domain is usually neglected  during  teaching.  Gibbons  (2000)  refers  to  such  an approach as discipline knowledge production or Mode 1 knowledge production. In this knowledge production mode, teaching-learning experiences are usually not linked to the learners' life world, and they experience the content taught as dislocated from their dayto-day  life.  By  contrast,  Gibbons  refers  to  Mode  2  knowledge production or context-sensitive knowledge production.

Mode 2 knowledge is  produced  in  a  context  of  application involving  a  range  of  perspectives  -  it  is  transdisciplinary,  is

characterised by a heterogeneity of skills, is socially accountable and reflexive, involves a much-expanded system of quality control and speaks to the affective domain (Gibbons 2000). One of the specific outcomes of the science CAPS curriculum involves the affective domain, stating that 'understanding the applications of science in everyday life, as well as understanding the history of scientific  discoveries  and  the  relationship  between  indigenous knowledge  and  science'  (Republic  of  South  Africa  2011b:11). Science teachers are therefore obliged to teach for the affective domain.

During the research intervention reported in this chapter, science teachers  were  exposed  to  Mode  2  knowledge  production  in designing context-sensitive science teaching-learning experiences. IK,  providing  the  contexts,  was  infused  into  the  science  CAPS content,  making  use  of  PBL  and  CL  as  examples  of  engaging pedagogies. In the paragraphs that follow, the tenets of the NOS and the tenets of the NOIK are explained, after which PBL and CL will be deliberated upon.

## Tenets of the nature of science and indigenous knowledge

One  myth  of  doing  Natural  Sciences  is  that  practitioners  of science, such as lecturers and teachers, believe that a general and universal  scientific  method  exists  (McComas  1998).  McComas further states that there is no single scientific method that can be applied by all scientists universally. However, Mentz and De Beer (2017)  state  that  science  teachers  primarily  use  the  scientific method of investigation as the only empirical approach to find answers about the natural phenomena around them. Allain (2013) argues  that  one  of  the  root  causes  for  the  focus  of  science teachers  on  the  empirical  NOS  is  that  the  scientific  method  is used as the 10 Commandments of science in most school and college  textbooks,  where  the  focus  is  on  evidence-based  and objective  tenets  of  science  (Vhurumuku  2010).  This  may  mean that science learners do not understand the true NOS (Cronje 2015).

This practice is based on the premise that the NOS, as a body of knowledge,  is  based  on  facts,  laws  and  theories  (Vhurumuku 2010).  According  to  Cronje  (2015),  an  empirical  and  objective approach to science investigations leads to overlooking the  tenets  of  science  as  subjective,  socially  constructed  and creative. Human creativity and imagination plays a role in doing science (Abd-El-Khalick, Bell &amp; Lederman 1998). In this regard, Clough (2004) claims that if the NOS is accurately and effectively taught, it will help the students to better understand the role of science in social decision-making.

In order for science teachers to make it a reality in classrooms, what Clough (2006) named 'context of everyday science' and 'authentic  science',  we  propose  to  infuse  IK  as  an  authentic context into science curriculum content.

Indigenous knowledge encompasses a wide-ranging number of characteristics, and there is no single definition for this concept (Senanayake  2006).  However,  in  this  chapter,  we  have  used Agrawal's  (1995:418)  definition  of  IK,  stating  it  as  'IK  is  the common  sense  knowledge  and  ideas  of  local  peoples  about everyday realities of living'. Cronje (2015:322) lists a number of tenets  of  the  NOIK,  namely,  (1)  'empirical  and  metaphysical  in nature;  (2)  resilient  yet  tentative;  (3)  inferential  yet  intuitive; (4) creative and mythical; (5) subjective; (6) social, collaborative and cultural; (7) wisdom in action; (8) functional application and (9)  a  holistic  approach'.  In  Table  6.1,  Cronje  (2015)  draws  a comparison between the NOIK and the NOS.

In  her  research,  Cronje  (2015)  indicated  that  many  science teachers do not possess the necessary PCK to actualise the CAPS curriculum with regard to using IK in their lessons. These authors further  argued  that  the  reason  for  this  non-compliance  is  that teachers  do  not  have  an  understanding  of  the  NOIK.  The intervention, a SLP, which is the focus of the research reported in this chapter, therefore aimed to expose and train science teachers about  the  NOS  and  the  NOIK  in  order  for  them  to  make  the border-crossing between IK and 'Western' science.

It must be kept in mind  that the elders' repository of ways of  knowing is the truth and is not to be  challenged.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |          2 | Tentative NOS Science is subject to change and  not absolute and certain.

|          3 | Inferential yet intuitive NOIK Facts are tested and experimental  observations made.

|          4 | Creative and mythical NOIK Observations and experimenting  are not the only sources of ways of  knowing.

|          5 | Subjectivity of NOIK Indigenous ways of knowing are based  on cosmology and are interwoven with  culture and the spiritual.

|          6 | Social, collaborative and cultural NOIK Indigenous knowledge is situated in  cultural tradition and within a certain  historical-political context. It is the  consequence of activities connected to  everyday life in the natural environment  of a group of people. It does not focus  on the individual, but on the group and  sharing. Indigenous knowledge is locally  rooted and ecologically based. It is  generated at a specific place by people  of that place. Generalisations are relative  within a certain context and can be  shared among communities and beyond. |          6 | Social and cultural NOS Scientists try to be objective, but  science is a human endeavour  and is therefore affected by  a social and cultural milieu.  Scientists do sometimes work  individually. Science is generated  at a specific place and thus  local, but generalised, scientific  laws and theories have universal  applications. |

IK, indigenous knowledge; NOS, nature of science; NOIK, nature of indigenous knowledge.

During  the  intervention,  science  teachers  learnt  about  the NOS  and the NOIK using engaging pedagogies, namely, contextualised learning, PBL  and  CL.  Participating science teachers  also  got  the  opportunity  to  choose  topics  from  the curriculum to design teaching-learning experiences, suitable for a  particular  engaging  pedagogy  as  mentioned  above.  In  the paragraphs that follow, the concept of engaging pedagogies will be described with appropriate examples.

## Engaging pedagogies

Schools need to 're-engage with the disengaged' (Zyngier 2004:3). This  author  is  referring  to  the  disengaged  (alienated)  as  those learners  (and  students)  that  are  at  risk,  disadvantaged  or  from low  socio-economic  backgrounds.  In  the  South  African  context, re-engagement  is  necessary  to  reach  all  school  learners  and students, from all social spheres, in their places of learning in order to  give  them  a  better  chance  of  academic  success,  which  will contribute to social cohesion, social justice, prosperity and peace. Higher  levels  of  engagement  in  schools  will  encourage  lifelong learning and the development of 21st-century skills (Fullarton 2002).

Zyngier  (2004)  claims  that  student  engagement  can  be regarded as an important precursor for learning in students' own lives  and for their own learning at school. Newmann (1989:34) defines engagement as 'the students' psychological investment in learning, comprehending and mastering of knowledge or skills'. Ryan and Deci (2009, cited in Saeed &amp; Zyngier 2012) argue that student involvement in learning is a means for students achieving sound academic objectives, which may lead to higher academic achievement throughout a student's life (Zyngier 2008). Zyngier (2004:10)  further  argues  that  a  'student-centred  pedagogy envisages engagement as implicit in active learning where selfmotivation,  reflective  shared  goals  setting  and  student  choice are located in the lived experiences of the students'. The Centre for Holistic Teaching and Learning equates engaging pedagogy with 'inductive teaching and learning', which, according to Prince and Felder (2006), is a process of learning where the learners discover  facts,  rules, procedures  and  guiding  principles  by observing examples. This definition of inductive learning opposes deductive learning, where learners are given general rules and principles that they then need to apply in new situations. Inductive learning has the following features in common:

- · it is learner-centred, constructivist
- · promotes active learning and CL
- · is also known as discovery learning.

According to Prince and Felder (2006), inductive learning can be regarded as a concept that incorporates a number of teaching and learning  strategies,  such  as  PBL,  case-based  learning,  projectbased learning and inquiry learning. For the purposes of the study reported in this chapter, engaging pedagogies is defined as any inductive teaching-learning strategy, such as PBL, CL and contextualised  learning,  where  the  learners  and  students  are actively  involved  in  the  learning  process  while  developing  their 21st-century skills. In the paragraphs that follow, PBL and CL, as examples of engaging pedagogies, will be elaborated upon.

## Problem-based learning

The integration of IK into the formal science curriculum requires the implementation of innovative teaching and learning strategies.

One teaching and learning strategy that adheres to this is PBL. Problem-based  learning  was  originally implemented  in  the medical  education  curricula  in  Canada's  McMaster  University Medical  School  in  the  late  1960s  (Schwartz,  Mennin  &amp;  Webb 2001). Soon afterwards, PBL was also integrated in Engineering and Nurse Education curricula around the world. PBL has only recently come to the fore in teacher education as well as primary and secondary school education (Borhan 2014; De Simone 2014; Golightly &amp; Muniz 2013). Possible reasons for this are that PBL represents a radical  shift  in  educational  thinking  from  a  direct instructional  approach  to  an  active  learning  approach.  The integration  of  PBL  in  a  programme  or  module  necessitates changes in curriculum, teaching, learning and assessment strategies that are often unfamiliar to lecturers, teachers, students and learners (Barron et al. 1998). It is no secret that PBL challenges the dominant cultures of university and school teaching and that teachers, acting as facilitators, may face difficulty in facilitating discussions  in  collaborative  learning  environments  (Ngeow  &amp; Kong  2001).  Most  authors  agree  that  students  and  educators have  a  difficult  time  with  the  transition  from  lecture-based teaching to PBL and need a period of induction and orientation

to  the  processes  of  how  to  take  responsibility  for  your  own learning (Boud &amp; Feletti 1997; Miller 2000).

In a PBL environment, the focus is on students and learners solving real-world problems, rather than being taught by lecturers or  teachers  (Borhan  2014;  De  Simone  2014;  Golightly  &amp;  Muniz 2013). In the PBL process, an ill-structured, real-world problem (one to which there are many possible solutions) is presented to the students first. The students and learners may be organised into small PBL tutorial groups where group members collaborate as a team (Dolmans et al. 2001). The students or learners discuss the  problem  and  formulate  more  specific  learning  objectives. These learning objectives are then conceptualised into various learning tasks, whereafter group members have to consult various resources, articles, textbooks and field studies. They come back to the next PBL tutorial session with new information to share and work on the problem together (Lam 2009). After the students or learners have discussed and analysed the learning objectives in their tutorial groups, they formulate multiple solutions to the stated problem (Tick 2007). The different groups can also report back to the rest of the groups on the possible solutions they have formulated. During the PBL process, the lecturer or teacher acts as  a  facilitator  or  tutor.  The  facilitator  or  tutor  guides  the conversation  between  group  members,  provides  appropriate scaffolds  that  give  support  to  students  or  learners,  monitors the progress and assesses each group member's contribution to the group's work (Schmidt et al. 2009).

In PBL, when the group members are formulating solutions to the stated problem, it is necessary, in most cases, to cross academic disciplinary  borders.  Interestingly,  Dahms  and  Stentoft  (2008) noted that the implementation of PBL  may  assist in the implementation of Africanised (indigenous) knowledge, owing to the focus on identifying and applying local, formal and informal knowledge in solving local real-world problems, situated in a social context rather than in a textbook. With the implementation of PBL in the school curriculum, learners use local IK, to the local context and to the local needs of the community (Dahms &amp; Stentoft 2008).

In this regard, De Villiers, De Beer and Golightly (2018) are of the opinion that in a PBL environment, IK can be infused into teaching and learning activities based on the tenets of the NOS.

With the design, planning and implementation of PBL activities to infuse IK into the formal science curriculum, it is important to train,  assist  and  guide  teachers  in  the  process.  To  illustrate  the contextualisation of a real-world PBL activity in science education, the following example adapted from Golightly (2018) can be used:

As a Life Science learner in a school situated in a squatter settlement on the periphery of a town in South Africa, you become aware that the  Life  Sciences  learners  in  your  school  are  absent  on  a  regular basis. In discussions with the different role players as well as the clinic sisters at the nearby medical clinic, the poor health conditions in this squatter camp are identified as the main reason. The governing body of the school asked you and your fellow learners to formulate possible solutions to the poor health problems of learners in the area. (p. 438)

In the  above-mentioned  real-world,  ill-structured  problem,  the learners working on this problem had access to contextualised local knowledge on living conditions in a low-income area around a town in  South  Africa,  while  also  having  access  to  substantial  scientific knowledge on poor health conditions  in  low-income  areas.  Combining the two types of knowledge allows the learners to formulate solutions to problems typical of South African towns and cities.

Unfortunately, teachers in a South African context often lack the PCK to infuse IK into the contents of the sciences curriculum. Against this background, 'the affordances of indigenous knowledge for self-directed learning' project was designed and implemented in a three-day SLP. The purpose of the SLP was mainly  to  develop  the  PCK  of  teachers  with  regard  to  the implementation  of  engaging  pedagogies  and  IK  education  in order  to  empower  them  to  facilitate  SDL  processes  in  their classrooms (De Villiers et al. 2018). An example of a PBL activity in  the  SDL  is  that  teachers  (in  small  groups)  have  to  plan  a learning  opportunity  where  learners  have  to  determine  the efficacy  of  traditionally  used  medicinal  plants  by  engaging  in laboratory protocol typical of microbiology labs.

## Cooperative learning

According  to  Johnson,  Johnson  and  Johnson-Holubec  (2008), groups have existed for as long as there have been humans. In a timeline of the development of CL, Johnson et al. stated that learners have benefitted from teaching one another as early as the 1st century. By  the  turn  of  the  19th  century,  Francis  Parker  was  describing instructional methods of how to structure cooperation in classrooms. During the mid-1960s, these authors trained teachers in America on how to implement CL effectively. Based on literature (ResourcEd 2017), when it comes to group work, the terms collaborative learning and CL come to  the  fore.  Some  authors  use  the  terms  interchangeably and  others  as  two  separate  concepts.  However,  there  are  some differences  and  similarities.  ResourcEd  (2017)  lists  some  of  the similarities, for example, both rely on active student participation rather than passive, lecture-based teaching; both require learners to complete a task; the teachers act as facilitators to learning; both create  shared  learning  experiences;  and  both  embrace  student diversity. Although there are more differences, the most important difference is that with collaborative learning, students  make individual progress in tandem with others while CL involves more inherent interdependence, promoting greater accountability (ResourcEd 2017). In this chapter, we use the two terms as separate concepts and prefer to use the term CL.

Cooperative learning can be regarded as a teaching-learning strategy based on constructivist principles. Sandi-Urena, Cooper and Stevens (2012:701) define CL 'as a student-centred, active learning approach that uses structured situations in which fixed small groups interact in a non-competitive manner to accomplish a common goal'. Johnson and Johnson (1994) define CL as group work  that  occurs  when  students  work  cooperatively  in  small groups to complete common goals. These authors further argue that CL can only be successful if the following basic elements are present  in  a  teaching-learning  experience,  namely,  positive interdependence,  individual  accountability,  promotive  face-toface  interaction, interpersonal  small-group  skills  and  group processing.  To  further  optimise  the  effectiveness  of  the  CL

experience, these authors advise that there should not be more than  four  groups  (Johnson  &amp;  Johnson  1994).  The  research reported  in  this  chapter  leans  heavily  on  CL  as  described  by Johnson  and  Johnson  (1994).  These  five  essential  elements, according to the descriptions of Johnson and Johnson (1994), are described below:

- · Positive interdependence, perhaps the most important element of CL, is described as the heartbeat of CL or the 'sink or swim together' principle. Positive interdependence occurs 'when students perceive that they are linked with group mates in  such  a  way  that  they  cannot  succeed  unless  their  group mates do (and vice versa) and/or that they must coordinate their efforts with the efforts of their group mates to complete a  task'  (Johnson  &amp;  Johnson  1994:2).  During  a  CL  lesson, positive  interdependence  can  be  scaffolded  in  one  of  the following ways: 'positive goal interdependence; positive reward  interdependence;  positive  resource  interdependence; positive role interdependence' (Johnson &amp; Johnson 1994:2). In the SLP, such CL is particularly relevant. Jautse, Thambe and De  Beer  (2016)  showed  that  traditionally  this  element  of positive interdependence had been part of learning in informal, IK settings.
- · Individual accountability entails that each member in the group is held accountable and responsible for his or her segment of the work in order to reach the common goal. It is important to mention that although the group learns together, it is crucial that 'group members should be better prepared to complete similar tasks by themselves' (Johnson &amp; Johnson 1994:4).
- · Face-to-face  promotive  interaction  is  defined  as  individual members of  the  group  encouraging  and  helping  each  other in  their  efforts  to  reach  the  group's  shared  goals.  Johnson and  Johnson  (1994:3)  state  that  'promotive  interaction  is characterized by individuals providing each other with efficient and effective help and assistance; exchanging needed resources, such as information and materials; and processing information more  efficiently  and  effectively;  providing  each  other  with feedback in order to improve their subsequent performance'; etc. The groups can be physically structured so that members can sit knee-to-knee to facilitate interaction.

- · Interpersonal and small-group skills (social skills) are cultivated during  a  CL  activity.  These  skills  include,  among  others, believing in each other, communicating effectively, accepting and supporting each other, and resolving conflict beneficially.
- · Group processing refers to the process during a CL activity where the group members need to determine, through selfreflection  and  group-reflection,  if,  or  how  well,  they  have achieved  their  mutual  goals.  Based  on  their  reflection,  the group members need to adapt their plans in order to reach the goal in time.

During a CL activity, the teacher acts as a facilitator in terms of planning  the  learning  experience,  making  sure  that  all  the resources are in place, and using suitable scaffolds while executing the learning experience. Guided by the curriculum content, the teacher can use one of the following CL teaching methods:

- · Jigsaw
- · GIG ('Group-Individual-Group')
- · Note-taking-pairs
- · Cooperative graffiti
- · De Bono's thinking hats
- · Think-pair-share (Lubbe 2015; Petersen &amp; Mentz 2016).

Cultural-Historical Activity Theory will now be described as the research lens of this study.

## Cultural-Historical Activity Theory

Teaching is a complex and challenging career and is characterised by  constant  and  continuous  curriculum  change  and  therefore teachers' ongoing need for opportunities for their own professional development. In the study reported in this chapter, in-service teachers attended an SLP with the aim of contributing to participating teachers' PD. Third-generation CHAT, as described by Engeström (1987), was used as a research lens to examine the socially constructed actions of the participating science teachers during and after the SLP. The concept, the ZPD, first coined by Vygotsky (1978), implies that learning takes place on two levels. Firstly, on a social plane and, secondly, on a personal plane where

the learning is internalised. For effective learning to take place over  the  ZPD,  a  learner  needs  to  be  provided  with  suitable scaffolds by a teacher (facilitator) or a more knowledgeable peer to a point where the learner can act independently and internalise the newly learnt content (Mentz &amp; De Beer 2017).

Cultural-Historical  Activity  Theory  can  be  used  in  understanding human cognition by exploring the relationships between people, tools and goals, as they are shaped by social structures, culture and history within a community (Engeström 1987). The activity system can be regarded as the primary unit of analysis in CHAT. (Refer  to  Ch.  2  for  a  more  detailed  discussion  on  CHAT.)  The activity  system  of  this  study  refers  to  the  professional  development of science teachers during an SLP in order to improve their PCK with  regard  to  context-sensitive  science  teaching  as  the  goal. Engeström  (1987)  describes  an  activity  system  having  five elements. The object, or objective, is the product of the activity system in order to meet a human need and usually provides an insight  into  why  people  perform  different  actions  (Engeström 2000). The object of the activity system of this study is to develop the  subject's  PCK  (and  understanding  of  the  NOS  and  NOIK) with regard to contextualised teaching. The subject refers to the people engaged in the activity system - the science teachers, in the context of this study. In an activity system, the subject's main goal is to reach the outcome, and in the process, their identities and knowledge are shaped and transformed by interacting with the  other  elements  in  the  activity  system  (Roth  &amp;  Lee  2007). Tools are used to mediate every human action and experience and can be internal, external, psychological or material (Vygotsky 1978). The choice of selecting a tool by the subject directs the way the subject acts in order to reach the outcome (Kaptelinin, Kuuti &amp; Bannon 1995). All the individuals or groups sharing the goal  of  the  activity  system  constitute  the  community  of  an activity system. Because all the individuals usually do not possess all the knowledge and skills to fulfil the goal, they enact different roles  with  each  other  (Jonassen  &amp;  Rohrer-Murphy  1999).  The community negotiates a set of rules, and/or uses the sociocultural conventions dictated by the culture of the community to guide

the activities of the subject (Trust 2017). 'Division of labour' refers to the different roles of the subject, for example, a teacher, in the activity system - as a facilitator of learning, as a self-directed learner or as a reflective practitioner.

According to Mentz and De Beer (2017), CHAT can be used in one of three ways, on a personal plane, an interpersonal plane or an institutional plane (refer to Ch. 2). In this research, CHAT was used on a personal plane, as described by Rogoff (1995), where the subject is the teacher. Two sub-activity systems, firstly, the science teachers during  the  SLP  (intervention)  and,  secondly,  the  same  science teachers  in  their  implementation  in  the  classroom  after  the  SLP (Figure 6.1) were compared. The complexities of the 'objects' of the two  interlinked  sub-activity  systems  will  be  highlighted  in  the discussion below and the 'contradiction of control' (McNeil 2013) between the two objects will also be illustrated.

## Empirical investigation: The short learning programme, research methodology and ethics

The research reported on in this chapter was a large-scale qualitative, design-based project within an interpretative paradigm. The study investigated the integration of IK into the science curriculum through the use of different engaging pedagogies. In order to reach this goal,  the  researchers  developed  SLPs  in  Life  Sciences,  Natural Sciences and Physical Sciences presented in different cycles to the participating science teachers. Table 6.2 represents a summary of these interventions (presentation of SLPs).

Each cycle of the intervention consists of the following phases:

- · Phase  1:  Planning  of  the  different  SLPs  and  relevant  data collection instruments.
- · Phase 2: Development of teaching-learning materials.
- · Phase 3: Presentation of the SLPs and data collection.
- · Phase 4: School visits to observe participating science teachers.
- · Phase 5: Using CHAT as a lens to determine tensions and to identify new design principles to improve the SLPs for the next cycle.

TABLE 6.2: Summary of three cycles of SLPs.

SLP, short learning programme.

Most of the SLPs (see Table 6.2) were presented over a period of 3  days  and  all  the  other  SLPs  over  a  period  of  2  days  in  the different places as outlined in Table 6.2. (In the case of 2-daylong  SLPs,  the  teachers  did  not  engage  with  holders  of  IK  in museums, as in the case of 3-day-long SLPs). On day one (for the first two  SLPs),  participating teachers  visited museums  in Polokwane  (Bakone  Malapa)  and  Moruleng,  near  Rustenburg (Mphebatho Museum), and had the opportunity to meet with the holders of IK (see Figure 6.1).

During the first day, participating teachers were exposed to exhibitions and discussions about different aspects of IK, such as ethnobotany,  sustainable  use  of  water  by  their  ancestors  and traditional leather tanning. They were also engaged in brewing and  tasting  traditional  beer,  made  clay  pots,  ate  traditional delicatessen  like  mopane  worms,  did  drumming  and  played traditional  games  such  as Morabaraba . Engagement  with  all these activities placed these teachers in an IKS epistemological space and contributed to their true understanding of the NOIK and the different cultural practices of the Bakgatla and Bafokeng tribes. Because of time and financial constraints, the visits to the museums were excluded from some of the SLPs.

Days two and three of the three-day SLPs, and days one and two for the rest, were used to expose the teachers to the use of different engaging pedagogies, such as CL, PBL, inquiry learning, science-on-a-shoestring and contextualised learning approaches. The  purpose  of  the  intervention  was  to  contribute  to  these teachers' better understanding of the NOIK and the NOS, in order for  them  to  get  rid  of  any  misconceptions  and  their  initial understanding that the NOIK and the NOS were two opposing concepts.  The  activities  conducted  during  the  SLP  exposed teachers to methods that can be used where the NOS and NOIK can complement each other in the science classroom. All activities over the 3-day period were done using CL (see Figure 6.2), as described by Johnson and Johnson (1994).

During  all  CL  activities,  efforts  were  made  to  explore  the different elements of CL. The CL methods used were the jigsaw

method and De Bono's five thinking hats. In order to expose the teachers to the use of contextualised science teaching, one of the  activities,  based  on  inquiry  learning  principles,  was  to design and execute an experiment in testing the healing effects of traditional plants (ethnobotany). In this regard, the participating teachers executed this inquiry-based experiment (an  adapted  Kirby-Bauer  experiment)  in  a  real  laboratory (see  Figure  6.3).  The  researchers  assumed  that  working  in  a 'real'  laboratory,  facilitated  by  a  microbiologist,  will  make  the teachers aware and expose them to a more nuanced understanding of the NOS. This experiment also covered the tenets  of  science  such  as  its  creativity  and  that  it  is  socially constructed. In another activity, also based on a contextualised science teaching approach, teachers were trained in using case studies  as  a form  of  PBL  in  designing  teaching-learning activities for their learners.

## Ethics

In cooperation with the different departments of basic education in  the  different  provinces,  an  open  invitation  was  given  to  all science teachers who wished to participate in the SLP. As part of the  invitation,  all  information  regarding  the  intervention  was provided to prospective participants in order to make voluntary informed consent to participate or not in the research. They were given the assurance that their participation in the research would be  voluntary,  that  they  did  not  have  to  complete  the  data instruments even if they participated in the intervention, or made themselves  available  for  observation  in  their  classes.  Ethics clearance was obtained from NWU. The science teachers were also informed that they could withdraw from the research at any stage without any negative consequences and that their identities would be protected during the reporting phase of the research

using  pseudonyms.  Teachers  signed  model  release  forms  that provided  permission  to  publish  photographs  in  which  they appear; however, we have blurred their faces in the photographs used in this chapter.

The following data gathering instruments were used during and after the intervention:

- · Preand  post-questionnaires (perceptions of the NOIK, perceptions  of  the  NOS  and  a  questionnaire  to  determine teachers' perceptions of their knowledge and skills regarding PBL).
- · Both individual and focus group interviews were performed during the SLP and during school visits.
- · School visits to observe participating science teachers in their classes to determine if transfer of knowledge and skills, gained during  the  SLPs,  did  occur.  The  standardised  Reformed Teaching  Observation  Protocol  (RTOP)  (Sawada,  Piburn  &amp; Judson 2002) was used for this purpose.
- · Artefacts, such as teachers' lesson plans and reflection notes, were studied.

Transana and Atlas.ti were used to analyse the qualitative data (transcriptions of interviews, RTOP, artefacts). Data were analysed using Saldaña's (2009)  coding  system  where  codes  were identified,  categories  formed  and  from  which  a  number  of emerging themes could be identified.

## Analysis of views-on-the-nature-ofindigenous-knowledge instrument data

Views-on-the-nature-of-indigenous-knowledge (VNOIK) data were analysed using the method described by Cronje, De Beer and  Ankiewicz  (2015:328).  A  rubric  was  used  to  assess  the answers of respondents to the instrument items. Each response was (Cronje et al. 2015):

[ C ]oded as an informed view (I), a partially informed view (PI) or an uninformed view (UI) on indigenous knowledge. An uninformed view scored 0 points, a partially informed view scored 1 point, and an

informed view scored 2 points. The predominant category for each teacher was obtained by calculating the average. (p. 328)

In order to improve the quality of the interventions in consecutive SLPs, different design principles were distilled. In the first cycle, 62 teachers participated, but only 34 submitted their portfolios, of which only 24 portfolios obtained a pass mark of 50%. In order to  improve  the  submission  rate,  participating  teachers  in  the second and third cycles were encouraged to do the submissions online, in hard copy and/or in smaller parts. Only a few teachers made themselves available for visits in their classrooms, and it was found that in most cases transfer of knowledge and skills did not take place. In some instances, the teachers that were visited indicated that a lack of resources contributed to them not using the newly acquired teaching-learning methods. In cycles 2 and 3, teachers were also provided with science-on-a-shoestring resources  to  be  used  in  their  classrooms.  These  resources included a fold scope (a paper microscope having a magnification of up to 2000x costing only $1, resources to do the Kirby-Bauer test in the classroom, an optics kit, kit to test for water quality, etc.). Going hand-in-hand with the provided resources, teachers were also exposed to the use of more common products such as garlic  and  turmeric  in  the  Kirby-Bauer  tests  and  to  use  the examples of different cultural and racial groups. For instance, a tailor-made  SLP  was  offered  in  Lenasia,  with  a  broader  focus than just African IK, but also incorporating Ayurveda (Indian IK), in  contextualising  CAPS  themes.  Yet  another  design  principle built into the follow-up interventions was exposing participating science teachers to the use of CAR. This design principle was included  because  it  was  found  that  the  low  pass  rate  on  the portfolios  in  the  first  cycle  was  owing  to  the  fact  that  the participating teachers did not possess good reflection abilities. It was  hoped  that  such  an  addition  would  develop  participating science teachers' reflective practices. A 'one-size-fits-all' approach  does  not  work,  and  in  the  third  cycle,  participating teachers' needs were identified in order to change the content of the SLPs accordingly to serve the specific needs of these teachers.

Reliability  was  ensured  by  using  suitable  and  thorough  data collection strategies contributing to the thoroughness of the data obtained. Multiple data sources were used for triangulation purposes over an extended period of time. Triangulating the different data sources  contributed  to  the  trustworthiness  of  the  research.  The findings of this research cannot be generalised, however, but if the same  methodology  were  used  in  similar  environments,  it  might deliver  comparable  results.  Onwuegbuzie,  Johnson  and  Collins (2009) refer to this type of generalisation as case-to-case transfer. According to Shenton (2004), the purpose of such a study should not be to get the same results, but rather to get an overall picture of the phenomenon or group of people under study.

## Findings and discussion

The main goal of the research reported in this chapter was to determine how engaging pedagogies could be used to facilitate border-crossing between the NOIK and the NOS. Numerous data sources were analysed, and several themes arose from the data analysis. These  themes  will  be  discussed  in the following paragraphs.  The  first  part  of  the  discussion  will  deal  with  the findings made regarding engaging pedagogies that were used during the intervention. Thereafter, the discussion will reveal to what  extent  engaging  pedagogies  have  contributed  to  the epistemological border-crossing between NOIK and NOS.

## Findings with regard to cooperative learning

With the onset of the intervention, participating teachers had limited knowledge  of CL, but after the intervention there was  an improvement in their knowledge about CL and how to implement it.

Before  the  intervention  (data  from  the  pre-questionnaires), teachers' responses varied between very little knowledge about CL to some teachers who seemingly had a superficial understanding of

the term, but many confused CL with traditional group work. One teacher commented, '[n]ot really well informed. Still need support. I do improvise where necessary' (cited in Jacobs 2018:128). Many teachers  were  aware  of  group  work  as  a  method  to  facilitate learning  and  many  used  it.  However,  group  work,  as  the  participating science teachers understood it, is not the same as CL. Cooperative learning, as described by Johnson and Johnson (1994), can only be  successful  if  all  five  elements  mentioned  earlier  are  present during  the  learning experience  while  group  members  work together to reach a common goal. One participant stated, '[v]ery familiar [CL], but I know it as group work' (teacher, undisclosed gender, date unknown). Another participant was not aware of the term CL itself, but knew that the notion of 'cooperative' signified 'people working together in small groups' as he or she wrote, 'has to do with group work, teamwork where the teacher direct, but learners  work  on  their  own'  (teacher,  undisclosed  gender,  date unknown). It can thus be deduced that many teachers were not aware of the term themselves, but that they knew that the term 'cooperative' indeed refers to people who work together in small groups or teams. Some teachers structured their group work on the principles of the jigsaw method but were unaware of the term 'jigsaw'. 'I often administer it, it [is] just that I was not familiar with the jigsaw model of cooperative learning and the De Bono hats' (Jacobs 2018:131).

Based on the responses of the participating science teachers in  the  post-questionnaires, it can be inferred that their knowledge and  comprehension  about  CL  did  improve.  What  half  of  the participants  wrote  in  the  post-questionnaires  supports  this finding. ' After the intervention, I clearly understand  that cooperative learning involves different teaching methods such as the jigsaw method and the De Bono's Hats method' (cited in Jacobs 2018:129). Another teacher stated that 'at first I did not know what it was and it is only now after attending the course that I understand  it' (cited in Jacobs  2018:129),  and  yet another  response  was  that  'learners  should  be  able  to  learn cooperatively  as  a  group,  be  able  to  share  ideas  to  achieve

positive interdependence' (cited in Jacobs 2018:245). One question on  the  post-questionnaire  was:  Did  this  short  course  change your  views  on  the  use  of  CL  methods  in  the  Life  Sciences classroom?  Of  all  the  teachers  who  completed  the  generic questionnaire,  59.68%  indicated  that  the  SLP  changed  their perceptions  on  CL  positively.  A  further  40.32%  said  the  SLP brought about a change in their perception of CL.

Three  months  after  the  intervention,  all  science  teachers who  attended  the  SLP  were  requested  for  consent  to  visit them at their schools to observe a lesson and to study their artefacts (lesson plans, reflection notes and learners' workbooks). Only four of the  75  teachers  that  attended  the Limpopo workshop availed this opportunity. After the intervention in Lenasia, only five participating teachers gave consent to be observed. The RTOP instrument was used for the observations. Although a large group of teachers (59.68%) indicated  that, after the  intervention, they  had  a  better understanding of CL, the observations showed otherwise. In not  one  of  the  lessons  observed,  it  was  apparent  that  the teachers  possessed  adequate  skills  to  design  and  present elective  CL  lessons.  The  five  basic  elements  of  CL  were  not evident during the lessons. However, we need to mention that the  environment  was  not  conducive  to  practice  CL,  as  the classes visited in the Limpopo schools were overcrowded with learners, and in some  classes, there were not enough tables and chairs. There is a discrepancy between knowledge  and  skills  in  the  use  of  CL.  Reddy  (2019)  found that regardless  of  the  teacher  development  programmes that  the  teachers  attended,  they  continued  to  teach  in  the manner in which they were taught. The teaching approaches remained  teacher-centred  with  little  evidence  of  the  use  of inquiry techniques. The fact that the furniture in most of the classes  was  arranged  in  a  manner  that  made  CL  difficult  to implement should be acknowledged. The teachers mentioned a number of reasons for the non-use of CL; this will be explained later in this chapter.

## Findings with regard to problem-based learning

At  the  onset  of  the  intervention,  participating  teachers  had limited knowledge of PBL, but after the intervention there was an improvement in their knowledge about PBL and their attitude towards implementing PBL.

The data reported in the pre-questionnaires indicated that although  some  of  the  participants  possessed  knowledge about  PBL,  most  of  them  had  very  little  or  no  knowledge about PBL. Most of the teachers also indicated that they did not  know  how  to  implement  PBL  and  therefore  refrained from  using  it as a teaching-learning  strategy.  Some  of the comments of the teachers support this finding (cited in De Villiers 2018):

'I do not know what problem-based learning is'; 'I read about it before, but I was not fully engaged with it'; 'It's better to explain the work to learners, I don't like doing things in class where learners just do what they want'. (p. 324)

Reading the last comment made by one of the science teachers, we can also conclude that this particular teacher was stuck with using only transmission-mode teaching-learning methods. In this regard,  So  and  Kim  (2009)  contended  that,  although  some teachers had basic knowledge about PBL, the knowledge was not sufficient to introduce PBL as they were not able to manage learning experiences in a correct way.

The post-questionnaires showed that 59 of the 62 teachers (95.1%) who completed the questionnaire gave an indication that they had a better understanding of PBL after the SLP and that they  would  also  use  it  in  their  lessons.  One  of  the  teachers commented,  'I have learned that problems  from learners' environments will enhance learning' (cited in De Villiers 2018:145). Another teacher stated that 'problem-based learning makes the learners think and work instead of the old method of teaching of just  writing  on  the  board.  I  want  to  use  it' (cited in De Villiers 2018:263). Another teacher gave an example of how PBL may be

used in a Life Sciences learning experience, saying '[g]ive them a problem, for example global warming, and expect them to come up with a solution based on the given problem' (cited in De Villiers 2018:243).  Based  on  the  comments  of  some  teachers,  we  can also  conclude  that  they  understood  the  teachers'  role  as  a facilitator during a PBL lesson, for example, when they said 'PBL looks  at  real-life  problems,  the  teacher  facilitates  learning  and expecting the learners to actually be problem-solvers' (cited in De Villiers 2018:125).

From the findings of this study - with comments such as 'I'm definitely going to apply it [PBL] in my class' (cited in De Villiers 2018:262) and 'A more learner-centred approach, as a facilitator you also learn from learners' (cited in De Villiers 2018:145) - it was clear that the intervention had positively influenced the participating teachers' knowledge and PCK with regard to the implementation of PBL. However, the observations made during the class visits in Polokwane (Limpopo) revealed that although teachers gained from attending the intervention, they failed to use it in their classes. The teachers observed mentioned a number of reasons that will be elaborated on later in this chapter.

It is necessary to provide additional support to these teachers in the implementation of PBL and IK to ensure the facilitation of border-crossing between the tenets of science and IK.

In Chapter 2, Mentz and De Beer focus on data regarding PBL after the Calvinia intervention. Sufficient evidence was provided that PBL was better achieved during this intervention.

## Findings with regard to the nature of indigenous knowledge and the nature of science

At the onset of the intervention, participating teachers had limited knowledge of the NOS and NOIK, but after the intervention there was an improvement in their knowledge about IK and the NOS and their attitude towards infusing IK into the science curriculum.

Literature showed that teachers usually do not have a nuanced understanding of the NOS. At the beginning of the SLP, most of the participating science teachers strengthened this finding by referring  to  the  NOS  as,  'scientific  method  using  empirical methods of investigation' and 'result-oriented; process of discovering; practical investigations'. The comments made by the participants do  not  recognise  the  creative, subjective and culturally embedded tenets of the NOS. Reddy et al. (2018) argue that if teachers do not have a nuanced understanding of the NOS, the NOIK will also be unclear, leading in turn to an inability of science teachers to integrate IK in the science content.

In a master's  study  conducted  by  De  Villiers  (2018),  a postgraduate student in this funded IK project, the data of the VNOIK pre- and post-questionnaires were used to categorise the participating  science  teachers'  ( N =  83)  knowledge  of  IK  as uninformed, partially informed or informed. The study reported that 12% of teachers were uninformed, 86.67% partially informed and  only  1.33%  had  knowledge  about  IK.  Comments  from  the teachers during the interviews and on the questionnaire include 'I didn't have this knowledge on IK. I didn't even think about it' (cited in De Villiers 2018:154). Another teacher commented that 'I just stick to the curriculum. I just teach theory from text books' (cited  in  De  Villiers  2018:324).  Reddy  (2019),  prior  to  the  SLP, reported  that  87%  of  teachers  were  uninformed  about  IK  and afterwards almost the same percentage indicated that they had an informed view.

Some teachers had misconceptions about IK and, therefore, did not care to infuse IK into the curriculum; '[a]t the beginning I had  a misconception  that indigenous knowledge  means witchcraft  and muthi' (cited  in  De  Villiers  2018:324).  Another participant from the Lenasia also alluded to a misconception that IK only refers to African IK (cited in De Villiers 2018):

So when I saw that there is Indian  and  Dutch  etc.  IK,  I  thought this is interesting; I was living in my own world. I thought it was only the Zulu traditional medicine that exists. So yes, it opened my mind. (p. 324)

Twenty per cent of the participants who attended the Lenasia SLP ( N = 15) said that there was no way to verify IK. This of course also indicates a misconception because the healing effects of traditionally used plants can be tested in a laboratory as is done with the KirbyBauer process during the SLP. In another example, presented as a PBL approach, the participating teachers were presented with two problems about the role of ethylene in seed germination and the role of ethylene in the post-harvest physiology of cut flowers (flower senescence).  The  investigation  about  germination  of  seeds  was contextualised by the Chinese practice of burning incense to release ethylene to enhance the ripening of fruit (De Beer &amp; Petersen 2017a). The other investigation pertained to prolonging the shelf life of cut flowers.  This  can  be  linked  to,  firstly,  Dutch  IK  and  also  local  IK according to which coke, sugar, bleach, etc. can be used to prolong the  shelf  life  of  flowers  (De  Beer  &amp;  Petersen  2017b).  Both  these problems  can  be  investigated  in  the  laboratory,  facilitating  the border-crossing between the NOS and the NOIK. Another comment indicated that although some teachers realised the value of infusing IK into the curriculum, they did not have sufficient PCK to do so, stating that 'although I see the value of IK, I do not know how to bring it alive in my classroom' (cited in De Villiers 2018:324). Even though the participating science teachers who attended the SLP in Lenasia were well qualified to teach Life Sciences, most of them did not integrate IK or use it to contextualise the science content. One teacher indicated that the topics of the nervous system, gaseous exchange and photosynthesis were not suitable to infuse IK into the lesson (Reddy et al. 2018). This comment is a clear indication of this teacher's insufficient PCK with regard to IK because human diseases, as part of human physiology, can easily be linked to local practices in treating diseases.

## Findings with regard to the nature of indigenous knowledge

In most of the interventions listed in Table 6.2, we had pre-VNOIK questionnaires for all participants, but unfortunately only some of the teachers submitted the post-VNOIK instruments with their

portfolios after the SLP. For this reason, it is statistically more meaningful to show the overall picture (for all the interventions), comparing respondents' (for which we have both questionnaires) performance in the pre- and post-VNOIK instrument. Our data support the findings of Cronje (2015) and De Beer and Mentz (2016), who have shown that the SLP in general has a positive influence  on  teachers'  learning  and  that,  in  the  post-VNOIK questionnaire, teachers generally express more nuanced views of IK, as can be seen in Table 6.3.

One of the questions during the interview to the participating teachers was: After completing this SLP, will you integrate IK into your teaching? Some of the answers of the respondents were '[d] efinitely.  I've  learned  how  to  use  the  things  that  I  have  to  teach learners  about  indigenous  knowledge'  (cited  from  De  Villiers 2018:326)  and  'I  think  it's  part  of  us  and  it's  very  important  [...] Indigenous knowledge to me is the same as science. Why don't we teach it in school?' (cited in De Villiers 2018:154). These reactions of the participating science teachers give an indication of their attitudes towards infusing IK change positively. The remarks made by two of the teachers also attest to the fact that their knowledge about IK and how to infuse it into the curriculum had improved, stating that 'the  fermentation  process,  making  beer  and  the  preservation  of food,  those  methods  can  be  linked  to  the  curriculum'  (cited  in De Villiers 2018:326), and 'an activity can be designed where learners do research on how elders would heal infections' (cited in De Villiers 2018:326). The data collected during the Lenasia intervention further supported the finding that the SLP contributed to improving the participating science teachers' PCK with regard to IK.

## Challenges in using engaging pedagogies and indigenous knowledge in science education

In spite of the overwhelming positive responses, experiences and improved PCK of the participating science teachers in the SLP, most  of  those  observed  could  not  transfer  the  newly  learnt knowledge and skills into actual practice. So why did transfer not take place in the classroom? Why is it that teachers struggled to design teaching-learning experiences where the science content can be better contextualised in order for learners to identify with the content taught? This is necessary for learners to, firstly, learn on a social plane with others and, secondly, to internalise it on a personal plane in the ZPD.

Lortie  (1975)  gives  one  reason  for  why  teachers  do  not change their practices, in what he calls the 'apprenticeship of observation',  which  he  explains  as  the  practice  whereby teachers  base  their  own  practices  on  knowledge  gained  by observation, imitating their own teachers while they were in school.  The  reality  in  most  South  African  science  classes  is therefore the continuation of using predominantly transmissionmode teaching-learning methods.

Zeichner and Tabachnick (1981:7) provide another reason for this phenomenon, where teachers failing to apply what they learnt at  university  (or  after  SLPs)  can  be  explained  by  the  'wash-out effect'.  This  happens  when  skills  and  knowledge  learnt  during teacher  development  courses  'are  often  'washed  out'  at  the coalface of teaching in the classroom' (De Beer &amp; Mentz 2018:7). In Chapter 3, De Beer and Mentz refer to teachers' inclination to use transmission-mode  approaches  and  'teaching-to-the-test'.  The same  authors  argue  that  teachers  are  caught  up  between  the demands of the university and schools. The demands of schools refers to the systemic pressures or rules regarding covering the curriculum  at  all  costs,  following  pace-setters  in  time,  and  the examination-driven system forcing teachers to teach to the test.

## Findings through the CulturalHistorical Activity Theory lens

The  data  indicate  that  the  SLP  did  improve  the  participating science teachers' PCK with regard to using engaging pedagogies, such as CL and PBL, and IK to contextualise the science content in order to facilitate border-crossing between NOS and NOIK. The findings reported in this chapter are also supported by a number of  other  studies  in  this  funded  project  (De  Villiers,  De  Beer  &amp; Golightly  2016;  De  Beer  &amp;  Mentz  2018;  De  Villiers  et  al.  2018; Jacobs,  De  Beer  &amp;  Petersen  2016;  Reddy,  De  Beer  &amp;  Petersen 2016, 2017; Reddy et al. 2018; White &amp; De Beer 2017). In Figure 6.4, the left activity system represents the science teachers' (subject) professional development with the SLP. While reaching the object during  the  SLP,  teachers  were  trained  to  act  as  facilitators  of

learning  and  to  be  reflective  practitioners  (division  of  labour). One of the design principles of the second and third cycles of the DBR was to expose participating science teachers to the use of CAR in order for them to improve their teaching-learning practices. Guided by the rules in the activity system, namely, all the tenets of NOS and NOIK (see Table 6.1), and in spite of the examinationdriven education system, teachers used the engaging pedagogies in such a way as to infuse IK into the science content during the SLP. This empowers teachers with a nuanced understanding of the tenets of the NOS and NOIK, to facilitate the border-crossing between the NOS and NOIK. The newly learnt knowledge and skills  enable  participating  science  teachers  to  design  contextualised teaching-learning  experiences  for  their  learners,  in  line  with Gibbons' (2000) Mode 2 knowledge production.

The  juxtaposed  activity  system,  on  the  right-hand  side  of Figure 6.4, represents the activity system of the same science teachers  who  attended  the  SLP  in  their  classes  after  the intervention. The data collected during the observation and the artefacts studied indicated that most of the teachers observed, in spite of their positive experience of the SLP, failed to introduce engaging pedagogies in their classes to infuse IK into the science content.  We  can  therefore  argue  that  although  the  bordercrossing between NOS and NOIK did take place in an academic or a cognitive way, it did not take place in practice. We can further argue that there exists a tension between the objectives of the two activity systems. The object in sub-activity system A  (Figure  6.4)  favours  having  teachers  design  contextualised science lessons using IK and engaging pedagogies to facilitate a border-crossing between NOS and NOIK. On the other hand, the object in sub-activity system B shows teachers going back to the olden  ways  of  using  predominantly  teacher-centred  methods, also referred to as 'chalk-and-talk', when covering the curriculum

content (refer to the research of Ramnarain and Schuster 2014). If the  teachers  do  practical  work,  most  follow  the  scientific method in a superficial way, not attending to all the tenets of the NOS and NOIK (Table 6.1). Most participating science teachers follow  these  methods  in  spite  of  the  CAPS  document,  which requires teachers to use IK when teaching science content. The reason  for  these  practices  of  teachers  is  the  exam-driven education system, which expects teachers to follow the pacesetters to cover the curriculum in time. Zeichner and Tabachnick (1981:7)  argued  that  the  teachers  are  'caught  between  the conflicting  demands  exerted  by  the  schools  and  universities' (read also professional development SLPs).

## Recommendations

Science  education  should  deliver  learners  who  experience  the relevance of science in their everyday lives and who have a good understanding  of  the  NOS  in  order  to  be  scientifically  literate individuals. Such  individuals  will  be  in  a  better  position  to participate  effectively  in  the  21st  century  society  and  make informed choices in their day-to-day lives. In order to foster such learners, we need competent science teachers possessing good PCK. The SLPs presented to science teachers, as described in this chapter, aimed at contributing to science teachers' PCK in order for them to be agents of change in their schools and classrooms. The  findings  of  this  research  indicate  that  the  SLPs  were  only partially  successful  in  so  far  as  they  did  add  value  to  the  participating science teachers' knowledge and skills with regard to engaging pedagogies and infusing IK into the curriculum, but were not so successful in terms of transfer of knowledge and skills of most of the teachers observed, which did not take place. Although design principles of previous SLPs were identified and incorporated into subsequent SLPs, it is still necessary to identify additional design principles  that  could  further  inform  and  adapt  future  SLPs. Improving  SLPs,  notwithstanding  the  systemic  pressures  that teachers experience, might contribute to science teachers' ability to apply the newly learnt skills in their classrooms. One such design

principle in this DBR can be to customise a specific SLP to cater to  the  specific  needs  of  the  particular  participating  teachers. A thorough needs analysis of the prospective participants should be performed to inform the adaptation of the contents of the SLP. One shortfall of the intervention described in this chapter is that, post-intervention,  the  participant  teachers  did  not  always  have access  to  the  researchers.  This  was  because  of  not  only  time constraints experienced by researchers but also a lack of assisting the CoP established during the SLP. The CoP established during the SLP should function more effectively in a sustainable manner. In order to enhance the effectiveness of the CoP, a few teachers attending the SLP should be identified by the researchers to take a  leading  role  in  the  CoP.  Such  leading  teachers  should  be passionate about science teaching, possess good PCK, have an aptitude to work with people and social media, and be agents of change in spite of systemic pressures. Wenger (2006) refers to such leading teachers as the keystone species, absolutely necessary to the effective and continuous functioning of a CoP.

At the beginning of this chapter, we referred to Vision 2030 envisioning the eradication of poverty and the need to make education more accessible to the marginalised. We believe that the work done with science teachers as reported in this chapter does  contribute  to  the  activation  of  Vision  2030  by  adding value  to  the  professional  development  of  science  teachers, empowering  them  to  use  engaging  pedagogies  to  design contextualised science teaching-learning experiences accessible to most South African learners.

## Summary

Science education in South Africa is characterised by predominantly teacher-centred teaching and learning approaches where  the  subject  content  is  usually  not  well  contextualised. Where practical work is done, it is characterised by the steps of the  scientific method,  emphasising  the  empirical  NOS,  but marginalising tenets such as the creative NOS. This practice leads to learners not having a nuanced understanding of the tenets of

the NOS. This chapter reports on research on the affordances of IK not only as a vehicle to contextualise the science content but also to facilitate border-crossing between the tenets of the NOS and the NOIK. In this regard, Gibbons (2000) refers to contextsensitive  science  as  Mode  2  knowledge  production  to  address the usually neglected affective domain in science teaching. Both the  NOS  and  the  nature  of  IK  include  socially  and  culturally constructed tenets of an empirical, inferential, tentative, subjective and creative nature. The research question addressed in  this  qualitative  study  was:  How  can  engaging  pedagogies facilitate the epistemological  border-crossing  between  (the tenets of) science and IK? The authors define engaging pedagogies as any inductive teaching-learning strategy such as PBL, CL or contextualised learning, where the learners or students are  actively  involved  in  the  learning  process  while  developing 21st century skills. Learning methods purposefully focus on the development of affective outcomes. Third-generation CHAT was used as an analytical lens to get a theoretical grasp of the research data  collected  on  a  SLP  for  science  teachers  and  to  identify tensions in the activity system. Teachers do not have nuanced understandings of the NOS and the NOIK and are therefore not in a position to design appropriate teaching-learning experiences for  their  learners  to  understand  these  concepts.  This  chapter reports on the findings based on the data collected during the SLPs presented to science teachers where they were exposed to ways of integrating the tenets of the NOS, IK, PBL and CL. The data  indicated  that  IK,  through  engaging  pedagogies,  can  be used to facilitate the border-crossing between science and IK.

## Introduction

In a  rapidly  changing  world,  and  a  complex  21st  century, teachers'  teaching-learning  activities  need  to  adapt  to  the changing  needs  posed  by  a  globalised  world,  which  means learners need to be equipped with workplace skills for future jobs that could be demanding (Davidson 2012; Portilho &amp; Medina 2016; Smith &amp; Morgan 2016). Traditional Mathematics teachers' transmission-mode teaching-learning of the Westernised (abstract, decontextualised) curriculum needs to be reconsidered, as it seems to fail to develop in learners the ability to reason mathematically (Boaler 2015). Furthermore, achievement and interest in Mathematics among South African learners are low. Mathematics is widely despised and regarded as a boring subject accompanied by an aversion for Mathematics (negative emotions). Mathematics, therefore, becomes a subject that involves 'a set of procedures to be followed' by learners, parents and some teachers, creating a negative attitude towards it (Brodie  2016a).  There  are  but  a  few  teachers  who  have not  heard  learners  say  'why  do  I  have  to  learn  Mathematics? I'm never going to use it!'

Against this backdrop, current trends in Mathematics Education research focus on the investigation of mathematical ideas and practices  (contexts)  that  occur  outside  the  school  classroom (Rosa &amp; Orey 2013). The infusing of IKS serves as a methodology to fuse Mathematics and culture together. Research shows that learners have cultural knowledge and experiences that support them in their learning endeavours (Furuto 2014). When compared with Western Mathematics, teaching with IK brings about several differences  in  the  learning  experience.  The  first  difference  lies within the way knowledge is transmitted. Indigenous knowledge is transmitted orally, while Western Mathematics is mainly written. Also,  IK  is  based  on  real-life  observations  and  experiences, evaluated in the light of what one has learnt from elders, whereas Western Mathematics is taught and learnt often (not always) in an abstract context (Anonymous n.d.).

Teaching Mathematics only in a Western context ignores the value learners experience from the subject, as it overlooks the link  between  content,  curricula  and  real  life,  and  diminishes meaningful learning of Mathematics. As Mathematics belongs to all cultures, stemming from different needs, the goal remains the  same:  to  develop  and  empower  (Ndlovu  2018;  Salami  &amp; Okeke 2017).

## Problem statement

South Africa is situated within a multifaceted ethnic, racial and cultural setting. The rich cultural IKS that can be referred to as 'knowledge in the blood' includes views, values and attitudes related to cultural practices (Webb 2011). Although South African education has experienced many curriculum reforms since 1994, the quality of teaching and transformation has not yet improved as envisaged (Tsotetsi &amp; Mahlomaholo 2015). The National CAPS of South Africa clearly states that IKS should be acknowledged with  regard  to  the  rich  history  and  heritage  it  encompasses (DBE 2011).

While the value of IK in education has been well recognised, this recognition has not yet been translated into implementation of the school Mathematics curriculum (Luitel 2013), especially in South Africa. In the Mathematics classroom, the teacher should make use of and incorporate learners' own ideas linked to their IK and culture, which should be linked to Mathematics (Baturo, Norton &amp; Cooper 2004). In addition, the lack of nuanced PCK among some teachers and the limited quality teacher professional development  in  South  Africa,  particularly  regarding  IK,  are  a cause for concern (CDE 2011). Teachers who are unprepared or underprepared for teaching-learning practices, or those who are ignorant  of  the  views,  cultural  practices,  beliefs,  values  and attitudes possessed by our learners, will not be able to meet this demand.  Consequently,  if  they  do  not  apply  contextualised Mathematics  because  of  the  lack  of  adequate  training  and implementation, both content and pedagogy would suffer.

## Research question

The research question that guided this research is: What are the affordances  of  IKS  for  a  teacher  professional  development intervention in which Mathematics topics are contextualised in indigenous games, music and puppetry using the PoP (and using metacognition as reflective methodology)?

## Theoretical framework

As a cultural lens through which Mathematics can be viewed in order to enrich the teaching and learning experience for learners in the classroom, indigenous games, like Morabaraba and Ncuva , can form an integral part of ethnomathematics and provide an opportunity to contextualise Mathematics topics in IK (Nkopodi &amp; Mosimege 2009). As soon as the nature of learning is influenced by  the  environment  in  which  it  takes  place,  contextualisation occurs (Brown 2008).

Horsthemke  and  Schäfer  (2007)  are  not  convinced  that ethnomathematics facilitates access to 'real' Mathematics in the South African context - it is  only  meaningful  in  a  very  narrow localised  context.  They  question  the  challenge  to  locate  and identify  scientific  skills,  knowledge  and  processes  embedded  in cultural  practices  in  order  to  simply  redesign  and  reformulate present  curricula.  However,  these  authors  admit  that  current research  is  too  scant  to  show  that  the  general  concept  (of contextualising  Mathematics  in  IK)  actually  works.  A  weakness with their argument, however, is that the teacher who acts as the 'agent of change' in the classroom is responsible to bridge the gap between mathematical content and enculturated (contextualised and mathematised) content in such a way that learning becomes meaningful for learners in the Mathematics classroom. The most recent research to date has tended to focus on ethnomathematics as a 'gateway' for inclusion. An advantage of ethnomathematics for teachers and learners is that it leads to social interaction and collaboration.  Social  interaction  regulated  by  the  teacher  when

implementing ethnomathematics approaches is important because it leads to a better understanding of each other's culture and real-life experiences (Zevenbergen et al. 2010).

Therefore,  the  theoretical  framework  that  provided  the foundation of this research is social constructivism as conceptualised by Vygotsky (1989). Social constructivism (which stems from constructivism) emphasises cognitive growth in teaching-learning endeavours, which allowed participants in the intervention to socially collaborate - in this case, the PoP - to explore indigenous games, music and the use of puppetry  to  enhance  teaching-learning  in  Mathematics (Amineh  &amp;  Asl  2015).  Social  constructivism  allowed  us  to describe the affordances of contextualising Mathematics in IK according  to  participants'  perceptions  and  experiences  with PoP and indigenous games.

## Conceptual framework

The need for literature in a South African professional teacher development context suggests that teachers should be introduced to Mathematics topics or themes contextualised in IK or learners' everyday lives. The elements in Figure 7.1 will subsequently be discussed under the conceptual framework of this study.

## Metacognition as reflective methodology

Flavell (1979) defined metacognition as metacognitive knowledge and self-regulation. In order to be responsible for one's own lifelong learning or professional development, one needs  to be consciously aware  of one's thinking when orchestrating  one's  own  teaching-learning  by  taking  action when teaching and/or learning. The tendency to think about a teaching  task  (producing  a  metacognitive  conceptualisation of  the  task)  and  to  use  metacognitive  knowledge  and  selfregulation is called reflection (Cornoldi 2010; Ertmer &amp; Newby 1996).

PCK, pedagogical content knowledge.

Metacognition  as  reflective  methodology  was  used  in  this research to enhance and deepen teachers' learning experiences during and after the SLP and to support them in transferring their new PCK (PoP) and knowledge about contextualised Mathematics to their classrooms. Reflection emerges as a way of supporting teachers' improved understanding of what they know and do, as they develop their knowledge of teaching through reconsidering what and how they teach (and how their learners learn). Reflection develops understanding about the way teachers conduct their work  and  focuses  on  their  understanding  of  the  (teachinglearning)  task,  strategies  and  about  themselves,  constructing connections between prior and new knowledge about teachinglearning practices or activities.

## Metacognitive knowledge of cognition

One becomes aware of one's current state of accomplishment along with the situational influences and strategic choices that are currently influencing or which have previously influenced the accomplishment  of  that  process  through  reflection  (Scharff 2015). Reflection on metacognitive knowledge precedes, accompanies and follows cognitive strategies (Livingston 2003);

teaching-learning content (subject matter), on the one hand, and metacognitive knowledge (person, task and strategy variables) and  self-regulation  (planning,  monitoring  and  evaluation)  on the other.

Reflection  is  seen  as  the  intentional,  ongoing  interaction between  metacognitive  knowledge  and  self-regulation  of  the development  of  teaching-learning  processes.  Metacognition  through reflection for (before), in (during) and on (after) teaching and/or  learning  -  is  the  medium  through  which  we  teach  and learn by planning, monitoring (guiding) and evaluating teaching and learning (Cornoldi 2010). Such reflection is the link between metacognitive knowledge used to oversee and regulate teachinglearning and understanding through predicting outcomes, planning activities, monitoring activities and checking outcomes of the activities, ensuring that the cognitive goal has been met. When in need of appropriate teaching-learning strategies,  the teacher must think about similar experiences or problems and reflect critically on these to differentiate between the available and appropriate approaches.

## Self-regulation (or regulation of cognition)

Actions  that  arise from  intentional  thinking  are deliberate, informed and goal-directed and refer to control processes such as self-regulation of one's thought process.

Metacognitive awareness refers to the conscious awareness in planning, control or monitoring, and evaluation of one's own cognitive processes (Sternberg &amp; Sternberg 2012:234). Teachers who are metacognitively aware of their Mathematical Knowledge  for  Teaching  (MKT)  are  able  to  predict  or  even avoid  misconceptions  and  errors;  are  more  rigorous  in  their explanations of school Mathematics, deepening learners' knowledge on topics; provide environments for a rich discussion pertaining to the curriculum content; and are able to implement and critically reflect on the curriculum so as to select the best resources  to  assist  in  the  contextualisation  of  lessons  (Ball, Thames &amp; Phelps 2008).

Furthermore, self-regulation is an active part of planning and prediction,  monitoring  and  evaluation  (Bransford,  Brophy  &amp; Williams 2000; Dunlosky &amp; Metcalfe 2009).

Planning refers  to  how  a  teaching-learning  task  is  approached, thinking  about  the  teaching  objective  and  available  time, selecting and using appropriate skills and strategies to teach the  topic,  self-assessing  which  type  of  task  is  at  hand,  goal setting,  responding  to  what  the  task  requires  and  what  one wants to achieve, who is acting and how one would approach the task.

Prediction skills include the selection of appropriate strategies  and  allocation  of  resources  (Desoete  2008).  This skill enables a teacher to predict the difficulty of the (teaching and/or learning) task and to use that prediction to regulate the engagement related to the outcome. According to Savin Baden and Wilkie (2004), teachers must diagnose their own and their learners' learning needs and identify resources for teaching-learning.

Monitoring refers to one's continued awareness of comprehension and task performance through monitoring one's own and others' (e.g. learners') comprehension of text, progress towards  completing  the  task  or  solving  the  problem,  selfassessing and  self-correcting responses  to  self-assessment, understanding personal achievement through continuous monitoring of the progress one has made towards the cognitive goal and becoming more aware of distracting stimuli (Dunlosky &amp; Metcalfe 2009).

Evaluating the  results  of  one's  teaching-learning efforts (i.e. approaches and strategies used to complete the task) improves one's  awareness  of  effective  teaching-learning  strategies  and skills and provides ways to use these strategies in other teachinglearning  situations.  Evaluation  skills  appraise  the  product  or outcome  and  regulatory  processes  of  the  teaching-learning experience (Lucangeli, Cornoldi &amp; Tellarini 1998).

## Pedagogical content knowledge

Pedagogical Content Knowledge refers to the complex nature of a teacher's knowledge of the content (Mathematics), the learners (how  they  learn  and  understand)  and  teaching  (available  and appropriate teaching strategies and techniques). This term was coined by Lee Shulman (1987), who emphasised PCK as a subjectspecific concept. Ball et al. (2008) developed a subject-specific model  for  school  Mathematics  based  on  Shulman's  model  for PCK.  Ball  et  al. (2008)  introduced  the  model  called  MKT. Mathematical  Knowledge  for  Teaching  (Ball  et  al.  2008)  is  a framework  for  the  effective  teaching-learning  of  Mathematics and can be illustrated as seen in Figure 7.2.

In the MKT model, Ball et al. (2008) differentiate between two interrelated domains, namely, SMK and PCK. These two domains

can be distinguished but cannot be separated. Subject matter knowledge includes:

- 1. common content knowledge
- 2.  knowledge at the mathematical horizon
- 3.  specialised content knowledge.

For  this  research,  we  are  not  elaborating  on  SMK  but  are rather focussing on the following three elements pertaining to PCK:

- 1. Knowledge  of  the  content  and  learners  (how  they  learn) that binds knowledge about learners with knowledge about Mathematics (Petrou &amp; Goulding 2011)
- 2.  Knowledge  of  content  and  teaching  that  empowers  the teacher  to  foresee  difficulties  and  misunderstandings  that learners may have and to make informed decisions regarding (available  and/or  appropriate)  teaching-learning  strategies (Petrou &amp; Goulding 2011)
- 3.  Knowledge  of  the  curriculum  -  adherence  to  the  CAPS curriculum as well as pace-setters to teach the topics in the allocated time frames for every grade (DoE 2011).

## Pedagogies of play in Mathematics

Vygotsky (1978) believed that PoP is much needed in classrooms. According  to  him,  play  is  meaningful  because  it  creates  new learning experiences in order to attain new knowledge. Neuroscientists have discovered recently that up to 400 repetitions  are  required  by  the  brain  to  develop  a  synapse; however, if repetition is part of play, the number of repetitions for the synapse to develop decreases to about 10-20 (Brown 2009). (Also, refer to the insights in Ch. 4.) Teachers are hesitant to use PoP  in  the  classroom,  although  learners  are  very  receptive  to such an approach (Brits, De Beer &amp; Mabotja 2016; Remer &amp; Tzuriel 2015), and learners have no fear of the content because learning occurs in a playful manner.

Currently, the connection between learning and play is being researched worldwide. However, there is a paucity in the literature regarding research on the use of indigenous African games as a potential  (Mathematics)  learning  space  (Nkopodi  &amp;  Mosimege 2009). Using the IK embedded in games, music, art or puppetry are but a few examples of potential learning spaces in contextualising Mathematics.

Indigenous games are embedded in cultural practices and are passed down from generation to generation along with views, beliefs, values and attitudes of this specific culture (Bayeck 2018). Games engage learners on a positive level where their attitudes can  be  improved  -  they  provide  enjoyment,  increase  learners' cognitive abilities in Mathematics and play an important role in the  development  of  their  social  and  non-cognitive  skills  (e.g. patience  and  discipline).  Worldwide,  games  are  regarded  as learning spaces to improve learning (Bayeck 2018).

According to Mosimege and Ismael (2004), the potentialities of non-Western games have not been explored sufficiently. They (Mosimege and Ismael) note that indigenous games should be considered in their entire context (historical, social and cultural), which  is  possible  to  find  and  use  appropriately.  Resources  for teaching  can  benefit  from  own  local  and  cultural  resources. Morabaraba (Sesotho) or Umfabafaba (isiXhosa), as it is known in South  Africa,  belongs  to  the  class  of  'three-in-a-row'  board games.  Mosimege  and  Ismael  (2004)  identified  mathematical concepts  by  analysing  a Morabaraba board's  various  quadrilaterals, ratio  and  proportion  between  the  lines,  and  symmetry. Morabaraba and Ncuva are well known to many South African teachers and learners, and these games support various Mathematics topics and themes (Nkopodi &amp; Mosimege 2009).

## Contextualising Mathematics

Mazzeo  (2008)  defines  contextualised  teaching  as  'a  diverse group  of  teaching  strategies'  to  make  the  learning  of  (Mathematics)

skills,  content  and  language  accessible  by  focussing  teaching and  learning  on  concrete  applications  in  a  specific  (familiar) context. The authors argued that contextualised Mathematics could serve as a good entry point into the abstract world of Mathematics. Contextualised Mathematics provides the opportunity to give all South African learners epistemological access to good education and  provides  learning  affordances  in  Mathematics  (DoE  2011). Contextualising  Mathematics  topics  in  IK  (games,  music  and puppetry) via a PoP teacher professional development SLP might result in more meaningful (Mathematics) teaching-learning and more affective engagement of learners in Mathematics learning or activities (De Beer &amp; Kriek 2018). It is important to note that incorporating a sociocultural (contextualised) component in the curriculum acknowledges the importance of the affective dimensions  in  Mathematics  teaching  (Gavarrete  2015).  When designing Mathematics lessons, mathematical ideas are deliberately embedded in IK to provide a sense of purpose and relevance for learning Mathematics in terms of the development of Western mathematical understanding (Ainley, Pratt &amp; Hansel 2006).

## Mathematising Mathematics

Mathematisation is the reverse process in which real contextual problems  are  expressed  mathematically  (abstract  Westernised Mathematics semiotics), making Mathematics the vehicle for  solving  real  problems,  and  it  shows  how  Mathematics  is used  (Fosnot  &amp;  Dolk  2001).  Mathematics  teachers  bridge  the Westernised  curriculum  content  by  contextualising  and  then mathematising it, making Mathematics understandable, relevant and meaningful.

## Indigenous knowledge systems

There  is  no  standard  definition  for  IK;  however,  in  general,  it can be defined as the local knowledge that is unique to a given

culture or society (Izmirli 2011). Regardless of the definition of IK, there  is  a  consensus  that  various  communities,  cultures  and societies have IK systems that evolve and change as they develop, influenced by interactions with other knowledge systems (Izmirli 2011).

When  comparing  IK  and  Western  Mathematics,  the  first difference  lies  within  the  way  they  are  transmitted;  IK  is transmitted  orally, while  Western  Mathematics  is  mainly written.  Secondly,  IK  is  based  on  real-life  observations  and experiences,  evaluated  in  the  light  of  what  one  has  learnt from elders or through experience, while Western science is taught and learnt often (not always) in an abstract context (Anonymous n.d.).

According  to  Brodie  (2016a,  2016b)  and  the  Council  on Higher Education (CHE) (2017), decolonisation of the Mathematics  curriculum  is  concerned  not  only  with  what  is being taught to South African learners but also how it is taught and  how  teachers  orientate  themselves  in  their  teachinglearning praxis. Decolonisation of the Mathematics curriculum presents  an  opportunity  to  contextualise  Mathematics  in  IK and then mathematising it in the Western abstract way so as to give all learners access to a Westernised curriculum and enrich their  overall  learning  and  their  sense  of  applicability  of  the subject (Brodie 2016a; Salami &amp; Okeke 2017; Venkat, Bomie &amp; Graven 2009).

As soon as Mathematics is packaged according to a specific context  (contextualised  through  the  infusion  of  indigenous games), the real mathematical ideas behind the topic under study are brought forth (Thornton, Statton &amp; Mountzouris 2012). Such contextualising enables learners to mathematise their reality and understand school Mathematics based on the way the teacher contextualises the content (Fosnot &amp; Dolk 2001). 'Colonisation' of the curriculum  occurred  when  norms,  practices,  codes, meanings  and  values  were  'hidden'  from  learners,  leading  to unawareness of the 'ways of knowing, thinking and understandings'

that were indigenous to them and their culture (CHE 2017). This can  be  addressed  by  contextualising  Mathematics  topics  and themes in IK.

## Ethnomathematics

According to D'Ambrosio (2006), cultural contexts in Mathematics  Education  strongly  advocate  more  meaningful, relevant and accessible Mathematics to learners. The incorporation of culture by means of IK practices (e.g. indigenous games) situates knowledge that already exists and can foster optimal  learning  experiences  in  the  Mathematics  classroom. D'Ambrosio (1984) and Mosimege (2018) explain ethnomathematics as mathematical practices by various cultural groups. This can be done using certain cultural symbols, codes, languages, values or attitudes in order for learners to access the theoretical grounding of the body of knowledge of Mathematics, whereby they identify with it, understand it and apply  it.  According  to  Fossa  (2006)  and  Tutak,  Bondy  and Adams (2011), ethnomathematics refers to the different ways in which learners in cultural groups practise Mathematics and how they  incorporate  this  authentic  Mathematics,  influenced  by their culture and daily lives, in the reconstruction of Mathematics (mathematising) in the classroom. It can therefore be said that ethnomathematics enables learners to establish a connection between Western (abstract) mathematical semiotics, the representation  thereof,  as  well  as  the  imagery  they  establish derived from their culture, in order to understand the mathematical concept being taught.

## A short learning programme in ethnomathematics as intervention

The  SLP  in  ethnomathematics  was  designed  to  introduce Mathematics themes and topics that are contextualised in IK using a PoP. The SLP introduced teachers to various concepts

and  examples,  including  metacognition  (more  specifically reflection); contextualised Mathematics, using a PoP; CL - De Bono's Thinking Hats; and lesson study. Games ( Morabaraba and Ncuva ), music (boomwhackers) and puppetry were also used as a PoP, because it created a 'doorway' for authentic problem-solving, which relates to learners' real-life experiences  (Keogh  et  al.  2008).  The  next  three  sections provide  a  brief  summary  of  how  we  integrated  the  games, music and puppetry.

## Games

Games require people to actively engage their thinking (cognition),  their  bodies  (physically)  and  their  feelings  (about understanding  Mathematics)  (Corti  2006).  Various  researchers (Ferguson 2014; Inamdar and Kulkarni 2007; and Mustafa, Khan and Ullah 2011) found in their studies that learners in Mathematics classrooms  benefitted  (performance  and  attitude-wise)  from playing interactive games. Indigenous games, such as Morabaraba and Ncuva , can be repurposed for achieving a learning goal such as  the  conceptual  understanding  of  2D  geometrical  figures  or fractions (Naik 2015).

## The game of Morabaraba and 2D geometrical figures

Morabaraba (Figure  7.3) involves  two  players  and  involves strategic thinking. When the game commences, each player has 12 'cows' (tokens) that are placed strategically and alternatively on a Morabaraba board at intersections of straight lines. The aim is to  put  three  tokens  in  a  row:  vertically,  horizontally  and diagonally  on  open  intersections.  When  a  player  gets  three tokens in a row, he or she may remove a token of the opponent, not breaking a three-in-a-row placement of the opponent. The removed tokens may not be placed back on the board again. When  all  tokens  are  placed  on  the  board,  the  second  phase

commences where players can move a token to an open adjacent intersection.  During  the  third  phase,  the  last  level  commences when at least one of the players has only three tokens left. These three tokens may 'fly' to any intersection on the board with each turn of the player. There are more rules for more advanced players available on the website (as listed above the list of references). The game is over when one player has only two tokens left on the board or when one player cannot move any of his or her tokens. The game ends in a draw when one player has three tokens but is unable to remove one of the opponent's tokens within 10 moves. The winner is the opponent who could remove all but two tokens of the opponent.

In this research, puzzles of 2D geometric figures available on the game board were cut to introduce the different figures and to build other figures with two or more puzzle pieces, grid paper to allow for teaching perimeter and area with puzzle pieces, as well as appropriate mathematics vocabulary.

## The game of Ncuva and case-based teaching

Ncuva (also known as Moruba ) is a strategic board game involving problem-solving skills. The aim of the game is to play until one's opponent has lost all of his or her 'cows' (pebbles). The 'cows' are small pebbles, pips or seeds that are used as tokens in the game.

Small holes are dug in the ground or the game can be played on an official board or a piece of paper (using circles, not holes). Two 'cows' are placed in each hole. The aim of the game is to capture as many of the opponent's 'cows' as possible. This twoplayer game is separated by a 'river' (line), which is the boundary for each, as illustrated in Figure 7.5.

In this research, Ncuva was incorporated during the SLP. The game  was  infused  with  fraction  concepts  and  presented  to teachers, using a case-based teaching strategy.

Case-based teaching is a pedagogy that emphasises learning from practice. Merseth (1996:724) describes cases as narratives that are infused with dilemmas that can be analysed from various perspectives. It can assist learners to explore 'the messy problems of  practice'.  It  is  an  attempt  to  bridge  the  so-called  theorypractice divide by providing authentic teaching-learning experiences  and  assessment  opportunities  for  teachers'  PCK. A worksheet with examples was included in the SLP study guide. The case was based on an inexperienced, in-service teacher who incorporated Ncuva into  a  Mathematics  lesson  to  introduce common fractions. The questions the authors defined in the case of Ncuva highlighted  how  participating  teachers  could  incorporate an indigenous game like Ncuva , repurposed to teach fractions in order  for  learners  to  come  to  a  conceptual  and  procedural understanding thereof. According to Gallucci (2008), case-based teaching allows for a critical reflection on participant teachers'

FIGURE 7.5: Ncuva game board.

own  teaching-learning  praxis.  The  use  of  cases  in  teacher professional  development  is  based  on  the  assumption  that teachers,  via  discussion  of  and  reflection  on  cases  (authentic teaching-learning experiences), reflect on how  educational theory can inform practice, and when these teachers enter their classrooms, they will be better prepared for the realities of the classroom  and  will  critically  analyse  their  own  practices  to improve learners' learning by applying sound theories to classroom situations (Malkani &amp; Allen 2005).

## Music and boomwhackers

Everybody knows both music and Mathematics, which form part of our everyday lives. Although music and Mathematics seem to

<!-- image -->

have  no  apparent  connection,  they  share  a  valuable  link.  Few people have the privilege to study music and its theory, while Mathematics  or  Mathematics  literacy  is  a  compulsory  school subject  from  Grade  R-12.  As  was  previously  mentioned,  when Mathematics  is  presented  in  a  rational,  Westernised  abstract manner, some learners feel anxious, have no interest in Mathematics and sometimes experience Mathematics as meaningless. Music, on the  other  hand,  relates  to  feelings  and  emotions  in  people's everyday lives, and people love listening to, making and playing music (Glydon n.d).

In this research, we  used  music  and  boomwhackers  to introduce and practice the common fraction concept.

Boomwhackers (Figure 7.8 and Figure 7.9) are coloured plastic tubes, accurately cut into specific lengths to produce different tones when hit against a surface (table, hand or floor) and work like xylophones. Music symbols (notes such as ♪ ) of a few songs were transposed to mathematical symbols (fraction format, e.g., 1 4 ; 1 2 ). The fractions on the posters we used were colour-coded to correspond  with  the  tone  and  the  specific colour of the corresponding boomwhacker. The size of the fraction indicated the time duration of the hit.

Learners' Mathematics performance and attitudes improve as a result of teaching Mathematics and music in an integrative way (An &amp; Capraro 2011). When Mathematics is contextualised, both cognitive and affective experiences are included (Selwyn 1993), which impact positively on their performance in Mathematics.

## Puppetry

The puppets used in this research portray various cultures across South Africa. Animal characters are also used, as animals have a rich  history  in  especially  some  of  the  cultures.  Storytelling  is deeply rooted in various South African cultures, and puppetry becomes  a  'vehicle'  where  new  knowledge  is  'discussed'  and 'performed'  in  a  playful  manner.  In  this  research,  we  adapted indigenous tales from San and Sotho people (using the characters in Figure 7.10) and adapted them to a dialogue format. The stories were contextualised and mathematised with certain principles.

The teachers had to act out the dialogue to colleagues, and questions  were  asked  afterwards  as  to  which  Mathematics principles  could  be  integrated  into  such  a  tale.  One  tale  was

<!-- image -->

about Little Hare Harelip (a San tale), which dealt with why a rabbit had a split lip. In the story, the hare had to travel quite a distance in order to deliver a message to 'the men of the veld'. For Intermediate Phase learners, the Mathematics principles of measurement (pertaining to length) were infused into this story questions regarding the distance travelled by the hare could be posed  to  these  learners.  For  Senior  Phase  learners,  analytical geometry  principles  apply  where  the  distance  between  two points (one character and another in the story) could have been used in order for learners to calculate and perform this operation and understand and remember the concept thereof.

The  teachers  were  provided  the  opportunity  to  engage  in developing activities, using the idea of contextualising Mathematics in IKS and developing skills (such as PoP and CL) to implement  these  approaches  in  their  own  classrooms.  The teachers  also  received  some  of  the  resources  to  use  in  their classrooms.

Ethnomathematics was used as the point of departure in the SLPs  presented  across  two  provinces  in  South  Africa.  The professional  development  of  teachers  during  these  SLPs  was aimed  at creating awareness  as  to how  learners' real-life experiences  and  their  IK  can  contribute  to  the  applications  of Mathematics, allowing for decolonisation to occur (Venkat et al. 2009).  During  the  SLP,  the  integration  of  PoP  allowed  the participant  teachers  to  not  only  decolonise  the  Mathematics content but also engage in problem-solving and critical thinking, while  being  professionally  developed  to  incorporate  various learner  identities  into  the  teaching-learning  content  of  school Mathematics (Brodie 2016b).

In this research, we based our SLP's professional development principles  on  the  ZPTD,  as  suggested  by  Warford  (2011).  This author applied the well-known Vygotskyan (1978) construct of the ZPD to a teacher education context. In teacher professional development interventions, teachers are not always provided the opportunity  to  practise  what  they  have  learnt  (Myende  2014). The  SLP  afforded  the  teachers  the  opportunity  to  gain  new knowledge,  practice  and,  by  means  of  a  portfolio,  provide evidence of the application of their newly gained knowledge in their own classrooms. In this research, the ZPTD was applied as seen in Table 7.1.

## Empirical design of the study

The empirical design of the study took the form of a multimethod qualitative approach with elements of phenomenology considered through an interpretivist paradigm. We wanted to establish  the  participants'  lived  experiences  during  the  SLP and after the SLP when they had to contextualise their lessons in IK (games, music and puppetry) based on a PoP. The focus of this study is participants' lived experiences of the affordances of contextualising Mathematics  IKS (games, music  and  puppetry)  using  PoP  during  and  after  a  teacher professional development intervention in ethnomathematics,

contributing to their reflective praxis (metacognition) (Creswell 2014).

Pedagogies  of  play  infused  with  IK  might  hold  affordances that  other  pedagogies  (such  as  transmission-mode  teaching) might not present and may assist teachers in teaching-learning to improve access to concepts, procedures and relationships in abstract  school  Mathematics,  making  it  more  meaningful  and accessible  to  learners  when  contextualised  (Brits  et  al.  2016; Rusling 2009).

## Sampling

The  study  took  place  in  two  South  African  provinces.  Overall, purposive and convenient sampling schemes were applied. In line with the SLP intervention, these sampling schemes catered for minimal  logistical  issues  (Collins,  Onwuegbuzie  &amp;  Jiao  2007). Table 7.2 offers an overview of the number of samples we used per data format collected.

## Data collection instruments

The  instruments  employed  for  data  collection  included  openended  questionnaires,  focus  group  interviews  and  evidencebased  portfolios.  Furthermore,  content  analysis  was  based  on the conceptual-theoretical framework of the study. Participants engaged  in  portfolio  activities,  which  included  metacognitive activities in (ethno)mathematics lessons and classroom activities.

The participants reflected on and engaged in a series of tasks (submitted as an evidence-based portfolio) to develop their own contextualised Mathematics activities or lessons or to use the examples presented at the SLP to plan, adapt and teach lessons in  their  own  classrooms.  A  multi-method  data  collection  plan was implemented. The focus of all the data collection instruments was  on  teachers'  perceptions  of  using  IK  in  Mathematics classes  and  real  experiences  about  their  Mathematics  lessons

(they planned and taught) that were contextualised in IK (games, music or puppetry). The following data collection instruments apply.

## Open-ended questionnaires

In this research, participants completed an open-ended questionnaire based on their views on IK, largely adapted from the  Views  on  Indigenous  Knowledge  (VNOIK)  instrument  by Cronje, De Beer and Ankiewicz (2015).

## Focus group interview

Participants were invited to participate in a focus group interview in  Limpopo.  Twelve  teachers  participated  in  the  focus  group interview.  The  focus  of  this  interview  was  on  contextualising Mathematics in IK (in general) and the Ncuva case.

## Evidence-based portfolios

The  SLP  was  an  accredited  teacher  professional  development intervention. Participants were not obligated to submit portfolios. They  could  choose  whether  they  wanted  to  earn  professional development  points  from  the  Department  of  Basic  Education (DBE)  or  whether  they  wanted  to  obtain  a  certificate  for  the successful  completion  of  the  SLP  in  ethnomathematics  by submitting an evidence-based portfolio.

## Content analysis

In this  study,  we  applied  content  analysis  in  line  with  the conceptual-theoretical  framework  to  explore  the  experiences that  arose  from  an  SLP  in  teacher  professional  development. Data were obtained from a variety of methods, including openended  questionnaires,  a  focus  group  interview  and  evidencebased portfolios.

## Triangulation

In  addition  to  applying  content  analysis,  we  adopted  triangulation as  a  method  for  synthesising  the  findings  obtained  from  this generic qualitative study (with elements of phenomenology) to represent the findings. In addition, as triangulation caters to the validation  of  data  through  the  representation  of  the  multiple methods used, various aspects of the same phenomenon can be presented. Through such cross verification, we corroborated the analysis of content from the data collected and aimed to satisfy  the  readership  regarding  the  validation  of  the  study. Validation and trustworthiness measures included triangulation of the data obtained, inter-coder reliability among the authors and  following  a  multi-method  approach.  Through  inter-coder reliability,  we  signify  the  degree  to  which  different  coders assigned  the  same  themes  to  the  data  content.  The  authors collaborated on the consistency of the themes and followed the guidelines by Elliott, Fischer and Rennie (1999). These guidelines include associating the findings with the conceptual-theoretical framework of the study and providing an in-depth description of the empirical investigation. We also employed within-method triangulation where  open-ended  questionnaires,  the focus group  interview and  evidence-based  portfolios served as different  methods  within  a  qualitative  approach  (Curtin  &amp; Fossey 2007).

## Presentation of the findings

To present our findings, we have identified the following three main themes via a priori coding, which emerged from the openended questionnaires, the focus group interview and evidencebased portfolios, fostering the affordances of IK for Mathematics Education.

## Teachers and teaching: Teachers are of the opinion that their pedagogical content knowledge and metacognitive skills improved

Participants  reflected  critically  on  their  own  teaching-learning praxis. The following sub-themes emerged, and we provide data that underpin the sub-themes.

Firstly, the appreciation of PoP (games, music and puppetry) to contextualise Mathematics, contributing to their overall PCK:

Learners like to play all the time. When I invited them to play, they were very excited and I could see they understood the lesson. (P11, undisclosed gender, date unknown)

Learners  learn  easy  through  play.  The  transition  from  playing Morabaraba into  classifying  geometry  concepts  from  the  board game, will be better facilitated through the development and use of a worksheet. (P10, undisclosed gender, date unknown)

There is room for play in Mathematics. Mathematics doesn't need to be rigid  [...]  We  can  play,  be  noisy  and  work  with  or  play  against or  differ  from  peers.  We  should  learn  to  communicate  differences and resolve problems collaboratively. (C10, undisclosed gender, date unknown)

Initially I was stressed using puppets, but when I saw how much the learners were enjoying and focussing on the puppets, I relaxed. In the end, I enjoyed it as much as the learners did. I think because learners are enjoying puppets, their learning accelerates […] games are good for concentration […] The class was noisy […] Learners who used to be  passive  were  […]  discussing  symmetry  and  planning  solutions. There was no time to talk other stuff, but they have enjoyed it. (C4, undisclosed gender, date unknown)

Secondly, teachers' views on contextualising Mathematics in IK in Mathematics lessons became more nuanced and changed their views on their overall teaching-learning:

Learners  were  quick  to  show  me  two  games  they  play  in  the Calvinia  area.  These  games  require  you  to  jump  from  one  figure

to  the  next  one.  You  have  to  draw  different  figures  in  the  sand. The  one  is  called  Michael  Jackson  Hockey  and  the  other  one  Ten Hare. (C9, undisclosed gender, date unknown)

I am 'hooked' on the use of indigenous games […] and my learners are  too.  I  start  everyday  with  indigenous  games.  (C9,  undisclosed gender, date unknown)

Success rates implementing indigenous games are high. It changes learners'  attitude  towards  the  subject.  I  see  their  enthusiasm  and participation […] when there is time on hands, they play the games. (C9, undisclosed gender, date unknown)

I  designed  a  game  based  on  sheep  farming  because  most  of  the learners  live  on  or  their  parents  work  on  sheep  farms  in  the  area. Learners are allowed to play the game toward the end of the lesson. Playing games is fun and learners don't think they are learning. In this game learners compete against one another. (C10, undisclosed gender, date unknown)

Thirdly, teachers realised the need for collaborative lesson study where they could learn with and from one another:

I got the opportunity to meet up with other educators and we shared our frustrations and came up with ways of how to solve them. (P1, undisclosed gender, date unknown)

In the  future  when  presenting  lessons  […],  I  will  consult  with educators who are more knowledgeable. (P16, undisclosed gender, date unknown)

I will adjust my mind-set by creating support groups with colleagues and reading more books and journals. (P15, undisclosed gender, date unknown)

There is a need for teachers to work together on problem-solving before  teaching  it to learners. (P21, undisclosed  gender,  date unknown)

Colleagues can discuss (a PoP) during subject meetings. The 'trick' will be to plan something (a working document) to present at the meeting that will be interesting to them. (C10, undisclosed gender, date unknown)

- I would  like  to  share  my  experiences  with  my  colleagues  and encourage  them  to  also  implement  (the  indigenous  games).  (C4, undisclosed gender, date unknown)

## Fourthly, teachers took responsibility for their own learning:

I will do research on indigenous knowledge and talk to older people in the community so that I can get better ways to reach the learners and make Mathematics fun for them. (C6, undisclosed gender, date unknown)

I realised that one is never too old to learn. I thought the way I was teaching was perfect, but I saw that the new approach worked well. I realised that I don't have sufficient indigenous knowledge that can simplify our lives. (C7, undisclosed gender, date unknown)

I realised that one can't put everything you do in a box and later take it out to work with it again. You, as the teacher should be innovative yourself:  think  about  strategies,  plan  lessons  and  monitor  your learners. You can get solutions to the challenges in your situation. (C9, undisclosed gender, date unknown)

Fifthly,  teachers  commented  on  affective  outcomes  of  the SLP:

- I got a lump in my throat, when I saw how much the learners were enjoying the lesson. I could also observe that the learners were not arguing … and no disciplinary challenges occurred. (C7, undisclosed gender, date unknown)
- I  feel  good about everything. I like learning new things and I have learnt about myself as well. You have made me think about teaching in different ways. (C4, undisclosed gender, date unknown)

When learners were playing Morabaraba and the other games, I have felt closest to my learners. They had been so excited and positive that I felt I could change the world with them. (C9, undisclosed gender, date unknown)

Both  the  learners  and  I  had  a  positive  experience  of  the  lesson. Learners  were  very  excited  because  they  understood  the  work. I  think  it's  because  I  have  included real-life examples. The learners participated in the discussion. (C10, undisclosed gender, date unknown)

Sixthly, teachers realised how their teaching benefitted from their own reflection:

As the teacher, I have to reflect on a daily basis on what worked and what didn't work. What didn't work, you have to change it to make it easier for the learners… Reflection taught me to look critically at myself, change isn't easy but necessary. I will definitely use puppetry again in my maths classroom. (C4, undisclosed gender, date unknown)

Teachers were able to reflect critically  on  their  own  teachinglearning  praxis  and  on  a  PoP  that  created  an  environment  in which games, music and puppetry could be 'experimented' with, resulting in some successful experiences. Mathematics teachers are appropriately placed with their mathematical knowledge to translate the learners' knowledge into meaningful mathematical explorations.

However,  certain  challenges  regarding  participant  teachers' teaching-learning also emerged from the data.

Seventhly, teachers mentioned that they were underprepared to integrate IK in Mathematics lessons:

At times, it was difficult to control learners because learners in this Mathematics  classroom  have  not  been  exposed  to  playing  board games  before  during  the  Mathematics  period.  (P10,  undisclosed gender, date unknown)

I didn't  know  that  incorporating  IK  can  assist  the  learners  to understand mathematical concepts so easy. I am a teacher who is eager to learn all the time. The curriculum is changing all the time and new approaches to mathematical problems are ever changing to suit the current situation on which I need to be on par with. (P4, undisclosed gender, date unknown)

Planning  this  lesson  was  a  bit  frustrating  and  finding  the  link  to incorporate IK was difficult. (P3, undisclosed gender, date unknown)

Enough  resources  to  use  will  help  overcome  overall  difficulty  in implementation of IK. (P8, undisclosed gender, date unknown)

Although  these  challenges  were  mentioned  by  participants, there  is  a  need  for  frequent  follow-up  workshops  to  ensure

sustainability of teachers' efforts to contextualise Mathematics in IK using a PoP.

The findings in this research support the findings of research conducted by Avalos (2011), concerning the collaboration between teacher participants at professional development interventions, where they tend to share ideas and experiences, becoming more aware of problems (and conceptualising solutions) faced in the teaching-learning of Mathematics. Teachers need to experiment with and reflect on what they attain during the intervention and compare it with their own professional environments (Girvan, Conneely &amp; Tangney 2016).

## Learners and learning: Teachers reported on enhanced learning in the classroom and the realisation of affective outcomes

Participants  reflected  on  learners'  learning.  The  following  subthemes emerged.

Firstly,  teachers commented on the affective affordances of PoP for learners and their learning:

Learners enjoyed the activities a lot. They were all eager to play. (P11, undisclosed gender, date unknown)

Learners were all excited and volunteered to take turns in their participation of the games, music and puppetry. Even the weaker learners had the opportunity of contributing during the lesson. (P3, undisclosed gender, date unknown)

I started to get learners' attention while unpacking the new game ( Morabaraba ) and explaining to them that we are going to  use  the  game  in  the  Mathematics  lesson.  They  were  very curious about the game, because they didn't know the game. I explained  the  game  rules  and  was  surprised  that  they understood  the  rules  and  mastered  the  game  in  no  time. I continuously prompted them about 2D figures. (C7, undisclosed gender, date unknown)

The learners enjoyed identifying the figures and going out to find the figures in nature and afterwards painting the figures on stones. They were amazed to find the 2D-figures in nature. Their  self-confidence  grew  and  they  mentioned  that  they felt an appreciation for nature. (C3, undisclosed gender, date unknown)

The enthusiasm of the learners amazed me: they mastered the game; they played collaboratively, they understood the concepts of 2D geometry figures - even the weaker learners did [ understand and  play ]. (Unknown  participant,  undisclosed  gender,  date unknown)

Secondly, teachers spoke about enhanced learner understanding of Mathematics concepts using a PoP:

The assessment of learners' worksheets showed that they were able  to  discover  and  learn  the  concept  of  fractions  embedded within  the Ncuva board  game.  (P10,  undisclosed  gender,  date unknown)

The Morabaraba game had a holistic approach regarding the teaching of  geometry  -  learners  were  able  to  relate  easily  to  the  different concepts involved. (P12, undisclosed gender, date unknown)

What learners learn is determined by how they learn. (C10, undisclosed gender, date unknown)

I realised again the learning in groups is important in the classroom. Learners learn from one another because they use the same language. (C3, undisclosed gender, date unknown)

If we learn in a playful manner, it will create a nice atmosphere in my class  and  learners  will  more  freely  participate  in  activities  [...]  and learners are happier and they will understand the work better. (C4, undisclosed gender, date unknown)

Thirdly,  teachers  mentioned  that  learners  are  motivated  and engaged in the new learning environment:

The integration  of  IK  resulted  in  a  classroom  where  learners  were able to share their views and justify their thinking processes. (P10, undisclosed gender, date unknown)

My learners enjoyed my class so much, that they do not want to miss another class. (P13, undisclosed gender, date unknown)

I  realised  that  my learners grasped the subject matter more easily when using indigenous games rather than ordinary scenarios. They were  actively  involved  and  motivated  to  learn.  (P16,  undisclosed gender, date unknown)

Indigenous games motivated the learners and they enjoyed working together. (P10, undisclosed gender, date unknown)

Fourthly, teachers commented on how such PoP could address cultural diversity:

It provided  the  opportunity  for  interaction  among  the  different learners in my classroom. (P19, undisclosed gender, date unknown)

The  incorporation  of  IK  in  my  classroom  will  lead  to  learners, becoming adults who appreciate other cultures and other- and own value. (P3, undisclosed gender, date unknown)

They (the learners) understand more than ever before that different cultures can learn from one another and that we are inseparable in learning and living. All have interesting and important materials we have to use to make a success for all. (C9, undisclosed gender, date unknown)

The overall response when infusing lessons with IK (via games, music and puppetry) were well received among learners, and participants could see a difference in their learning. A challenge that emerged under this theme, according to the participants, is:

- · These challenges are difficult in a multi-racial, young South Africa, but IK provides an all-inclusive learning space where learners  not  only  learn  from  one  another  but  also  stay engaged (maybe across multi-grade or overcrowded classrooms). (Unknown  participant, undisclosed gender, date unknown)

While transfer of knowledge, skills and characteristics is the ultimate goal of all education, learners are expected to internalise what they learn in school and apply it to real life. Educational

success is no longer mainly about reproducing content knowledge but about transferring what we know and being able to apply that knowledge, skills and character in new contexts or situations. These changes require different pedagogies in teaching Mathematics (Fadel, Bialik &amp; Trilling 2015).

## Systemic factors such as the school environment, parents and language may impede the transfer of indigenous knowledge and skills

Another sub-theme that emerged from participants' responses was the influence of the school environment and parents.

Teachers are of the opinion that parents cannot support their children with IK assignments:

Parents  are  illiterate and  cannot  assist  learners  at  home  with homework […] Indigenous games are on the learners' level, they can bring things from home and still be able to learn. (P6, undisclosed gender, date unknown)

The  school  is  located  in  a  very  poor  district  and  the  parents  are dependent  on  grants,  influencing  the  discipline  at  the  school  and leading  to  overcrowded  classes.  (P18,  undisclosed  gender,  date unknown)

Parents in the community are not interested in the school or their children  -  they  show  no  interest  and  accountability  towards  their children. They  don't attend parent-evenings. (C10, undisclosed gender, date unknown)

The use of IK in the form of games, music and puppetry allowed for an overall positive school environment. From the participants' responses, the following barriers surfaced in this theme.

The teachers mentioned the CAPS, time management and a lack of resources as challenges in their schools, in using PoP:

I  would like to improve my time management when giving lessons like these. (P14, undisclosed gender, date unknown)

IK  is  an  interesting  concept  to  integrate,  although  the  availability of resources, effective time management and a lot of topics to be covered  in  the  CAPS  plays  a  role.  (P9,  undisclosed  gender,  date unknown)

The  overloaded  curriculum  and  the  time  schedule  provided  by the  Department  of  Basic  Education  challenges  both  teachers  and learners. (C10, undisclosed gender, date unknown)

A  lack  of  finances  to  buy  calculators  for  learners  at  schools  who serves a poor community, teachers […] get demotivated […]. (C10, undisclosed gender, date unknown)

Teachers  mentioned  that  overcrowded  classes  and  lack  of discipline negatively influenced their daily teaching:

I will  have  to  improve  on  time  management  when  teaching  IK, since  I  teach  in  very  overcrowded  classrooms  in  a  township.  (P6, undisclosed gender, date unknown)

At times, it was difficult to control learners because learners in this Mathematics  classroom  have  not  been  exposed  to  playing  board games  before  during  the  Mathematics  period.  (P10,  undisclosed gender, date unknown)

Discipline is an enormous problem at my school - every day you have to struggle through the chaos of no discipline. There is no culture of learning in my school. (C7, undisclosed gender, date unknown)

Teachers  mentioned  that  language  barriers  are  a  challenge  in multi-lingual classrooms:

The most difficult  part  of  teaching  the  lesson  was  letting  learners construct their own rules or patterns. This was because of the language barrier. Learners need to have more Mathematics vocabulary to help them  construct  their  own  questions  and  most  importantly,  think constructively  about  Mathematics.  (P1,  undisclosed  gender,  date unknown)

These were the most common challenges experienced among the participants, but overall, the affordances of contextualising Mathematics topics or themes in IK (in the form of games, music

and puppetry) seem to have overcome the reality of the school environment and the surrounding community. These approaches were cost-effective because learners were able to bring waste materials from home to enrich and engage the teaching-learning experience together with their Mathematics teachers.

## Conclusion

In order to teach 21st century learners, a 21st-century teachinglearning approach is necessary where learners' expertise, imaginations, playfulness and improvisational competence comes to the fore - all of which is present when a PoP is used in the classroom (Miyazaki 2010).

Brown (2008) states that learning is contextualised owing to the influences of the environment. The participants were able to reflect on  their  own  teaching-learning  praxis.  They  acknowledged  the affordances of contextualising Mathematics topics or themes in IK (in  the form of games, music and puppetry) and also suggested strategies for self-improvement and collaboration between themselves and their colleagues in the future. The impact of IK on the  learning  environment  was  overall  positive  as  teachers  in  the interviews and evidence-based portfolios highlighted that learners displayed  enjoyment,  participation,  enhanced  understanding  and curiosity.  The  systemic  factors  such  as  the  school  environment, albeit  challenging  (socio-economically),  provided  a  context  for learning, which was also a positive attribute, as it enhanced social skills  and  collaboration  despite  being  pressurised  by  a  contentladen curriculum and few resources.

This research was conducted in the context of teachers in two provinces in South Africa. The data illustrate the need for such continuing professional development SLPs - using metacognition as reflective methodology. However, based on our experiences in these two provinces, and based on design principles that were distilled, the SLP should be redesigned for other provinces, taking

local context into consideration. An aspect to consider in future SLPs is CAR, where teachers engage in joint teaching and CAR with peers, in attempts to contextualise (decolonise) Mathematics topics and mathematise it. Gravett and De Beer (2015) show that CAR  can  assist  teachers  in  becoming  more  critical  reflective practitioners. If teachers continue to implement and practise this enhanced PCK they have obtained, they would master the content provided during the intervention (Osborne et al. 2013). The most important aspect is that teachers would transfer what they have learnt to their classrooms and schools. According to Girvan et al. (2016),  teachers  need  to  experiment  with  and  reflect  on  what they  attain  during  SLPs  and  while  in  their  own  professional environments.  According  to  Myende  (2014),  teachers'  views, ideas and expertise should be included in the design phases of contextualising Mathematics topics in IK.

Future  research  should  focus  on  the  implementation  and integration of the Tshimologo Mathematics Shoestring Kit (funded by the Fuchs Foundation) in the Mathematics classroom, which was developed during the course of this research by one of the authors (Van der Walt).

## Summary

To use Mathematics effectively is part of our lives and the 21st century  world  of  work.  The  need  for  content  relevance  and contextualised work embedded in Mathematics learning could enable teachers to share their teaching experiences with others and, in doing so, help develop contextualised lessons, reflect on practices and implement new  pedagogies. Contextualised Mathematics aims at making Mathematics more accessible and meaningful to all learners. There is, however, a need for research invested in Mathematics teachers' PCK in their own local and IK contexts, and their own readiness to contextualise and mathematise it. This chapter presents the research conducted on a developed SLP - as an intervention for professional teacher development  -  at  one  university,  implemented  across  two

provinces in 2016-2017. Participating teachers had the opportunity to play Ncuva and Morabaraba to see how Mathematics can be contextualised in these two games. Ncuva was used to help learners with the concept of common fractions, and  figures  were  cut  off  a Morabaraba board  to  introduce 2D-geometry  concepts  from  a  familiar  situation.  We  used magnetic mathematical vocabulary strips as well as grid paper. Teachers  were  also  presented  with  posters  with  music  tunes transposed as common fractions and colour-coded to correspond with the boomwhacker of the same colour. In this chapter, we have presented the findings on the affordances of contextualising Mathematics topics in IK contexts (e.g. games, music, and puppetry). Data were obtained from the participating teachers by means of open-ended questionnaires, a focus group interview  and  evidence-based  portfolios  (consisting  of  lesson plans and reflections). Content analysis was used to establish three main themes, dealing with teachers and teaching, learners and learning, and school environment and parents. Participants had an overall positive experience of attending the SLP as well as of transferring the knowledge gained during the SLP to their own classrooms.  However,  various  challenges  arose  based  on their  limited  PCK  and  IK;  they  were  never  prepared  for  or introduced to planning and teaching contextualised Mathematics topics. Challenges such as the content-laden CAPS curriculum and a tight work schedule (pace-setters) for the completion of topics, limited the implementation of what had been learnt at the SLP or prevented them from compiling and submitting the evidence-based portfolio. It seems as if some of the participants who  did  submit  portfolios  were  unfamiliar  with  reflective practice. The first affordance of contextualising Mathematics in IK was the participants' positive responses to the opportunity they had to improve their own PCK and that they were introduced to  Mathematics  contextualised  in  IK.  It  was  confirmed  that participants were provided a space where they could talk, listen, learn, design lessons, present lessons, discuss and reflect during the  SLP  and  in  their  portfolios.  The  reflection  done  in  the portfolios, open-ended  questionnaires and a focus group

interview enabled them to look at themselves through a lens of self-improvement  based  on  their  teaching-learning  actions, transferring the SLP skills and knowledge to their own classrooms for effective, accessible and meaningful teaching-learning experiences in some Mathematics topics. The second affordance theme  that  emerged  was  about  participants'  experiences  of their learners enjoying (affective aspect of learning) the contextualised Mathematics lessons and understanding (learning) Mathematics. The last affordance theme focussed on challenges  most  schools  experience,  such  as  lack  of  funding, lack of discipline or lack of parental support and overcrowded classrooms - all factors that might influence such contextualised Mathematics teaching and learning.

## Introduction

According to UNESCO (2017):

[ L ]ocal  and  indigenous  knowledge  refers  to  the  understandings, skills and philosophies developed by societies with long histories of interaction with their natural surroundings. For rural and indigenous

How to cite: Havenga, M., 2019, 'Engaging in indigenous technology: Conceptualisation and contextualisation in problem-based environments', in J. De Beer (ed.), The decolonisation of  the  curriculum  project:  The  affordances  of  indigenous  knowledge  for  self-directed learning (NWU Self-directed Learning Series Volume 2), pp. 223-248, AOSIS, Cape Town. https:/ /doi.org/10.4102/aosis.2019.BK133.08

people, local knowledge informs decision-making about fundamental aspects of day-to-day life. (n.p.)

Gandile,  Tessema  and  Nake  (2017:168,  169)  stipulate  that  IK encapsulates among others local knowledge, traditional knowledge, health knowledge, ecological knowledge and indigenous technical knowledge. They argue that 'IK develops in local contexts to solve local problems', for example, the maintaining  of  human  livelihood  (Gandile  et  al.  2017:167,  169). From an epistemological point of view, IK is based on inherited knowledge and associations. Indigenous knowledge is used by individuals  who  relate  to  distinctive  indigenous  environments and cultural assets, which comprise values, beliefs and practices as developed over time and as communicated across generations (Gumbo 2015; Jones, Buntting &amp; De Vries 2013; Lanzano 2013). Indigenous knowledge involves inherited experiences of observation, instinct and the sharing of ideas (Shubeena et al. 2018). Consequently, it is owned in a particular cultural setting and elaborates on the situated knowledge of parents, family, the elders and ancestors in a community. The conjecture of IK may involve mechanisms analogue to object-oriented programming, which is a paradigm that incorporates inheritance for the purpose of reuse and extension (Sebesta 2008). A subclass inherits all the functionality from  the superclass and  may  add  additional functionality.  Reuse  of  code  through  inheritance  involves  that programmers can use a class higher up in the hierarchy that is already created without writing it again. Likewise, where inheritance is a matter of principle in IK, the author applies the following mechanisms in the context of IK:

- · Encapsulation :  The  protection  of  knowledge  and  behaviour within a particular community
- · Reuse : The use of IK in well-known contexts as communicated across generations
- · Extension : The elaboration of IK to address local problems
- · Polymorphism (=  many  forms):  The  application  of  IK  in different ways and new contexts to solve local problems.

Thus,  implementation  of  IK  requires  particular  knowledge, skills and behaviours, and these should be preserved for the future.

Incorporating IK into education is crucial to enable learners in valuing the history of their natural environment and nourishing it across  generations.  In  their  policy  documents,  the  DBE focuses  on  'valuing  indigenous  knowledge  systems'  as  a treasured  resource  of  history  and  heritage  (DBE  2011:4).  To adhere to the principles of the policy documents, it is expected of  teachers  to  integrate  their  subjects  with  IK.  Nevertheless, teachers,  especially  technology  teachers,  are  not  necessarily familiar with IK in their subject discipline. Moreover, if one looks at the research literature, it seems as if IK is mainly implemented in  Mathematics,  Life  Sciences  and  Natural  Sciences  curricula (Mentz  &amp;  De  Beer  2017).  Integrating  IK  in  the  technology curriculum has advantages, namely, to address some misconceptions regarding indigenous communities, relate teaching  and  learning  to  community  knowledge,  strengthen learners'  identity  in  society,  facilitate  the  understanding  of 'cultural sensitive pedagogies' and acknowledge the role of IT towards economic benefit for all the people in the community (Gumbo 2015:69).

The challenge for technology teachers is to deal with IK as a component  of  the  curriculum  where  learners  are  actively involved in obtaining such knowledge and developing relevant skills. Moreover, technology teachers should immerse themselves in IK  to  understand  the  traditionally  situated  environment, identify appropriate communal  open-ended  problems  and select suitable learning activities to address problems  in indigenous environments. Hence, the aim of this chapter is to conceptualise IT and apply the CHAT (Engeström 2009) as a lens to contextualise IT and perceive teaching-learning activities in  problem-based  environments  within  traditionally  situated social settings.

## Theoretical overview

## Technology education and problem-based environments

Technology  education  was  introduced  into  the  South  African curriculum with the aim of addressing the need to produce future engineers, technicians and artisans and to develop a 'technologically  literate  population'  to  meet  global  demands (CAPS  2011:8).  Technology  as  a  school  subject  facilitates  the development  of  learners  as  innovative,  creative  and  critical thinkers, as they need to solve problems using design processes and practical skills. Technology in schools aims to:

- 1. develop particular skills to solve technological problems
- 2.  enable learners to understand the technological concepts and knowledge and apply these responsibly
- 3.  emphasise people's views on technology in society regarding particular values, attitudes and behaviours (CAPS 2011).

Some  features  of  technology  involve  the  use  of  authentic contexts  substantiated  in  real  life,  integration  of  theory  and practice, evaluation of processes and  products, and  the provision  of  opportunities  to  deal  with  inclusivity  and  social and  environmental  issues  (CAPS  2011).  The  management  of time,  selection  of  appropriate  resources  and  collaboration  in teams are also fundamental in solving technological problems and  addressing  the  world  of  work  (CAPS  2011).  The  core content  areas  in  technology  education  comprise  the  design process  (investigation,  design,  development,  evaluation  and communication),  structures,  processing  of  materials,  systems and control, as well as technology in society and the environment,  which  include  IT  (CAPS  2011).  Although  school learners are first exposed to the technology discipline in South Africa as part of Natural Sciences in the General Education and Training  (GET)  Phase  (Grades  4  to  6),  in  the  Senior  Phase (Grades 7-9), technology is a subject on its own. Technology is a  compulsory  subject  in  the  GET  and  Senior  Phase.  In  the

Further  Education  and  Training  (FET)  Phase  (Grades  10-12), technology is divided into subjects of specialisation, including Mechanical Technology, Civil Technology and Electrical Technology, as well as Engineering Graphics and Design, all as elective subjects (CAPS 2011).

Alamäki (2018:668) highlights that the teaching and learning of technology does not purely focus on memorising and applying  technological  knowledge  but  also  emphasises  skills such as design, invention and the development of solutions for humans. Problem-based learning has gained recognition around the world as a learner-centred pedagogy that has been used for the  development  of  solutions  in  numerous  disciplines  (Savery 2015). 'Problem-based learning is perhaps the most innovative instructional method conceived and implemented in education, (Hung  2009:118),  as  it  aims  to  enhance  students'  knowledge, problem-solving skills as well as their SDL (Bagheri et al. 2013). Hung  (2009)  argues  that  PBL  is  a  distinguished  approach  to teaching and learning as it personifies human learning because such learning is initiated  when a problem is encountered, and learners  need  to  engage  in  an  inquiry  process.  On  this  note, scholars  concur  that  PBL  provides  learners  with  a  driving question  or  an  in-depth  investigation  as  the  starting  point  of learning  and  promotes  active  learning  (Savery  2015;  ServantMiklos 2018). Moreover, PBL requires engagement in addressing complex problems where learners observe, investigate, decide and reflect on their tasks (Bagheri et al. 2013; Hung 2009; Savery 2015).  Solving  a  problem  may  involve  the  development  of  an artefact where problem- and project-based learning may include aspects  of  the  other  (Kolmos  &amp;  De  Graaff  2007).  Planning, facilitation and assistance from the teacher are integral factors, while  team  discussions,  member  contributions  and  decisionmaking involve learners.

Hung (2009) introduced a PBL 3C3R design process model containing core components and processing components. Core components relate to content, context and connection, whereas processing involves research, reasoning and reflection to assist

in  problem-solving and the development of SDL. Applying IK, the core components involve addressing in-depth content and conceptualisation  of  technology  in  natural  settings,  applying situational knowledge to solve a problem and relating technological  IK  problems  to  the  curriculum.  The  processes involve  the  search  for  knowledge  and  reasoning  as  well  as reflection  to  assist  in  meaningful  engagement  (Hung  2009). Regarding  IK,  processing  components  involve  the  facilitation and guidance of learners in understanding the problem of inquiry and search for information by asking the elders in the community, for example. Reasoning involves making decisions and judgements,  and  drawing  inferences  relating  to  technological problems in IK. Moreover, the solving of open-ended problems and  reflection  are  associated  with  one  another.  The  more challenging a problem is, the greater the need for metacognitive control,  feedback  and  purposeful  reflection  (Havenga  2011), especially in cultural-historical settings not previously known to teachers and learners.

In this study, problem-based environments involve interactive group activities where members apply technological knowledge and skills  in  new  contexts  to  solve  problems  in  ecological  and traditionally situated social settings. The next subsection addresses the conceptualisation of technology within indigenous environments.

## Conceptualisation of technology in indigenous environments

Technology, as a field of study, is described as an applied science, which  involves  the  innovative  and  collaborative  design  and development of  tangible  products  and  goods  with  the  aim  of accomplishing specific objectives and solving real-world problems in practical ways (Engelbrecht &amp; Ankiewicz 2016; Peter 2015). Technology, which is as old as humanity, involves ancient and modern knowledge regarding the development and use of artefacts to address various needs. Borgo et al. (2011) refer to a

technological  artefact  as  an  entity  coming  into  existence  by means of an individual or people carrying out a plan to develop something.

The application of technological knowledge is essential for the design  and  development  of  artefacts  as  usable  objects  for humanity. According to Alamäki (2018:669), technological knowledge  involves  'concepts,  principles,  theories,  and  rules'. Jones et al. (2013) and Ankiewicz (2016) accentuate Mitcham's view  (1994)  that  the  philosophy  of  technology  comprises  the following categories of interest:

- · technology as objects, artefacts and products
- · technology as a distinctive form of knowledge
- · technology as a unit of processes (e.g. development)
- · technological  involvement  in  humanity  and  culture  (volition referring to the values, attitudes and beliefs of IK holders).

With reference to the above-mentioned categories, Jones et al. (2013) argue  that all these categories have  relevance for technology  education.  The  author  integrated  the  views  on technology to conceptualise IT in particular, as shown in Figure 8.1 (abbreviated in the diagram are the main aspects of IT. These are outlined in more detail in the description that follows).

The development of technological artefacts is related to IT in particular. Indigenous technology involves the development and manufacturing  of  tangible  goods  and  artefacts  as  related  to specific cultural settings (Gumbo 2015). Peter (2015) mentions that  African  indigenous  science  and  technology  involve  the development of tools used by African ancestors. Stone tools such as hand axes and blades are examples of artefacts.

Indigenous  technological  knowledge denotes  a  distinctive form of local knowledge (Gandile et al. 2017), inherited from and embedded in societies. Fashola, Osuntade and Shobowale (2010) refer  to  technologies  as  the  body  of  knowledge  accumulated over time where indigenous technologies are in particular referred to as traditional, local or community innovation. They argue that technology as accomplished by means of traditional knowledge

FIGURE 8.1: Conceptualisation of IT.

<!-- image -->

systems  refers  to  indigenous  innovation.  Hence,  indigenous technological knowledge has a dual meaning. Firstly, it embraces the heritage of accumulated technical knowledge in society, and secondly,  it  involves  innovative  knowledge  to  solve  current technological  problems  by  applying  traditional  knowledge  in new situations. People inherently should accept responsibility for knowledge  and  skills  interwoven  in  societies  and  the  passing thereof to the next generation.

Technology  is  also  described  as  a unit  of  processes (Jones et al. 2013;  Mitcham  1994)  and  is  associated  with  human behaviours  such  as  actions  and  processes.  On  the  one  hand, technological actions include crafting, inventing and designing, and on the other hand, technological processes involve manufacturing, operating and maintaining. These concepts may

include aspects of one another (Mitcham 1994). In terms of IT, traditional  artefacts  are  developed  to  solve  local  problems. Development of such artefacts may involve various actions and/ or steps (Table 8.1).

Technological involvement in humanity, culture and heritage is associated with IK. Technology as a human-inspired activity creates opportunities to be involved in cultural settings.

Prusak, Walker and Innes (2015) highlight the wisdom of elders regarding  decision-making  as  important  where  a  community strives  for  consensus  regarding  traditional  values.  Mapesela, Hlalele and Alexander (2012) suggest that learning cannot be left to individuals. They emphasise the role of whole-school communities  to  take  responsibility  (learners,  teachers,  school, family  and  other  stakeholders)  for  creating  sustainable  rural learning ecologies and enhancing young individuals' learning.

## Cultural-Historical Activity Theory as a philosophical lens to contextualise indigenous technology

In this subsection, the author employed the CHAT as a lens to contextualise IT. Cultural-Historical Activity Theory is based on the  work  of  Lev  Vygotsky  who  is  known  for  cultural-historical context in learning, and he emphasises human actions with the aim of dealing with individual and social issues (Herrera 2017). Cultural-Historical Activity Theory comprises particular knowledge, actions and processes, artefacts and products as well as human  involvement  in cultural aspects (Herrera 2017). Moreover, CHAT is a distinct framework that assimilates human thinking and activities within a traditionally situated social setting, as  promoted  by  Engeström  (2009)  who  coined  the  construct 'activity system' (refer to Ch. 2). Fundamental to this framework is the focus on the subject, object, tools, rules, community and the division of labour.

With reference to Figure 8.2, CHAT provides for the integration of  the  philosophical  concepts  regarding  IK  in  technology  (see 'Conceptualisation of technology in indigenous environments' in this  book,  Figure  8.1  and  underlined  in  Figure  8.2),  as  there  is common ground regarding active and social practices in cultural and historical reality. Applying CHAT also provides for enrichment and elaboration of teachers' views pertaining to IK in the discipline of technology.

PBL, problem-based learning; IK, indigenous knowledge.

The four underlined concepts in Figure 8.2, as based on the section in this book entitle 'Conceptualisation of technology in indigenous environments', highlight technological involvement in humanity,  culture  and  heritage;  IT  as  a  unit  of  actions  and processes in society; the development of indigenous technological artefacts; as well as the construction of indigenous technological knowledge  as  embedded  in  societies.  The  dashed  rectangles display the main aspects of CHAT (subject, tools, object, rules,

community and the division of labour). Hence, IT is contextualised as follows:

- · Subject in the activity system involves the infusing of IT into the curriculum (use of CHAT on an institutional plane; Rogoff 1995). Thus, the subject is IT.
- · Cultural tools ('artefacts objectified in material'; Lupu 2011:15) are  drivers  of  active  learning,  actions  and  processes  (see 'Conceptualisation of technology in indigenous environments' in this book; Hung 2009). Development of artefacts requires the application of pedagogical approaches, such as PBL, as based  on  a  question  of  inquiry  (see  'Technology  education and problem-based environments', in this book), and provides opportunities  for  the  practical  design  and  development  of indigenous technological artefacts.
- · Object of activity and outcome develop teachers' knowledge and  skills  and  PCK  as  attributes  in  IT  to  be  capable  of 'competent pedagogical action' (Lupu 2011:15). Indigenous technological  knowledge  comprises  technology-inherited knowledge (concepts, principles, theories and rules; Alamäki 2018:669) and may involve mechanisms, such as encapsulation,  reuse,  extension  and  polymorphism  (see 'Technology  education  and  problem-based  environments', in this book).
- · Rules are  regulation  and  integration  of  actions  to  guide teachers  according  to  the  CAPS  (2011:4)  for  technology education by referring to IK systems 'as a treasured resource of history and heritage'. In addition, the conceptualisation of IT  is  also  required  (see  'Conceptualisation  of  technology  in indigenous environments' in this  book).  Teachers  should  be guided by the 'rules' (tenets of technology and tenets of IT as well as the 'rules' [steps] underpinning PBL).
- · Community involves  participants  in  an  activity  system  who share  the  object  and  apply  the  above-mentioned  rules.  For example, learners, other technology teachers, school community and stakeholders, such as curriculum developers and technology subject advisors, are involved.
- · Division of labour involves division of tasks, roles and responsibilities. Specific roles of a teacher comprise a teacher

as  a  facilitator  of  learning,  a  teacher  as  an  innovator  and  a teacher  as  a  lifelong  learner,  among  others.  Technology teachers may also work together in communities of practice.

## Cultural-Historical Activity Theory at an instructional level: The teaching and learning of indigenous technology

According to Kilpatrick (1986):

Each  age  defines  education  in  terms  of  the  meanings  it  gives  to teaching  and  learning,  and  those  meanings  arise  in  part  from  the metaphors used to characterise teachers and learners. (p. 7)

Cultural-Historical Activity Theory is employed at an instructional level to characterise teaching and learning of IT in this section. The gist of the activity theory is that it is 'a theory of objectdriven activity' (Engeström 2008:3). The third-generation CHAT comprises  two  activity  systems  as  reflective  (mirror  images), two-dimensional objects on a plane (Engeström 2009). CulturalHistorical Activity Theory  is  a  tapestry  of  interwoven  and interacting  systems  and  involves  multiple  viewpoints  within  a social-historical  context.  Hence,  by  using  appropriate  tools, subjects  are  the constructors of  objects  in  these  interacting systems. Regarding CHAT at an instructional level, the teacher guides  and  facilitates  learners,  whereas  a  learner  responds  by sharing ideas within a group as a safe space for assisting one another's learning, reinforcing team activities and constructively developing members' IT knowledge. The author aims to develop more  nuanced  understandings  of  the  epistemological  bordercrossing between IK and technology education.

Cultural-Historical Activity Theory is used in this research as a notional  lens  to  investigate  the  infusion  of  IK  into  the  Senior Phase Technology curriculum. The author applied thirdgeneration  CHAT  to  give  a  juxtaposed  and  cultural-mediated perspective regarding the instruction of IT, where teaching and

learning are both sides of the same coin. Figure 8.3 shows how teaching  and  learning  are  taking  place  between  two  activity systems,  namely,  the  technology  teacher  and  the  learner.  The technology teacher (on the left of Figure 8.3) and learner (on the right)  are  actors  or  'subjects'  (S)  in  this  formal  social  context comprising numerous object-driven activities during instruction. The technology teacher needs to deliberately plan for active and responsible student-centred learning. This involves the selection of appropriate strategies ('tools') such as PBL (T) to mediate and facilitate the development of IT artefacts and to guide learners in the solving of local problems ('the object', O). Identification of  a  community-embedded  IT  problem  is  the  driving  force  of

FIGURE 8.3: Cultural-Historical Activity Theory on instructional level: The teaching and learning of IT.

problem-based projects (T) in this activity system. Furthermore, at the bottom of the triangle, the collective activities are shared, directed and influenced by rules (R), the community (C) and the division of labour (D). In IT, the conceptualisation of technology (see  'Conceptualisation  of  technology  in  indigenous  environments' in  this  book)  as  well  as  the  technology  curriculum  directs activities,  and  the  steps  of  PBL  serve  as  'rules'  in  this  system. Other technology teachers, the school community, technology subject advisor and subject specialist are part of the community, whereas the technology teacher may be part of communities of practice (D).

The activity system on the right involves a learner who applies IK when working in a team to develop an artefact and solve local technological  problems.  Learners  need  to  manage  their  own learning  processes  and  make  decisions  while  developing  a solution  to  the  problem  (T).  The  object  of  the  activity  in  this system is the team member's development of knowledge, skills and philosophical  understanding  of  society  and  the  ability  to solve IT problems. Moreover, a learner may apply mechanisms (see Ch. 8, 'Introduction') to elaborate and reinvent the use of IT to solve local problems. For example, a learner may think about new  ways  of  applying  technology  to  the  advantage  of  the community (polymorphism mechanism). At the bottom on the right,  rules  involve  skill  development  as  outlined  in  the  technology curriculum for the Senior Phase in particular. Assisting learners in indigenous technological knowledge and skill development is the community (C) comprising parents, family and wisdom of the elders, as well as the surrounding communities. The division of tasks, roles and responsibilities involve team members as well as  the  whole  team  to  achieve  the  object  of  activity  (O)  and outcomes.

The  dotted  circles  between  'S',  'T'  and  'O'  represent  the dynamicity of all activities involved in the recursive reflection to achieve the outcomes in both activity systems. In this context, recursive reflection refers to the purposeful action where teachers and learners look back with the aim to 'keep track of what they

are doing' (Kilpatrick 1985:8) to become more effective constructors  of  objects  in  interacting  systems.  To  rephrase Kilpatrick's  (1985)  views  -  reflection  requires  that  we  need  to move outside our mind to get an insight into what is happening inside our mind. Such reflection needs to continue recursively in problem-based contexts until the problem is solved.

Recursion refers to a function that is defined in terms of itself (e.g. my parents are my ancestors and my parents' parents are my ancestors as well). Similarly, reflection is defined in terms of itself to think about one's own thinking. The purpose is to make better  decisions  and  to  learn  from  previous  mistakes  when reflecting before, in and on a task. As such, technology teachers as subject specialists are required to facilitate learners' reflective involvement  in  IK.  In  this  context,  learners  need  to  reflect  on technological knowledge of history and heritage, technological knowledge of local problems and technological knowledge that is  applied  in  new  ways  to  address  challenges.  Teachers'  selfreflection is also important in terms of the instruction in problembased  environments.  The  author  argues  that  self-reflection  is critical  in  both  activity  systems  in  CHAT  to  ensure  that  the outcomes  (object)  are  achieved.  In  addition,  the  technology teacher  needs  to  reflect  on  the  appropriateness  of  tools  to facilitate the innovative construction of an IT artefact. The rules (R),  community (C) and division of labour (D) should assist in reflective activities.

On the other hand, learners need to reflect on their knowledge and practices obtained as a result of social interaction rather than being  transferred  between  humans  (Alamäki  2018).  Postholm (2018:429) reveals the importance of reflection in instruction. He suggests that reflecting together with colleagues leads to 'more reflection' and effectively contributes to teachers' learning. This is  also  true  of  learners  working  together  to  solve  problems. Apparently, personal reflection as well as reflecting together may result in the development of rich experiences in the application of technology to solve IK problems in the community. With regard to the learner, he or she should reflect on responsible teamwork

in  problem-based  environments  when planning,  designing  and developing indigenous technological artefacts. Likewise, reflection aims to enable learners to obtain knowledge and skills regarding  IT  and  apply  these  in  the  community  to  address  a challenge.

Gretschel,  Ramugondo  and  Galvaan  (2015)  stipulate  that the interaction between the two activity systems may involve some  tensions,  may  elicit  some  changes  and  may  require reflective practices. For example, a technology teacher aims to include IT in the curriculum, whereas initially, the learners do not  see  the  advantage  of  obtaining  such  knowledge.  As  a result, some tensions may arise between both activity systems. The  teacher  might  discern  tensions  when  explaining  the rationale of including IT in the curriculum while learners may develop  a  broader  view,  understanding  and  value  thereof. Reflective  discourse  may  enhance  the  preservation  of  IT knowledge and skills.

## Contextualisation of indigenous technology in problem-based indigenous environments

It is essential  that  a  teacher  introduces  learners  to  IK  by employing appropriate teaching methods or strategies. According to Hung (2009:119), 'the effectiveness of an instructional method  is a result of complex inter-causal relationships of numerous  known  and  unknown  variables involved  in  the  instruction/learning  processes'.  Inter-causal relationships are also part of the activity systems for pedagogical interaction.  Activities  are  performed  by  actors  (teacher  and learner as the respective 'subjects'), where both subjects should be dedicated to addressing problems in indigenous environments - the technology teacher as facilitator who pushes the  boundaries  of  the  ZPD  (Vygotsky  1978)  and  provides opportunities  for  learners  to  obtain  indigenous  technological knowledge and skills, and the learner who shares ideas within a

group  to  enhance  one  another's  learning  and  reinforce  the group. Problem-based environments enable actors to be interwoven  to  achieve  the  aims  and  outcomes.  Hung  (2009) highlights scholars' view that learning in problem-based contexts is most  effective when  it focuses on students' understanding and connection between principles and concepts. The technology teacher (S) needs to facilitate knowledge and skill development, select strategies such as PBL to assist learners in the construction of an indigenous technological artefact (T) and enable them to solve community problems (O) (Figure 8.3). In  Table  8.1,  a  framework  for  problem-based  projects  in  IT  is outlined by referring to the teacher as facilitator.

The  left  column  in  Table  8.1  comprises  steps  as  verbs  to highlight the active involvement in problem-based environments (e.g.  conceptualise  and  formulate).  The  mentioned  steps  are adapted from Maurer and Neuhold (2011) and Hemker, Prescher and Narciss (2017) to incorporate the design and development of artefacts as part of problem-based experiences. These steps also  include  the  main  concepts  and  processes  as  outlined  by Hung (2009), namely, content (Step 1),  context  (Step  2)  and connection  (Steps 1 to 7), whereas  processing  refers to researching (Steps 3 and 5), reasoning (steps 3, 4 and 5) and reflection (all the steps) to assist in the solving of indigenous technological problems.

In  the  right  column,  the  steps  are  applied  to  indigenous technological problems in the community where the teacher needs  to  guide  learners  in  the  solving  of  such  problems. Table  8.1  is aligned  with  Figure  8.3  and  emphasises  the continuous reflection between the teacher, tools and objects. Reflection  is  important  to  assist  learners  in  developing  an artefact  to  address  community  problems.  On  this  subject, Ankiewicz  (2016)  highlights  the  use  of  problem-solving  and reflective practices in indigenous communities as core activities and  approaches  when  designing  artefacts.  Furthermore,  the

categories  of  interest  in  the  philosophy  of  technology  are aligned (Jones et al. 2013) and applied in IT:

- · Technology as a distinctive form of knowledge : Conceptualise the  understanding  and  the  rationale  of  using  technology in  IK  (see  'Conceptualisation  of  technology  in  indigenous environments' in this book) (Step 1).
- · Technological  involvement  in  humanity  and  culture : Guide learners to obtain knowledge regarding an IT problem in the community (Step 2) and support the creative and innovative construction of an IT artefact for the community (Step 6), for example.
- · Technology as a unit of processes : Various steps, activities and processes are involved in IT (Steps 2 to 6).
- · Technology as objects, artefacts and products : The design and development of artefacts for the community (Step 6).

## Applying indigenous technology in a short learning programme for teachers

Although  IK is part of the technology  curriculum in the Intermediate Phase, teachers do not necessarily discuss the topic of IK. Moreover, technology teachers are not necessarily familiar with IK in their subject discipline. Thus, extending the learning of technology is essential to include technological artefacts as such artefacts  cannot  be  separated  from  cultural  settings  (Gumbo 2015). Consequently, a three-day SLP was developed by NWU to support teachers in science-related subjects by infusing IK in the classroom using CL and PBL approaches (White &amp; De Beer 2017). Technology  teachers  worked  together  in  an  SLP  by  designing and developing an IT artefact such as a bridge. These teachers used  appropriate  materials,  proper  construction  techniques, decision-making skills and effective ways to solve the problem on hand. They developed an artefact and assigned responsibilities to  members.  On  this  subject,  Darling-Hammond,  Hyler  and

Gardner  (2017:8)  opined  that  'the  opportunity  for  teachers  to engage in the same learning activities they are designing for their students  is  often  utilised  as  a  form  of  active  learning'.  They elaborate,  stating  that  'curricular  and  instructional  models  and modeling of instruction help teachers to have a vision of practice on  which  to  anchor  their  own  learning  and  growth'  (DarlingHammond et al. 2017:11).

The following scenario can be given to technology teachers in an SLP: people have to cross a river to get to banks, shops and medical facilities in the town. Furthermore, children need to cross the bridge to go to school and the elderly need to collect their government grants in town. At times, this can also be dangerous, especially  when  the  water  level  rises  after  rains.  The  closest bridge is far away. Crocodiles have also been spotted in the area. As a result, a bridge should be constructed for the community. It must  be  long  enough  to  allow  people  cross  the  river  safely without needing to walk on the riverbanks. Technology teachers are requested, as part of an SLP in IT, to develop a bridge artefact using dowel sticks, rope and glue. Teachers need to address this ill-defined problem  in  small  groups;  apply  problem-solving, critical and  reflective thinking; be innovative; and  employ particular 'tools' (Havenga  2015).  The  number  of  teachers collaborating may depend on the context. Ideally, they can work in groups of two or three on the problem. To give meaning to the learning  experience,  teachers  need  to  actively  construct  their own knowledge to address a problem by themselves. Similarly, these are core activities when developing indigenous technological artefacts (Gumbo 2015). This is the practical part of  an  SLP  where  teachers  obtain  the  required  knowledge  and skills  by  interacting,  and  experimenting,  with  one  another.  In Table 8.1, a framework for problem-based projects in IT is outlined. In  Table  8.2,  the  mentioned  steps  are  applied  where  teachers need to develop indigenous technological knowledge and skills as part of an SLP.

Consequently, by implementing an SLP, new knowledge and practices are constructed by means  of  social interaction

between  technology  teachers.  In  addition,  the  technology teacher  may  work  in  various  cultural  contexts  as  part  of communities of practice to explicitly develop skills concerning IT.  The  knowledge  gained  in  technology  can  be  applied  in multiple cultural contexts and traditional, ecological environments.  Implementing  an  SLP  is  therefore  a  learning endeavour  for  teachers  to  deal  with  meaningful  tasks  in

problem-based contexts where they are influenced by culture. The provisional findings from the SLPs offered to teachers in the Northern Cape in 2017 are the following:

- · An SLP can be effective in providing Technology teachers with  more  nuanced  understanding  of  IT.  Abd-El-Khalick, Bell and Lederman (1998) claim that a relationship exists between teachers' views of the nature of the subject (the tenets of technology, in this case) and how they teach. It is therefore essential that in-service teacher education should provide technology teachers with an understanding of  the  nature  of  both  technology  and  IK.  Regarding  the findings, teachers indicated that they have a better understanding  of  IK  in  their  disciplines  (Seleke,  Speight Vaughn &amp; De Beer 2018).
- · Unfortunately, teachers do not always change their practice (pedagogies) even after attending an SLP. (Refer to Ch. 2, where  Mentz  and  De  Beer  refer  to  the  'wash-out  effect'). Although there were few examples of good PBL that infused IT  after  the  SLP,  most  of  the  technology  teachers  did  not submit  a  complete  portfolio  comprising  their  experiences regarding IK in their subject discipline.
- · Technology teachers indicated that there are several systemic  factors  that negatively  affect the transfer of knowledge and skills after the SLP (Seleke et al. 2018). This include the time frames ('pace-setters') in the official (CAPS) curriculum and the pressure of 'teaching-to-the-test' owing to the focus on good throughput in examinations.

Evidence of transfer to classroom after the SLP is the design of a  bridge that was constructed by the learners of one of the teachers who participated in the SLP (Figure 8.4 to Figure 8.6; Credit:  Portfolio  of  Mr  Aspeling,  submitted  after  the  SLP  in Calvinia).

## Conclusion and recommendations

In  this  chapter,  the  author  conceptualised IT and structured it with  regard  to  problem-based  environments.  The  CHAT  was used as a lens to contextualise IT in problem-based environments. Cultural-Historical Activity Theory was in particular employed to highlight  the  teaching  and  learning  of  IK  and  to  extend  the relevance  and  applicability  of  this  framework  where  teachers develop IK and design problem-based projects, particularly in the discipline of Technology in an SLP. A particular contribution is  the  elaboration  of  CHAT  to  emphasise  the  importance  of reflection between the subject and tools, and the subject and the  object,  with  the  aim  to  achieve  the  outcomes  of  both activity  systems.  Self-reflection  as  well  as  reflecting  together may result in the development of knowledge and rich experiences in IT in the community to solve particular problems. Provisional findings from the SLPs offered to teachers were outlined. A few recommendations with regard to the teaching and learning of IT are provided.

Based on the findings, the following recommendations were made  for  the  teaching  and  learning  of  IT  in  problem-based environments:

- · The teacher needs to understand the value of integrating IT in the technology curriculum and complement 'Western' technology teaching and learning with IT as embedded in rich cultural assets.
- · Teachers should conceptualise IT themselves to enable them to guide learners in the understanding thereof.
- · Problem-based learning, when preferred as teaching-learning strategy, should be emphasised in pre- and in-service teacher education to address open-ended cultural embedded problems by applying technical knowledge and skills.
- · The  limited  SLPs  offered  by  NWU  should  be  expanded  to provide opportunities for the technology teachers to develop knowledge  and  skills  in  IT  and  to  develop  more  nuanced understandings of the epistemological border-crossing between IK and technology.

## Summary

In this chapter, the author firstly conceptualises IT as an essential form  of  knowledge  and  skills  in  natural  surroundings,  and secondly,  the  CHAT  is  used  as  a  lens  to  contextualise  IT  in problem-based environments. Cultural-Historical Activity Theory is  associated  with  the  work  of  the  Russian  psychologist  Lev Vygotsky and is used as a framework in this research to understand the knowledge, activities, associations and human thinking when teaching and learning IT in the Senior School Phase in Grade 9. Local knowledge and IK encapsulate the understandings, skills and philosophies of societies with a rich history  of  interaction with their natural environment. Scholars in the field of IK aim to understand human interaction within this rich heritage. Despite a comprehensive body of research literature in technology education, only a few outputs on IT have been published to date. Addressing this gap, the author attempts to conceptualise IT and to structure it in problem-based environments. Technology is a distinctive form of knowledge and involves processes such as the design  and  development  of  artefacts  as  well  as  technological involvement in humanity and culture. This chapter is a desktop literature  review  of  scholarly  work  on  IT.  This  research  utilised CHAT with regard to the teaching and learning of IT and elaborates on the role of reflection to achieve the outcomes. The purpose was  to  extend  its  relevance  and  applicability  where  teachers develop IK and design artefacts particularly in the discipline of Technology  in  an  SLP.  This  chapter  also  briefly  reflects  on provisional findings that emerged from data collected after a SLP regarding  IK  that  was  offered  to  Technology  teachers  in  the Northern Cape.

## Introduction

This  chapter  focuses  on  the  affordances  of  puppetry  in  the classroom.  Puppetry  is  a  form  of  storytelling  and  thus  is  well aligned with the oral tradition of IK (Shava 2016). We argue that

How to cite: White, L., Bester, S. &amp; Sebotsa, T., 2019, 'The use of puppetry as pedagogy to teach indigenous knowledge', in J. De Beer (ed.), The decolonisation of the curriculum project:  The  affordances  of  indigenous  knowledge  for  self-directed  learning (NWU Self-directed  Learning  Series  Volume  2),  pp.  249-276,  AOSIS,  Cape  Town.  https:/ /doi. org/10.4102/aosis.2019.BK133.09

puppetry is an excellent pedagogy to teach IK in the classroom, as it taps into a central tenet of IK as epistemology. The chapter draws on research data on the use of puppetry in the Natural Sciences  (Life Sciences  and  Physical  Sciences)  and  Social Sciences classroom at a South African university.

Regrettably,  the  Western  curricula  excluded  IK  for  decades (Whatman &amp; Duncan 2005). Unfortunately, as a result, the younger generation  has  lost  interest  in  IK  (Msuya  2007).  Owing  to  this marginalisation or exclusion of IK from the Western curricula, the contextual circumstances of school learners were not considered (Shava 2016). Makari and Kasanda (2013) argue for a connection between  theoretical  knowledge  ('Western'  knowledge)  and  its practical application  in communities  that  are  predominantly indigenous in nature.

Shava (2016) is of the opinion that the epistemological bordercrossing between IK and the Western curriculum could assist in decolonising the curriculum. Shava states that areas should be identified where IK can be infused into curriculum themes. This would  enrich  the  curricula,  and  as  the  lived  experiences  of learners are considered, learners might experience the curricula as more  meaningful and relevant, thereby promoting the attainment of affective outcomes (refer to Ch. 4).

Since  2011,  South  Africa  has  attempted  to  infuse  IK  into  the curricula of various  subjects. Indigenous  knowledge,  among others, is mentioned as one of the principles that should underpin education  (DBE  2011a).  Unfortunately,  research  (e.g.  Cronje,  De Beer  &amp;  Ankiewicz  2015;  De  Beer  2016;  White  &amp;  De  Beer  2017) indicates  that  most  often  only  lip  service  is  paid  to  IK  in  most classrooms.  Abah,  Mashebe  and  Denuga  (2015:672)  state  that 'while  Western  science  offers  broader  appreciation  of  context beyond  the  local  level,  indigenous  knowledge  offers  depth  of experience  in  a  local,  culture-specific  context'.  From  an  ESDC perspective, learning cannot take place in isolation (Hardy-Vallée &amp; Payette 2008) (this is discussed in more detail in Ch. 4). According to Maxwell and Chahine (2013:67), effective learning takes place in

an atmosphere of a learner's 'existing knowledge, background and environment'. Dei (2016) alluded to the importance of background knowledge that learners bring to the classroom when entering the school, which includes IK from a specific cultural group. Teachers should therefore tap into the knowledge of learners to contextualise the curriculum when teaching a specific topic (Dei 2016). However, this is easier said than done. The rich cultural diversity in South Africa  can  pose  challenges,  as  learners  from  different  cultural groups  are  present  within  a  single  classroom,  which  makes  it difficult to decide which IK to infuse into the classroom (De Beer &amp; Mothwa 2013; George 2011).

The  objective  of  this  research  was  to  facilitate  the  bordercrossing  between  Western  knowledge  and  IK  by  introducing puppetry as a vehicle  to  portray  IK  storytelling.  Realising  that teachers are often not sufficiently trained to infuse IK into their lesson plans, NWU  has infused IK elements, and such epistemological  border-crossing,  into  its  pre-service  teacher education  programme.  In  this  chapter,  we  focus  on  the  lived experiences  of  student  teachers  who  engaged  in  puppetry  in selected subject methodology modules. The focus of this chapter is therefore only on Life Sciences, Physical Sciences and Social Sciences (DBE 2011a, 2011b, 2011c) and the lived experiences of student teachers in using puppetry as a pedagogy to teach IK.

## The tenets of the nature of science and indigenous knowledge, and the affordances of puppetry as relevant pedagogy in Natural Sciences

Some teachers still have naïve understandings of the NOS in that they have more positivist outlooks on science, which involve the perception that scientific knowledge can be gained only through observations and experimentation (Ecevit, Yalaki &amp; Kinger 2018). Adedoyin and Bello (2017) confirmed these perceptions in their research on student teachers and expressed concern that, if these

misunderstandings  prevail,  it  would  again  be  carried  over  to another generation of learners. Lederman et al. (2002) gave a good  overview  of  the  tenets  of  the  NOS,  which  includes  its empirical nature, tentative nature, well-established theories and laws. Our research, however, focussed on other tenets, such as the subjectivity of scientific knowledge, the social and cultural context of the NOS as indicated by Sormunen and Köksal (2014), as well as the tenet that human creativity and imagination play a role in science (Cronje et al. 2015).

Indigenous knowledge  can be infused into the Science curriculum. As Cronje et al. (2015) indicate, Western knowledge systems  and  IK  systems  need  not  necessarily  be  in  conflict. The space where IK and Western ways of knowing connect and overlap  can  be  understood  as  the  'cultural  interface'  (Nakata 2002). This can be a contested space but can also be a space where  different  ways  of  knowing  work  together  synergistically. Cronje et al. (2015:323, 324) have shown that there are (despite several differences) many shared tenets when the NOS and the NOIK are compared. Both science and IK are empirical (although IK also has a metaphysical component), both are tentative (and subjected to change), both are inferential, both are creative and both are socially and culturally based. This could facilitate science teaching  that  acknowledges  learners'  knowledge  and  culturally based ways of thinking, which will almost certainly unlock potential to make science more meaningful to them (Cronje 2015).

The affective domain of human thinking in science education is  a  reason  for  the  poor  performance  in  science  that  is  often overlooked (De Beer 2016). Dubinsky, Roehrig and Varma (2013) showed us that experiences with an emotional stamp are more likely to be committed to long-term memory.

Infusing IK into curriculum themes can be illustrated with a few  examples.  In  Physical  Sciences,  for  instance,  traditional leather  tanning  could  serve  as  a  brilliant  way  of  introducing endothermic reactions in the classroom (De Beer 2015; Zaruwa &amp; Kwahe 2014).

The second example is that of indigenous alcohol fermentation. Whisky-like  alcohol  is  produced  by  the  indigenous  people  of southern Africa by fermentation of sugars (in millet, maize and fruits  such  as  marula).  The  fermentation  reaction  of  the  sugar obtained from the ingredients or sugar cane is glucose (sugar) + enzyme ==&gt; ethanol + carbon dioxide. This can be chemically represented as follows: C 6 H 12 O 6(aq) + (enzymes) ====&gt; 2C 2 H 5 OH (aq) + 2CO 2(g) . CAPS Grade 10-12 Physical Science (DBE 2011b) mentions two basic links to alcohol fermentation. Firstly, the preparation of alcohols via different reactions of which the substitution's reactions are the basic preparation method. Secondly, the principle of fractional distillation - the separation of  liquids  based  on  different  boiling  points  -  is  illustrated  by fermentation. This IK example is also suitable to contextualise the Life Sciences curriculum for learners when the topic of anaerobic fermentation  is offered. In Life Sciences  (DBE  2011a),  the importance  of  medicinal  plants  can  also  be  infused  into  the curriculum. Medicinal plants have been used by various IK holders to treat various diseases worldwide. South Africa is no exception with  its  rich  endemic  plant  species  and  herbalists  and  ' muthi ' doctors who have an in-depth knowledge of the uses of these plants. Different parts of the plants, such as roots, bulbs, bark, leaves,  flowers,  fruits  and  seeds,  can  be  used  for  medicinal purposes (Van Wyk &amp; Wink 2012). Indigenous knowledge has a strong  empirical  side  to  it,  and  authors  such  as  De  Beer  and Whitlock (2009) indicated how learners could engage with IK utilising the 'tools' of science and explore the tenets and nature of  Natural  Science.  These  authors  showed  how  a  Kirby-Bauer technique  could  be  used  in  the  science  classroom  to  test  the antimicrobial  properties  of  medicinal  ( muthi )  plants  (refer  to Ch. 4 in this regard).

However, such activities do not address the holistic nature of IK, as IK also has a metaphysical character. Moreover, Gorelick (2014) refers to metaphors that characterise IK and that knowledge is often encapsulated by such metaphors and stories. This metaphysical and creative aspect could also be addressed in the science classroom

by  engaging  puppetry  as  a  storytelling  medium  (which  is  the focus of this chapter), where learners can discuss whether certain aspects of IK should be seen as pseudoscience (White &amp; De Beer 2017) or whether we have a naïve understanding of IK. For instance, De Beer and Van Wyk (2018) discussed the use of impinda ( Adenia gummifera ),  which  was  traditionally  used  to  'expel  evil  spirits'. Clinical tests have shown that impinda has a strong antimicrobial activity that can kill bacteria. For IK holders who were not familiar with the word bacteria, an 'evil spirit' caused the illness and their solution was to use impinda as a cure (refer to Ch. 4).

Puppets and storytelling can provide a vehicle to infuse arts and  science  and  thereby  address  the  affective  domain.  Albert Einstein,  who  also  was  a  violinist,  is  a  good  example  of  the complementarity  of  art  and  science. He  spoke  about  the importance of music in helping him become a creative thinker. Albert  Einstein  (Einstein,  Calaprice  &amp;  Dyson  2010)  has  been quoted saying:

Where the world ceases to be the scene of our personal hopes and wishes, where we face it as free beings, admiring, questioning, and observing, there we enter the realm of art and science. We do science when we reconstruct in the language of logic what we have seen and experienced: we do art when we communicate through forms whose connections are not accessible to the conscious mind yet we intuitively recognize them as something meaningful.

For  a  magazine  on  modern  art,  Menschen,  Zeitschrift  neuer  Kunst (19 February 1921). (p. 234)

Leonardo da Vinci, renowned for his paintings, also had scientific aptitude  (Kemp  2006).  These  individuals  demonstrated  the tenets  of  art  and  science  in  their  work.  Some  researchers see  science  and  art  sharing  many  similar  tenets  (Yakman  &amp; Lee 2012). These tenets form the basis for a STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics) framework, and Yakman and Lee (2012) are of the opinion that fusing arts into science results in learners becoming more flexible in their thinking and  in  the  process  of  adopting  intellectual  skills  and  other attitudes that make them more adaptable to life.

The Lincoln Center Education (2018) identifies a number of capacities for imaginative thinking, namely:

- · Notice  deeply  -  identify  and  articulate  layers  of  detail  in  a work or artefact.
- · Pose  questions  -  use  questions  persistently  to  reposition thinking and generate curiosity beyond conclusions.
- · Make  connections  -  relate  what  you  notice  to  your  own knowledge and experience, and other people's perspectives.
- · Identify  patterns  -  find  and  analyse  relationships  among details.
- · Embody - explore ideas or objects of study physically.
- · Empathise -respect diverse perspectives, feel for the experiences of others.
- · Live with ambiguity - understand that issues have more than one interpretation.
- · Create meaning- form your own interpretation.
- · Take action - realise what you imagine, in the world and in your community, based on what you have learnt.
- · Reflect  and  assess  -  pause  and  examine  what  you  have done. (p. 4)

We  believe  that  the  above  capacities  are  equally  relevant  in science and in arts, and that puppetry could be a good vehicle to address these capacities.

Infusing  arts  into  science  can  be  done  by  contextualising knowledge for learners using puppetry to help storytelling, which could be utilised in the science classroom to make science more interesting to learners (De Beer 2016). Chinyowa (2001) argues that  African  storytelling  is  a  powerful  pedagogical  tool  for communicating people's knowledge and wisdom.

## Cultural artefacts and the affordances of puppetry as relevant pedagogy in Social Sciences

In  this  section,  the  concept  of culture is  discussed,  because stories and storytelling are some of the aspects of culture, and

puppetry is a corollary thereof. Therefore, it is necessary to give an overview of the main aspects of culture.

Idang (2015) and Mawere (2015) argue that cultural artefacts are generally divided into tangible culture and intangible culture. In  Natural  Sciences,  IK  can  be  infused  into  the  classroom  by addressing the NOS and the NOIK. Social Sciences, on the other hand,  can  instil  IK  by  concentrating  on  cultural  artefacts.  The tangible cultural relics refer to material objects such as historical buildings, monuments,  statues  and  declared  heritage  sites. Clothing,  beadwork,  fine  art  as  well  as  architectural  evidence and palaeontological remains are also tangible artefacts. Other elements of culture such as traditional songs, music, food and craftsmanship  are  regarded  as  intangible  cultural  artefacts. Traditions,  proverbs,  storytelling,  folktales,  rituals  and  festive events are also included in these. Belief systems such as religions are also considered as an intangible cultural artefact (Lenzerini 2011) (refer to Ch. 4 where the authors indicate how multimodal learning supports the doctrine of ESDC).

Storytelling  can  then  be  considered  as  an  artefact,  and according to Tobin and Snyman (2007), the word story (meaning an  account  of  incidents  or  events)  has  its  origins  in  the  13th century,  with  roots  in  both  French  and  Latin.  In  this  context, Deacon  and  Stephney  (2005:24)  state  that  'stories  bring  the community and its members together in a shared understanding of the world and their place in it', because through stories, one learns about identity, history, society and the world (Cherry 2017).

In Social Sciences, there is a strong focus on the rich cultural diversity of South Africa - isiZulu, isiXhosa and Khoi-san cultures to name but a few. Examples in Social Sciences (DBE 2011c) (in the  History  section)  where  puppetry  and  storytelling  can  be applied  as  a  pedagogical  tool  are  first  addressed  in  Grade  4. Here, the curriculum content addresses the history of local areas through  stories and  interviews with people. The  Grade  5 curriculum focuses on stories from hunter-gatherers and herders that portray the Khoi-san culture and beliefs. Furthermore, the

rich heritage of Khoi-san rock paintings can be used as a form of storytelling,  as  these  paintings  depict  their  customs  such  as hunting and clothing (Eastwood 2006; Seroto 2011). (Some of the  vignettes  in  Chapter  4,  such  as  the  one  on  the  blackshouldered kite, could also be a good script for puppetry.)

## Teaching methodology

As storytelling through puppetry could be used to infuse IK into both the Natural Sciences and Social Sciences curricula, the value of  storytelling  and  puppetry  as  teaching  methodology  in  the curriculum was the focus of this research.

## Storytelling

Storytelling  can  be  regarded  as  the  earliest  form  of  teaching. Before written language was developed, people told stories to preserve history, traditions and taboos (Dujmovic 2006). Thus, storytelling is an important part of human culture, and the past has always been organised and shaped through stories (Hawkey 2007). African storytelling was also used for educational purposes and portrayed the African philosophy (Chinyowa 2001). It was used  to  interpret  the  universe,  to  resolve  natural  and  physical phenomena, to teach morals, to maintain cultural values, to pass on methods of survival and to praise God (Utley 2008). African storytelling  was  a  ritual  that  usually  took  place  in  the  evening after a hard day's work. The villagers would gather around a fire and  settle  down  to  listen  to  stories  (Tuwe  2016).  Storytelling therefore  was  the  medium  of  choice  to  preserve  their  history, traditional  culture,  beliefs  and  ritual  ceremonies  (Namulundah 2011).

Repetition  was  an  important  characteristic  of  African  oral storytelling.  The  audience  partook  in  the  ambience  of  these stories  because  they  imitated  the  motions  and  repeated  the words  of  the  storytellers. Repeating  the  stories facilitated the  understanding  of  these  stories,  which  also  enabled  the

audience to recollect these stories at a later stage. (Refer to the section on mnemonic networks in Ch. 5). The purpose of these stories was also to transmit important features of their cultural ways to other members of the community (Utley 2008). It also provided  the  children  with  the  opportunity  to  play  active  and interactive roles in storytelling (Namulundah 2011).

Research draws attention to the different values and benefits of storytelling. Storytelling is not always a mere presentation but is  acknowledged  as  a  living  art,  as  the  storyteller  uses  words, sounds, songs, language patterns, hands and facial expressions (Anderson 2005). Stories could also contribute to recording and expressing feelings, attitudes and lived experiences (Tuwe 2016), which lead to a better understanding of the thoughts and feelings of others (Paul 2012). Therefore, stories also engage learners on a rational and emotional level (Sole &amp; Wilson 2002). Stories can be used as a communication tool through which complex ideas can be presented in a simple, more memorable form. In other words, stories and storytelling can be a vehicle to teach and learn new  content.  Thus,  learning  with  stories  enables  learners  to understand, recall and remember  the learning content in meaningful and relevant ways (Scholtz 2003).

Imagination is central to storytelling activities (Agbenyegaa, Tamakloeb  &amp;  Klibthongc  2017).  In  this  regard,  Huff  (2000) considers  puppets  as  multisensory  tools  in  storytelling,  which stimulate  imagination  and  encourage  creativity,  through  which learners'  reading  and  listening  experience  could  be  enriched. Vygotsky (2004) indicates that, during storytelling, children can imagine the characters they cannot see, can conceptualise what they hear from storytellers and can think about what they have not  yet  experienced.  Denning  (2000)  suggests  that  stories provide the ability to communicate naturally, clearly and truthfully, while Swap et al. (2001) point out that stories stimulate interaction.

Another benefit of stories is that stories provide an effective means of sharing knowledge about different cultures, language and  traditions.  Within  the  South  African  context,  sharing  of

stories  is  an  ideal  way  of  both  affirming  cultural  diversity  and discovering our common humanity (Tobin &amp; Snyman 2007).

The  function of storytelling has been  identified as the mediation and transmission of knowledge and information across generations (Chinyowa 2004), which include voice and gestures, and can be linked in the modern world with puppetry, which can engage learners as Homo ludens (Huizinga 1955), which in turn fosters a PoP and provides teachers with the scope to be creative and artistic in their teaching.

## Puppetry as a teaching methodology

Storytelling has a rich tradition and is considered as one of the original teaching forms (Liang et al. 2017). Storytelling is central in puppetry, and De Beer, Petersen and Brits (2018) explored the epistemological border-crossing, using puppets to infuse art and drama into the classroom. Puppets can be used effectively as a pedagogical  tool  in  education.  Tzuriel  and  Ronit  (2018)  argue that  puppets  can  be  used  efficiently  for  learners  with  special needs, as teaching with puppets elicits a higher level of mediation strategies than teaching without a puppet. In nursing education, Tilbrook et al. (2017) reported that puppets were used successfully in acute care paediatrics, while Reid-Searl et al. (2017) described the use of puppetry for play therapy. Pearce and Hardiman (2012) illustrated that puppetry can also be used at the tertiary level by using the method of 'Hot Seating through Puppetry'. This method promoted engagement among business students; puppets were used to challenge students to explore and discuss contemporary marketing issues, including controversial products and ethics.

At  the  school  level,  puppets  were  used  in  subjects  such  as Biology  (Life  Sciences),  Natural  Sciences  and  Mathematics. Keogh and Naylor (2008) described how puppets were used in Mathematics lessons to provoke dialogue and discussion. Belohlawek, Keogh and Naylor (2010) used the Talk in Science project, which focussed on using puppets, to engage children in conversation to develop their thinking about scientific concepts

in an inquiring, explorative approach. This project motivated and engaged teachers to link literacy with science in their teaching and learning practices. Borota et al. (2007) also highlighted the importance of learners making their own puppets.

Puppets  could  be  used  to  establish  a  less  intimidating communication space, as they are non-dangerous mediators that can compare, compete and participate in dialogues (Borota et al. 2007).  Puppets  are  therefore  considered  as  non-judgemental and thus become confidants of children who might find it difficult to express themselves (Tubbs 1993).

Addressing  the  affective  domain  through  puppetry  as  a teaching methodology could provide a safe space for learners to address emotional and controversial issues. According to Serame et  al.  (2013),  the  best  word  to  describe  this  safe  space  is  the German word geborgenheit (which can roughly be translated as a feeling  of  security).  According  to  them, geborgenheit is particularly important in the teaching and learning environment to ensure that learners feel mentally and physically safe. Instituting puppets to enhance the affective domain in a subject introduces a creative element into teaching (Lin 2014). Research conducted by  Sellman  (2015)  indicates  that  an  environment  of  trust  is created  by  bringing  artists  into  traditional  education  contexts. This provided a safe space for learners where they could share their ideas and develop their own skills and critical thinking.

## Self-directed learning

Both  puppetry  and  the  infusion  of  IK  can  enhance  SDL  in learners.  De  Beer  et  al.  (2018)  describe  how  puppetry  can  be used in the Life Sciences classroom to facilitate the epistemology border-crossing  between  Western  science  and  IK  using  CL techniques. Both PBL and CL - if implemented wisely - could enhance SDL (Barrows 1996; Garrison 1997), as it is expected of learners  that  they  evaluate  the  process  and  outcomes  of  their own learning by setting their own learning goals and identifying their  own  resources  to  accomplish  their  goals  (Knowles  1975).

Douglass  and  Morris  (2014)  iterate  the  tenets  of  SDL  in  their research in that they indicate that learners should take ownership of their own learning so that they experience a sense of autonomy when  they  succeed.  These  authors  also  indicate  that  intrinsic motivation is very important in the SDL process.

Using these elements identified by Knowles (1975) in SDL as a process, De Beer and Mentz (2017) indicated various practices from IK holders that can be regarded as SDL, for example, the use  of  medicinal  plants  in  the  Khoi-san  community.  It  was mentioned earlier that the use of medicinal plants can be infused into  the  Life  Sciences  curriculum,  and  this  topic  was  also addressed during this particular research. The Khoi-san community demonstrate SDL, according to De Beer and Mentz (2017). They showed evidence of taking responsibility for their own  learning  in  solving  authentic  problems  (e.g.  identifying suitable plants which can cure a specific illness) - for instance, Sutherlandia frutescens (cancer bush) was used to treat diabetes, high blood pressure, stomach problems and common cold (De Beer 2012). The Khoi-san community were able to expand their knowledge  as  they  later  also  used Sutherlandia  frutescens to treat AIDS (De Beer 2012). De Beer and Van Wyk (2011) developed an ethnobotanical index to determine the ethnobotanical knowledge  of  the  Khoi-san  in  different  age  categories.  Their research showed that young people were able to identify edible plants and were able to harvest them sustainably. Furthermore, older people were also able to identify plants to treat different illnesses. De Beer and Mentz (2017) are of the opinion that the Khoi-san community were able to identify plants according to their own needs, which changed as they became older (refer to Ch. 3).

De Beer and Mentz (2017) used the data of the EKI and claimed that PBL among the Khoi-san people were needs-based. The use of medicinal plants by the Khoi-san is linked to solving authentic problems.  Barrows  (1996)  showed  that  PBL  has  the  potential to  enhance SDL. De Beer and Mentz (2017) indicated that the Khoi-san  community  were  responsible  for  their  own  learning.

As  soon  as  a  need  arises,  for  instance,  hunger  or  an  illness, members of the community must be able to identify their own learning needs (which plants are appropriate?), identify suitable resources  (which  plants  can  be  used  to  address  their  hunger pangs or cure an illness?) and, lastly, identify strategies to harvest the plants and evaluate if the plants are suitable to suppress their hunger or cure an illness (refer to Ch. 3).

This  chapter  therefore  showcases  research  conducted  with student  teachers  on  infusing  IK  into  their  classrooms  using storytelling by means of puppetry, in an attempt to enhance SDL in the classroom. Specific curricula topics are suitable to infuse IK, and student teachers were sensitised to utilise such opportunities.

## Research questions and research methodology

## A qualitative research design

This research focussed on student teachers completing a subject methodology course in either Life Sciences or Physical Sciences (both  subjects  at  the  FET  level)  and  Social  Sciences  (which targeted  the  Senior  and  Intermediate  Phases).  This  research initially focussed on Life Sciences student teachers and was later expanded  to  include  student  teachers  specialising  in  Physical Sciences and Social Sciences as well.

The chapter reports on the perceptions of student teachers on the use of puppetry as a vehicle to portray IK storytelling. The following questions directed the research:

- · What are the perceptions of student teachers on the use of puppets within their teaching methodologies?
- · How can IK be infused into the curriculum by using puppetry?

This research followed a qualitative design, and a convenience sampling method was used as data were obtained from student teachers  during  a  normal  class  period.  Ethical  considerations were taken into account, and ethics approval was obtained from

the university. An independent person (colleague) explained the research  to  the  student  teachers,  after  which  they  willingly completed  the  consent  forms.  Student  teachers  were  also informed  that  participating  in  the  research  was  voluntary,  but they still had to participate in the class activities, as they formed part  of  the  normal  module  outcomes.  Only  student  teachers willing  to  participate  in  the  research  completed  the  pre-  and post-questionnaires as well as the reflective notes.

Student teachers in both the Life Sciences and Physical Sciences methodology  modules  first  completed  the  pre-questionnaire  on infusing IK and puppetry into a lesson. Thereafter, a short Power Point presentation was used to facilitate a discussion on IK and how puppetry can be used as pedagogy in this regard. The Life Sciences presentation  focussed  on  the  usage  of  indigenous  plants  as medicine,  while  Physical  Sciences  focussed  on  indigenous  beermaking  techniques (anaerobic respiration and  the chemistry involved).  Both  groups  then  watched  a  short  puppet  show.  In addition,  the  Physical  Sciences  group  performed  an  experiment that simulated African beer-brewing [ Umqombothi ].

In Social Sciences, student teachers initially watched a video of a puppet show. The value and use of puppets as a teaching methodology in Social Sciences were then discussed. This was followed by a discussion on which CAPS topics (DBE 2011c) in Social Sciences are suitable to infuse IK into the curriculum.

Both  Physical  Sciences  and  Life  Sciences  student  teachers discussed - using the De Bono's thinking hats (De Bono 2016) technique - the feasibility of using puppets in their classrooms to introduce concepts of IK. Using this technique as a CL strategy enabled the student teachers to discuss the topic from different perspectives.

Student teachers in Physical Sciences and Life Sciences then completed a post-questionnaire in the classroom to determine whether  their  perceptions  had  changed  with  regard  to  using puppetry  to  infuse  IK  into  their  lessons.  Student  teachers  in Social  Sciences  only  completed  one  questionnaire  (after  the

development of scripts and the puppet shows) to establish their perceptions of using puppetry as methodology to infuse IK into a Social Sciences classroom.

Lastly, the Life Sciences and Social Sciences student teachers planned  and  presented  puppet  shows  specifically  for  their subjects.  This  placed  a  high  premium  on  SDL.  Life  Sciences student  teachers  focussed  on  indigenous  plants,  while  those in  Social  Sciences  concentrated on the diversity and heterogeneity of the South African people. Student teachers had to write their own scripts, make their puppets and then have a puppet show, which  was  videotaped.  Student  teachers  were  asked  to  write reflective  notes  about  the  feasibility  of  using  puppets  in  their classrooms.

Data gathered from student teachers' completed questionnaires, discussions using De Bono's thinking hats, reflective notes and data scripts of puppet shows were individually transcribed and coded for the  three  different  subjects.  Codes  were  then  arranged  into emerging themes (Saldaña 2013).

## Research lens: Third-generation CulturalHistorical Activity Theory

This  research  used  the  third-generation  CHAT  as  the  research lens to analyse the data (Engeström 1987) (refer to Ch. 2 for a detailed  description  of  using  CHAT  as  a  research  lens).  In  this research,  CHAT  was  used  on  a  systemic,  institutional  plane (Mentz &amp; De Beer 2017) where the subject is a system rather than a person. This is illustrated in Figure 9.1.

Engeström  (2001)  indicates  that  two  interrelating  activity systems allow  the  researcher  to  study  various  perspectives  as well as the interaction between the two activity systems. In this research, activity system 1 refers to the Western outlook on the curriculum, while activity system 2 focuses on the oral tradition of IK and its use of 'tools' such as drama, storytelling and puppetry in the classroom. One of the underlying principles of an activity

system is to identify underlying tensions (Engeström 2001) that can influence the achievement of the object. These 'tensions' can either be potential conflicts within the system or it can identify innovation and improvement within the activity system, which is necessary  for  growth  and  development  within  the  system. Breidlid  (2013)  is  of  the  opinion  that,  by  using  CHAT  as  the research lens, the multifaceted interactions between IK (and the traditional tools such as storytelling and puppetry) and a Western outlook on the science curriculum can be researched. Processes that  can  contribute  to  changes  both  at  the  institutional  and individual level, which can lead to transformation, can be studied and analysed using CHAT (Breidlid 2013).

This research highlights the contradiction of control (McNeil 2013) when comparing the Western outlook on the curriculum with the oral tradition of IK. Student teachers engage with CAPS (2011a,  2011b,  2011c)  in  their  respective  subjects,  but  these documents  do  not  explicitly  indicate  how  to  infuse  IK  into

their  subjects.  By  introducing  puppetry and storytelling to the student  teachers  as  teaching  methodology,  it  addressed  the objective of this research to facilitate the dual border-crossing between Western knowledge and IK (Cronje 2015) and between arts and science (Petersen &amp; White 2018).

## Activity system 1

The subject of this activity system is the Western perspective of the curriculum, which is governed (the rules) by CAPS (DBE 2011a, 2011b, 2011c) in the South African context. Rigid time frames known as pace-setters are provided, which must be followed in order to complete the curriculum in time. In order to adhere to the rigid time frames of the curriculum and policy documents, transmissionmode teaching (e.g. lectures) is often used as a tool. Ramnarain and  Schuster  (2014)  have  shown  that  teachers,  especially  in previously disadvantaged schools in South Africa, predominantly use 'chalk-and-talk'  approaches  owing  to  the  pressure  on  them from school management and parents that children perform well in summative assessment opportunities. Student teachers (the participants in this research) were all learners in such teachers' classrooms (see the notion of the 'apprenticeship of observation' in the next paragraph), and therefore, they tend to use the same tools during their school experience.

Student teachers and the lecturer form part of the community where  the  student  teachers  are  introduced  to  a  variety  of methodology  practices.  Student  teachers  were  all  part  of  a school system and had the preconception that they were familiar with teaching. This is known in education as the 'apprenticeship of observation', a term coined by Lortie (1975). These student teachers  therefore  come  with  at  least  12  years  of  'baggage' into their teacher education, and it is extremely difficult to assist them in breaking the cycle of transmission-mode teaching. This is also of particular importance in the context of this research on puppetry, as few students were exposed to such pedagogies in school.

The division of roles (labour) concerns the student teachers who alternate their roles between that of a student and a teacher. On the one hand, they take on the role of a student when they receive tutoring to become teachers, and on the other hand, they switch roles  to  that  of  a  teacher  when  they  have  to  develop  activities they  can  use  in  their  future  classrooms.  The  prescribed  course introduced student teachers to the different roles of a teacher, such as the teacher as a reflective practitioner (Gravett &amp; De Beer 2016), the teacher as a facilitator of learning (De Beer &amp; Gravett 2016) and the teacher as an interpreter of the curriculum (Du Plessis 2016).

## Activity system 2

Activity system 2 included elements of activity system 1 as CAPS still govern the activity system. In activity system 2, the oral tradition of IK (subject) is infused into the teacher training curriculum, which expands the object of the activity system to a more comprehensive curriculum  as  IK  can  contextualise  the  content  for  the  learners (in this case, the student teachers) (Breidlid 2013).

To expand the curriculum, tools used in this activity system included  drama  and  storytelling.  Introducing  these  tools  can address the metaphysical aspects of IK, as puppets were used to convey  IK  stories.  Ogunniyi  (2011)  is  of  the  opinion  that  the worldview  of  teachers  (and  in  this  instance,  student  teachers) should  be  expanded  to  include  other  worldviews  such  as  IK, which should be infused into their classrooms.

Student  teachers  and  their  lecturer  still  formed  part  of  the community in this activity system, but the division of labour now broadened to include the teacher as an artist (Graham &amp; Rees 2014), which included creative pedagogy in the classroom in this activity system.

## Findings and discussion

As CHAT is a barometer of tensions, the following tensions were evident in the two activity systems. These tensions are discussed

under the following four themes. As the same themes emerged when analysing the data from student teachers for Life Sciences, Physical  Sciences  and  Social  Sciences,  the  discussion  includes the  findings  of  all  the  students,  and  no  distinction  is  made between feedback of students of the different subjects.

The  first  two  themes  indicated  that  student  teachers  were unable to use puppetry to facilitate  border-crossings  between science and IK as well as between arts and science.

## Many student teachers were of the opinion that puppetry and storytelling is an inappropriate pedagogy for high school learners

Many student teachers indicated that puppetry is an inappropriate pedagogy  for  high  school  learners.  Perceptions  of  student teachers  were  that  introducing  puppets  in  a  classroom  might lead  to  disruptions  in  class  as  learners  might  make  jokes  and regard puppets to be childish, which is evident from the following quote by a student teacher:

Puppetry is not something that can be taken seriously by anyone above the age of 10 years let alone high school students. If there is  anything a teacher can focus on, it should be technology in the classroom,  but  using  puppets  sounds  quite  insane  to  be  honest. (Student teacher, undisclosed gender, date unknown)

This indicates a tension within the division of roles and between the  'division  of  labour'  and  the  'object'.  Student  teachers  still saw their  role  as  teachers  from  the  observations  of  their  own teachers - the 'apprenticeship of observation' as described earlier (Lortie 1975). Student teachers were used to the transmissionmode of teaching (Ramnarain &amp; Schuster 2014) and were not exposed to puppetry, which might be an unfamiliar concept to them.  This  was  emphasised  by  another  student  teacher  who said, 'some learners will not adapt to the use of puppets in the classroom as they are used to pen and paper and chalk board' (student teacher, undisclosed gender, date unknown).

Tensions between the tools and object were identified. Some student  teachers  believed  incorporating  puppetry  into  their teaching methodology will distract their learners from the actual content of the lesson, as one student teacher indicated 'learners will  look  more  at  the  puppet  than  paying  attention'  (student teacher,  undisclosed  gender,  date  unknown).  Another  student believed  that  'when  there  is  an  incorporation  of  fun  in  the classroom,  learners  get  carried  away  and  their  focus  shift' (student teacher, undisclosed gender, date unknown). Puppetry was viewed as an inappropriate methodology in the exam-driven education  system,  saying  'I  do  not  think  it's  appropriate  for  a class of 30 learners which almost write record exams' (student teacher, undisclosed gender, date unknown).

Although  student  teachers  believed  puppets  might  be  a distraction  in  class,  Belohlawek  et  al.  (2010)  indicated  that puppets can be successfully used to support learners to develop scientific concepts. In this regard, one student teacher believed that, although puppets might be a distraction in class, they might also support the learners to focus on the subject content. This student teacher indicated:

So, this puppets [ sic ] won't distract just them (the learners) in a good way, but also help them interpret what is being taught, therefore they won't even realise that their being distracted in such a way they are actually focussing on what's important. (Student teacher, undisclosed gender, date unknown)

The  CHAT  diagram  indicated  the  contradiction  of  control (McNeil 2013) between the two activity systems. Puppetry can be  used  to  facilitate  the  border-crossing  between  a  Western perspective on the curriculum and the oral traditions within IK. Some  student  teachers  were  unable  to  make  this  bordercrossing,  which  indicates  a  tension  between  the  two  activity systems. These student teachers viewed the tenets of NOS in Life Sciences and Physical Sciences as more empirical in nature; '[i]t [using puppets] does not fit in with science', and 'it [using puppets] really does not concern the nature of science' (student teacher, undisclosed gender, date unknown). Another student

teacher indicated, 'you should physically conduct experiments' (student  teacher,  undisclosed  gender,  date  unknown).  This finding is in line with the research of Adedoyin and Bello (2017), which indicated that student teachers have misconceptions on what the NOS entails. However, puppetry can encapsulate the metaphors that De Beer and Van Wyk refer to in Chapter 4 and, in so doing, address this contradiction of control.

Student teachers were mostly of the opinion that puppetry as  a  methodology  is  more  suitable  in  the  lower  grades  of schooling, 'but I do not believe it will be as effective with high school students. Puppetry can be a very constructive teachingand-learning method with younger learners' (student teacher, undisclosed  gender,  date  unknown).  Some  student  teachers also experienced  puppetry  as  an  add-on  and  could  not comprehend how puppets can be used in the classroom itself; 'in Physical Sciences, there is a lot of work to do in a year and learners  do  sport  (extramural  activities),  teachers  cannot waste time on concerts' (student teacher, undisclosed gender,  date  unknown).  Another  student  commented,  'I  am against puppetry. Learners will choose drama as a subject if they want to do it' (student teacher, undisclosed gender, date unknown).

Lastly,  tensions  were  also  identified  in  the  role  division  of teachers under  this theme.  If puppetry  is introduced as pedagogy, the teacher would have to incorporate creative and inventive elements within their methodology that might embarrass  him  or  her;  'I  do  not  like  puppetry,  so  even  if  it's possibly a good way I will not feel comfortable as a teacher' (student teacher, undisclosed gender, date unknown), and 'to be laughed out by students and respect will be lost including self-respect' (student teacher, undisclosed gender, date unknown). It is clear that student teachers struggled to accept the role of the teacher as an artist.

Although  authors  such  as  Keogh  and  Naylor  (2008)  and De Beer et al. (2018) indicated that puppetry as pedagogy has

merits  as  a  teaching  methodology,  it  is  evident  from  the discussions of the student teachers that they did not realise the importance of introducing a creative element into teaching to address the affective domain, as indicated by Lin (2014).

## Student teachers were of the opinion that puppetry and storytelling is a time-intensive pedagogy

Tensions were evident between the rules and the object in the activity  systems.  Student  teachers  sensed  that  encompassing puppetry as teaching methodology might not fit the rigid time frames prescribed in the CAPS document. One student was of the opinion that, '[i]t could pose as an extremely time-consuming activity, thus other work could be neglected, or rushed'.

Student teachers realised that it would initially take more work from the teacher, which indicated a tension within the role division of a teacher. The teacher would have to move away from being only a facilitator of learning to that of the teacher as an artist:

It takes a lot of hard work to actually be both the teacher and puppet at once as you have to not just focus on the classroom; you must focus on your puppet as well. It can be tricky sometimes as you as teacher don't want to lose focus of the children but in the same time try  to  entertain  them.  (Student  teacher,  undisclosed  gender,  date unknown)

It is interesting to note this teacher-centred perspective. It might be a far better approach to ask the learners to write a relevant puppet  script  for  particular  content  and  be  the  puppeteers themselves. Student teachers also realised that thorough research must  be  conducted  before  introducing puppetry  into the curriculum, which focuses on the role of the teacher as curriculum interpreter:

At  high  school  level,  careful  selection  must  be  made  where  the strategy (puppetry) is used, to work well. A proposal would be to use puppetry only at ethical/controversial topics. (Student teacher, undisclosed gender, date unknown)

## Some student teachers highlighted puppetry and storytelling as creative pedagogies, addressing the affective domain

Some of the student teachers were more optimistic and were willing to make the epistemological border-crossing to implement puppetry as pedagogy in their future classrooms:

Yes, because it was interesting and a new way to have class. I would like  to  implement  this  in  my  classroom  one  day.  It  was  fun  and different, and I think this could be a creative way to explain concepts. (Student teacher, undisclosed gender, date unknown)

A positive tension was evident between the two activity systems, as student teachers realised that puppetry could bring the fun element into teaching, which would provide a more meaningful teaching and learning experience:

Puppetry brings a positive atmosphere in class because of fun being integrated. A positive attitude towards the subject is being developed which leads to a better participation of learners. (Student teacher, undisclosed gender, date unknown)

Here student teachers realised that puppetry as a 'tool' can enhance the achievement of the 'object'. Although some student teachers initially thought that puppetry as pedagogy is not suited for high school learners, they came up with solutions during their discussion using the De Bono's Hats strategy. They proposed that learners can use masks and do a role play instead of using puppets. Another solution was that learners at school level write their own scripts and produce their own puppet shows. This indicated a positive tension within the tools and object of the second activity system.

Student teachers believed that writing their own scripts could enhance creativity and critical thinking:

When students write plays, foremost in many of their minds is [ sic ] how they will look, how they will sound, and how others will respond to them. Writing for the puppet allows them to be far more silly [ sic ], as  well  as  take  risks  with  accents,  characters,  and  plots  that  they wouldn't try if they were required to act it out live. Not only does

it help them learn the content as well as writing skills and dialogue formatting,  but  they  also  learn  important  lessons  in  collaboration, communication,  critical  thinking,  and  creativity.  (Student  teacher, undisclosed gender, date unknown)

Research  indicated  that  there  is  a  link  between  emotion  and cognitive  functions  (refer  to  Ch.  4).  This  link  could  stimulate creativity (Immordino-Yang &amp; Damasio 2007). After writing their own puppet scripts, making their own puppets and performing puppet shows, both Life Sciences students and Social Sciences students reported that they had enjoyed the activity. Examples of puppet shows from Life Sciences student teachers included a family visiting a botanical garden where they identified indigenous plants  that  have  healing  powers.  Another  group  developed  a script where an isiZulu-speaking lady and an Afrikaans-speaking lady  exchanged  remedies  from  their  respective  cultures  for asthma.  Examples  of  Social  Sciences  puppet  shows  included History curriculum themes. One group of student teachers used the history of the settlers coming to the Cape (De Villiers 2014) to develop their script. Their dialogue was between a new settler and a Khoi-san person. The settler wanted to clear a piece of land for his garden and the Khoi-san alerted the settler that he would end  up  destroying  plants  used  for  medicinal  purposes  by  the Khoi-san. In another example, the script described the cultural differences between a settler and the Xhosa on the then eastern border between the Xhosa and settlers from the Cape.

## Student teachers demonstrated the affordances of puppetry for the enhancement of self-directed learning

Self-directed learning was evident when  student teachers completed  the  assignments  on  the  puppet  shows.  Student teachers had to identify suitable topics in the CAPS document that  were  appropriate  for  the  inclusion  of  IK  and  the  use  of puppets. They had to write their own scripts, thereby engaging with relevant learning material and developing their own learning resources (the puppets). This indicates a positive tension between

the two activity systems, as student teachers were able to use puppetry as pedagogy to facilitate the border-crossing between the Western curriculum and IK.

## Conclusion

This research showed that there was a slight resistance from some student teachers to accept and engage with puppetry, as it was seen as inappropriate in higher grades. This speaks of 12 years of transmission-mode teaching and learning that they experienced as learners  (Ramnarain  &amp;  Schuster  2014)  and  resistance  to  change (Lukacs &amp; Galluzzo 2014). Lukacs and Gallyzzo (2014) point out that, to implement  change,  teachers  should  have  contextual expertise,  should  be  able  to  solve  problems  and  should  take

ownership  for  the  change.  Watt  and  Pascoe  (2013)  are  of  the opinion that Work-integrated Learning (WIL) is essential to prepare student teachers for their world of work. Although student teachers obtain  experiences  with  different  teaching  strategies,  such  as puppetry,  they  sometimes  use  transmission-mode  teaching,  as indicated  by  Ramnarain  and  Schuster  (2014),  during  their  WIL period  and  therefore  might  not  see  the  need  to  implement methodologies such as puppetry and storytelling in future in their classrooms. A positive stance was, however, taken by some students who saw the potential of introducing puppetry and storytelling into their classrooms through thorough planning, and they were quite willing to implement this teaching methodology during their WIL period and in their classrooms in future.

Although  workshops  are  held on puppetry, which  target (in-service)  teachers  as  well,  this  work  on  puppetry  should  be expanded so that more teachers are aware of alternative modes. De  Beer  et  al.  (2018)  have  indicated  that  puppetry  can  be successfully implemented in the Biology (Life Sciences) classroom. Using  puppetry  and  storytelling  in  the  classroom  could  address the  affective  domain,  which  stimulates  cognitive  thinking  and creativity (Immordino-Yang &amp; Damasio 2007).

## Summary

This research explored the perceptions of student teachers in Life Sciences, Physical Sciences and Social Sciences regarding the  use  of  puppetry  in  a  classroom  to  infuse  IK  into  their respective  curricula.  As  IK  relies  on  an  oral  tradition  and content is transferred by means of storytelling, puppets could be  a  vehicle  in  a  classroom  to  convey  knowledge  through stories.

Literature indicates that stories can be an effective pedagogy in the classroom and that puppetry can be used successfully in an educational context. In this research, storytelling and puppetry were  combined  to  infuse  IK  into  the  'Westernised'  curriculum, using an SDL approach.

## The two guiding research questions were:

- 1. What are the perceptions of student teachers on the use of puppets within their teaching methodologies?
- 2.  How can IK be infused into the curriculum through puppetry as pedagogy?

The research followed a basic qualitative design, and data were collected  by  means  of  questionnaires,  reflective  notes  and analysis of class discussions where De Bono's Hats were used as the teaching methodology.

The findings reveal that some student teachers believed that puppetry might be an inappropriate pedagogy for older learners and should exclusively focus on primary school learners. Student teachers also indicated that puppetry and storytelling are timeintensive pedagogies but that it might be feasible through careful planning. Some student teachers highlighted the affordances of storytelling and puppetry as creative pedagogies and felt that it would address the affective domain in learning. Therefore, the findings indicated that some student teachers were unable, or found it  difficult,  to  make  the  epistemological  border-crossing between the methods employed in the Western curriculum and pedagogies such as puppetry, which are well aligned with IK.

Lastly, SDL was evident when the student teachers prepared their scripts and held their puppet shows. As they could identify their  own  learning  needs,  they  had  to  engage  in  independent learning on the complexities of writing puppet scripts and were able to evaluate their own progress.

## Introduction

This chapter deals with the intersections of technology and IK systems  within  the  context  of  facilitating  SDL.  An  overview  is provided  of  relevant  theoretical  concepts  of  SDL,  technology and IK systems as well as an interpretation of these issues in the South African CAPS at the school level. The empirical part of this chapter  involves  a  critical  literature  review  with  a  focus  on operationalising aspects of learning and teaching in IK systems through  technology.  In  conclusion,  technological  interventions for IK in teaching practice are suggested.

## Theoretical framework

This chapter on the affordances of technology for teaching IK is  rooted  in  literature  on  SDL.  The  theoretical  framework  for this research functions in a nexus with SDL as well as technology and IK. It is, nevertheless, important to consider that technology is  not  exclusively  a  Western  concept,  and  Shizha  (2016:47) notes  that  African  IT  was  created  from  scientific  knowledge from the continent which has had practical use. In this chapter, the focus is on the adoption of different learning technologies towards the teaching of IK. The subsequent sections enumerate the definitions and the relevant theoretical aspects from the prevalent  discourses  in  terms  of  SDL,  technology  and  IK systems.

## Self-directed learning

The concept of SDL informs the way in which learning and the wider learning context is viewed in this chapter. Knowles (1975) defines SDL as:

[ A ] process in which individuals take the initiative, with or without the  help  of  others,  in  diagnosing  their  learning  needs,  formulating learning goals, identifying human and material resources for learning, choosing  and  implementing  appropriate  learning  strategies  and evaluating learning outcomes. (p. 18)

Similarly, Gibbons (2002) defines SDL as:

[ A ]ny  increase  in  knowledge,  skill,  accomplishment,  or  personal development that an individual selects and brings about by his or her own efforts using any method in any circumstances at any time. (p. 2)

However,  many  and  varied  definitions  exist  for  SDL  (Bailey 2016:77; Leach 2000:10; Van Zyl 2016:28-29). This section covers what  the  concept  of  SDL  involves,  and  how  it  is  approached, operationalised and used in terms of technology.

The concept of SDL has been clearly delineated by Knowles (1975), Guglielmino (1978), Brockett and Hiemstra (1991), Candy (1991), Garrison (1997), Leach (2000), Merriam (2001), Gibbons (2002), Bolhuis (2003) and Nikitenko (2009), among others. In the South African context, there has also been several significant publications  and  postgraduate  studies  on  SDL  with  regard  to various strategies and disciplines (Bailey 2016; Bosch 2017; Breed 2016; Du Toit-Brits 2018; Mentz &amp; Oosthuizen 2016; Tredoux 2012; Van Zyl 2016).

It is also imperative to consider the reason why SDL is relevant and how it can be approached. According to Merriam (2001:9), SDL denotes three goals, namely, 'development of the learner's capacity to be self-directed', 'the fostering of transformational learning' and 'the promotion of emancipatory learning and social action'. Different models of SDL have also been identified (Garrison 1997; Tredoux 2012:14-30; Van Zyl 2016:32-35). Bullock (2013:107) notes that SDL can be approached in terms of being a 'linear, stepwise process' or as being a more interactive process. From the literature, the link between  SDL  and  self-regulated  learning  is  evident,  and  in  this research, self-regulated learning is regarded as being part of the overarching concept of SDL (cf. Tredoux 2012:10-11).

Self-directed learning should also be contextualised in terms of  the  specific  circumstances  in  which  learning  occurs.  In  this regard, Bolhuis (2003:329-330) emphasises the importance of 'domain-specificness' and 'situatedness' of learning, and Bullock (2013:107)  also  refers  to  the  importance  of  'variety  of  factors, internal  and  external  to  the  learner'.  An  increase  in  the  use  of

technology in the wider educational context as well as contextualisation  through  the  inclusion  of  IK  systems  is  highly relevant. Furthermore, the potential of IK for SDL is clear from the explication by De Beer (2016:47-48).

Towards  the  operationalisation  of  SDL,  Bolhuis  (2003:343) suggests a 'multidimensional approach to learning' and a processoriented teaching involving 'helping students to gradually acquire the competences  to  regulate all components  in  learning'; 'stimulating  the  knowledge-building  process  necessary  to  gain domain expertise';  'attention  to  emotional  aspects  of  learning, including fostering motivation and a positive pattern of attribution, as well as helping students to enlarge their tolerance of uncertainty'; and that 'schools and teachers need to treat the learning process and results as social phenomena'. The phenomenon  of  SDL  can  also  be  measured  by  means  of instruments such as the Self-Directed Learning Readiness Scale (Guglielmino  1978)  and  the  Self-Rating  Scale  of  Self-Directed Learning (Williamson 2007), for example.

The  benefits  of  digital  technologies  in  supporting  SDL  are evident  from  literature  (Bullock  2013:117;  Du  Toit  &amp;  Pool  2016; Fleming, Artis &amp; Hawes 2014; Kim et al. 2014; Nikitenko 2009; Tredoux 2012). In addition, the implications of SDL for machine learning have also been investigated (Gureckis &amp; Markant 2012). Importantly, Du Toit and Pool (2016:214) even assert that 'selfdirected  learning  is  a  crucial  competence  for  students  in  a blended-learning  course'.  Therefore,  the  symbiotic  relationship between SDL and technology is evident.

## Technology in learning and teaching

In this chapter, the concept of technology is understood as the use of computer- and Internet-based resources within a learning and teaching setting. This definition is opposite to a more general definition  of  technology,  which  could  be  more  'multifaceted' (Shizha  2016:49).  The  approach  to  technology  in  this  chapter relates to Clark and Mayer's (2016:7) definition of e-learning as

'instruction  delivered  on  a  digital  device  that  is  intended  to support learning', and this learning context includes multimedia (Mayer 2017). Duval, Sharples and Sutherland (2017:1) emphasise the fact that digital technology, versus other technologies, tends to be more interactive. Crook and Sutherland (2017) acknowledge the influence of learning theories from behaviourism, cognitivism, constructivism and social constructivism. Technology in learning and  teaching  can  support  collaboration  and  personalisation. Furthermore,  in  order  to  approach  technology  within  a  wider context of IK systems, it is essential to consider the manner in which technology is integrated within the learning and teaching context as well as the effects of the digital divide on the usage of technology.

Technology allows for interaction, and therefore, it supports interdependence and collaboration. Moreover, Guglielmino and Guglielmino  (2001:39)  opine  that  learning  should  essentially occur in an interdependent rather than a dependent way. Similarly, Brewer (2016:37) also underscores the apparent interdependent nature of the SDL process. This aspect of learning technology links  up  with  the  traditional  collaborative  nature  of  knowledge generation  within  the  African  context.  According  to  Shizha (2016:53),  '[i]n  pre-colonial  Africa,  the  learning  of  skills  in  the production of knowledge and tools for socio-economic development was a community activity based on the concept of Ubuntu'. Therefore, the capabilities of learning technology should also  be  exploited  in  terms  of  facilitating  technology-based Ubuntu, and what Shizha refers to as 'communality', with the aim of supporting SDL.

In addition, technology  also  supports  personalisation  of learning. Klašnja-Milićević et al. (2017) observe how '[s]emantic Web technologies, ontologies and adaptation rules can be used to  improve  the  performance'  of  personalised  systems.  In  this regard, Kim et al. (2014) also observed how a personalised system supports SDL. Du Toit and Pool (2016:236) remarked, regarding a blended  learning  environment  and  SDL,  that  'blended  courses should  purposely  include  skills  and  elements  required  in  SDL

such as time management,  reflection, communication  and collaboration  with  peers  -  especially  when  it  is  students'  first exposure to blended learning'. Therefore, self-direction needs to be considered throughout  the design and  implementation process when using any technology, whether it is in a blended or any other configuration.

However, it is important to note that, in terms of technology in a learning and teaching context, technology alone might not be sufficient to ensure effective learning. Colpaert (2014:20) notes  that  '[t]here  is  not  enough  evidence  to  suggest  that technology, or any other type of educational artefact, carries an inherent, measurable and generalizable effect on learning' and that the effect emanates from a learning environment that was designed appropriately. In this regard, Picciano (2009:16) proposes  a  'blending  with  purpose  multimodal  conceptual model for designing and developing blended learning courses and programs'. In this process, social, teaching, cognitive and learning presences must be considered (cf. Bosch &amp; Pool 2019). Yet,  all of  this  presupposes  being  able  to  have  and  use technology.

Access to technology cannot be assumed within the South African  context  and,  as  such,  the  so-called  digital  divide  is prevalent.  The  concept  of  the digital  divide , which  refers  to differences in access to the Internet, is ascribed to Lloyd Morrisett of the Markle Foundation (Hoffman, Novak &amp; Schlosser 2000). In South Africa, the digital divide can be associated with historical economic differences in terms of racial backgrounds (Hoadley 2017;  Nyahodza  &amp;  Higgs  2017).  Nonetheless,  Nyahodza  and Higgs (2017:46) remark that '[a]ccess to ICTs and informationrelated skills have been identified as key challenges in bridging the digital divide'. Bezuidenhout et al. (2017), however, note that having access to open data does not in itself bridge the digital divide and that individuals need to be empowered to use such resources.  Despite  their  focus  on  open  data,  the  implications of support  in access  to  technology  are  also  relevant  for technology  in  general.  In  this  regard,  Bezuidenhout  et  al.

(2017:473) note that 'by focussing on resource provision instead of resource utilization, inadvertently perpetuate marginalization, exclusion and 'data poverty''.

Regarding  IK,  it  is  important  to  take  note  of  the  fact  that e-learning  can  provide  affordances  in  terms  of  contextualising learning, as e-learning allows for customisation of learning where 'tailoring  content,  instructional  methods  and  navigation  based on  the  needs  of  individual  learners'  can  be  achieved  (Clark  &amp; Mayer 2016:15). In addition, the implications of augmented reality (Akçayır &amp; Akçayır 2017) also need further research considerations in terms  of  virtually  situating  learning.  Contextualisation  is important as, like Shizha (2016:50) states, '[t]echnology has to be appropriate to the community that it serves' and must also attend  to  the  needs  of  people.  Conversely,  Freire  (2005:60) states that 'the oppressors are using science and technology as unquestionably  powerful  instruments  for  their  purpose:  the maintenance of the oppressive order through manipulation and repression'. Furthermore, Freire (2005) observes:

The  inhumanity  of  the  oppressors  and  revolutionary  humanism both  make  use  of  science.  But  science  and  technology  at  the service of the former are used to reduce the oppressed to the status of  'things';  at  the  service  of  the  latter,  they  are  used  to  promote humanization. (p. 133)

Hence,  the  use  of  technology  has  an  important  role  to  play towards supporting further recognition of IK systems.

## Indigenous knowledge systems

The  need  for  IK  systems  within  a  South  African  and  a  wider African context is relevant owing to historical selective recognition of specific knowledge systems. In this regard, Murove (2018:160) remarks that in the past, 'knowledge systems of the colonizing powers,  imposed  themselves  on  the  colonised  as  the  only legitimate knowledge to the exclusion of the knowledge systems of  the  colonised'.  Furthermore, Shizha (2016:48) also observes that  '[p]ost-colonial  Africa  suffered  from  the  deskilling  and

disturbances in the course of development, heinously effected by colonial regimes'.

The  colonial  history  of  Africa  led  to  a  Eurocentric  focus  in education. Huaman and Brayboy (2017:3) note that 'education as the method of knowledge transfer (and validation) is rooted in  Eurocentrism  and  accepted  only  as  schooling,  despite  the myriad ways societies teach and learn'. However, they add that indigenous researchers have been challenging such definitions of knowledge with a colonial basis. Paulo Freire also questions who decides what knowledge is valid or not. Freire (2005:134) makes a statement in this context that 'the one who is doing the decreeing defines himself and the class to which he belongs as those who know or were born to, know; he thereby defines others as alien entities'.

As  with  the  transformation  agenda  in  higher  education,  an inclusion  of  IK  systems  could  imply  disruption.  With  regard  to transformation,  Waghid  (2018:10)  determined  how  educational technology  can  enhance  such  disruption  and  stated  that  the creation  of  'pedagogical  opportunities,  through  the  use  of educational  technologies,  may  mitigate  hierarchical  teacher student  interactions'  where  'students  have  the  equal  ability  to speak, to understand and to reshape an educational practice'. In addition,  the  role  of  indigenous  languages  together  with  IK  is emphasised by Shava and Manyike (2018).

Mkhize  et  al.  (2016:1)  state  that  'African  IK  systems  take  as their  point  of  departure  the  experiential  and  epistemological frameworks of the peoples of the African continent, and those of African  descent  globally'.  However,  they  also  note  that  this  IK system 'is part of international or world knowledge, the exception being  that  it  has  been  underdeveloped  or  marginalized,  as  a result of colonialism' (Mkhize et al. 2016:1). Furthermore, Shava and Manyike (2018:36) state that the 'accumulated knowledge that  indigenous  people  generate  is  embedded  in  their  culture and embodied in their practices' and is transmitted orally.

Within  the  context  of  South  African  classrooms,  there  has been a move to accommodate IK systems within Life Sciences (De Beer 2016; De Beer &amp; Van Wyk 2012; De Beer &amp; Whitlock 2009); Physics (Sithole 2016); Natural Sciences, Physical Sciences and  Mathematics  (De  Beer  2016); primary school science (Adyanga &amp; Romm 2016); History (Mvenene 2017); and science and  medical  teaching  (Hewson  2014),  among  others.  Through such  research,  there  has  been  a  move  towards  what  Murove (2018:174, 175) calls 'advocacy for an authentic knowledge that is rooted in context' and attempts towards 'the intellectualisation and production of local knowledges'.

Murove (2018:162) argues that 'the indigenisation of knowledge through the pursuit of IK systems intellectualisation and  knowledge  production  implies  that  authentic  knowledge should  be  culturally  contextual'.  Furthermore,  IK  should  be considered  within  specific  places  (Adyanga  &amp;  Romm  2016:11) and  be  regarded  as  open,  transforming  and  dynamic  systems (Shava &amp; Manyike 2018:37). Correspondingly, De Beer (2016:44) makes a case for 'the inclusion of indigenous knowledge through an embodied, situated and distributed cognition lens, rather than from a political perspective' within existing school subjects.

An  empirical  investigation  into  the  aforementioned  aspects was conducted by means of a critical literature review.

## Technology, indigenous knowledge and self-directed learning grounded in the policy documents

With regard to the grounding of IK and SDL in the South African context,  the  two  policy  documents  consulted  were  CAPS  and the  Professional  Development  Framework  for  Digital  Learning (PDFDL).

## The South African Curriculum and Assessment Policy Statement

When discussing the integration of IK, SDL and technologies into teaching and learning for teacher training institutions, in-service teachers  and  pre-service  teachers,  the  National  Curriculum Statement  (CAPS)  Grades  R-12  always  serves  as  the  point  of departure.

One of the main principles of CAPS Grades R-12 is valuing IK systems; 'acknowledging the rich history and heritage of South Africa as important contributors to nurturing the values contained in the Constitution' (Republic of South Africa 2011a:5). Furthermore,  as  part  of  the  general  aims  cutting  across  all subjects in the school curriculum, CAPS provides and encourages knowledge  and  skills  pertaining  to  SDL,  IK  and  technology integration. Thus, the five general aims include sufficient focus towards SDL, IK, technology integration, contexts and issues, and the first aim specifically proposes that (Republic of South Africa 2011a):

[ C ]hildren  acquire  and  apply  knowledge  and  skills  in  ways  that are  meaningful  to  their  own  lives.  In  this  regard,  the  curriculum promotes knowledge in local contexts, while being sensitive to global imperatives. (p. 5)

It is especially with this aim  that educators  should  seek opportunities within the class context to integrate IK.

In addition, the second aim specifically obliges to (Republic of South Africa 2011a):

[ E /thinspace ]quipping learners, irrespective of their socio-economic background, race, gender, physical ability or intellectual ability, with the  knowledge,  skills  and  values  necessary  for  self-fulfilment,  and meaningful participation in society as citizens of a free country. (p. 4)

And more so encouraging lifelong learning principles by 'facilitating the transition of learners from education institutions to the workplace' (Republic of South Africa 2011a:4).

It is also important to note that CAPS is based on the following principles that are relevant to IK, SDL and technology integration, among others (Republic of South Africa 2011a):

- · social transformation, whereby ensuring that the educational imbalances of the past are redressed and that equal educational opportunities are provided for all sections of the population
- · active  and  critical  learning  by  encouraging  an  active  and critical  approach  to  learning  with  high  knowledge  and  high skills  to  be  achieved at each grade setting, high, achievable standards in all subjects, also showing progression in content and context
- · a strong focus on human rights, inclusivity, environmental and social justice by infusing the principles and practices of social and environmental justice
- · valuing  IK  systems  by  acknowledging  the  rich  history  and heritage of this country as important contributors to nurturing the values contained in the Constitution. (p. 4)

This highlights the fact that social transformation, inclusivity and environmental justice are essential for the integration and valuing of IK in multicultural school contexts and that active and  critical  learning  is  fundamental  to  the  fostering  of  SDL skills.  But  the  most  important  value  of  the  CAPS,  regarding the combination of SDL, IK and technology integration, is that it  aims  to  create  learners  who  are  capable  to  (Republic  of South Africa 2011a):

[ ]dentify and solve problems and make decisions using critical and I creative  thinking,  work  effectively  as  individuals  and  with  others as members of a team; organise and manage themselves and their activities responsibly and effectively; collect, analyse, organise and critically evaluate information; communicate effectively using visual, symbolic and/or language skills in various modes; use science and technology effectively and critically showing responsibility towards the  environment  and  the  health  of  others; and  demonstrate  an understanding of the world as a set of related systems by recognising that  problem-solving  contexts  do  not  exist  in  isolation.  (pp.  4-5; [ emphasis in original ])

Lastly, the fifth general aim asks that (Republic of South Africa 2011a):

[ ]nclusivity should become a central part of the organisation, planning I and teaching at each school and can only happen if all teachers have a sound understanding of how to recognise and address barriers to learning, and how to plan for diversity, especially asking for proper training of pre-service teachers. (p. 4)

This is generally  the  reason  why  IK,  SDL  and  technology integration are omitted from teaching and learning activities.

In summary, CAPS provides ample opportunity and practices that  are  essential  to  empower  communities  and  better  equip learners  with  critical  skills  to  become  self-directed  learners, have  a  fundamental  understanding  of  IK  and  how  to  skilfully integrate  technology  to  achieve  these  goals.  Educators  must adhere  to  the  call  of  the  general  aims  of  CAPS  (Republic  of South Africa 2011a).

## The Professional Development Framework for Digital Learning

The importance of the DBE's proposed PDFDL also needs to be discussed. It is good news that the DBE will roll out PDFDL from 2019,  wherein  they  aim  to  build  educators'  competencies  in facilitating learning with digital tools and resources (DBE 2017). Goal 16 of the DBE Action Plan to 2019 commits the Department and relative role players to improve the professionalism, teaching skills, subject  knowledge  and  computer  literacy  of  teachers throughout their careers. Furthermore, the Integrated Strategic Planning  Framework  for  Teacher  Education  and  Development commits to the investment in digital technologies to support the enrolment of the strategy with regard to (DBE 2017):

- · the need for specific teacher knowledge and practice standards for each subject area or area of teacher expertise
- · the  establishment  of  Professional  Learning  Communities  to strengthen teacher professionalism. (p. 8)

The  PDFDL  will  guide  the  professional  development  of teachers  and  all  stakeholders  using  digital  tools  and  content resources to support improved learning outcomes and higher learner achievement in the curriculum. It also provides guidelines for  professional  development,  specifically  in  order  to,  firstly, provide  capable  teachers  and  lecturers  who  can  successfully integrate technologies to improve  teaching  and  learning. Secondly, to afford leaders, managers and support personnel who are capable of facilitating  and  continuously  guiding  the advance of teachers' digital learning capabilities. Therefore, the main  target  employees  of  this  framework  will  be  those  who train  teachers,  school  leaders  and  managers  as  well  as  the teachers themselves, e-learning experts and curriculum subject professionals (DBE 2017).

It  is  important  to  note  that  this  framework  will  encourage educators  to  do  clear  planning  for  the  integration  of  digital learning, so that learners can achieve curriculum goals with the support of appropriate teaching and learning approaches where digital tools and content resources are used. This framework will show that adopting a range of pedagogical approaches, such as SDL, problem-based and project-based learning, will improve the potential  of  limited  digital  tools  and  resources  to  support  and enhance learning (DBE 2017). The framework will be successful if teachers are able to gain a clear understanding of how digital applications, resources and tools will be used to meet particular goals  within  subjects  of  the  curriculum  to  increase  learners' performance (Moseley et al. 1999).

Digital  learning involves  the  use  of  appropriate  digital  tools and resources in both e-learning and mobile learning to reinforce teachers' teaching and learners' learning experiences, resulting in better learner performance  and  enhanced  achievement  of curriculum learning objectives. The White Paper on e-Education (2004) required a changing teaching and learning methodology and is still upheld by the new proposed digital framework where teachers and learners will have access to (DBE 2017):

- · high-quality,  relevant  and  diverse  resources,  beyond  what current school libraries are providing
- · means of communicating and collaborating with other learners and teachers
- · opportunities  of  creating  and  presenting  new  knowledge. (p. 11)

This  requires  a  transition  in  learning  that  fully  harnesses  the power  of  digital  tools  and  resources  to  impact  all  aspects  of learning, including how teachers mediate learning, how learners use digital tools and content resources, and how that learning is assessed (DBE 2017). The aims of CAPS, as was stated earlier in this chapter, are to produce learners who can do just that. These aims align with the pedagogical factors of the change presented in this framework  to  develop  learning  activities  that  could embrace a wide variety of opportunities to use digital tools and resources.

The next section presents the empirical investigation by means of  a  critical  review  of  existing  literature  on  technologies  that support the affordances of IK.

## Technologies that support the affordances of indigenous knowledge: Indications from current literature

Although the two terms may seem paradoxical, technology and IK may be infused in an effective way. As was noted earlier in the chapter, we define technology as computer- and Internet-based resources that can be used in an educational setting. We thus accept  the  definition  by  Siyanbola  et  al.  (2012)  but  relate  it specifically  to  computer  and  Internet  technologies.  Siyanbola et al. (2012) define technology as the application of knowledge in providing solutions to problems. That being said, it is accepted that not all technologies are deemed appropriate when attempting to teach IK in an SDL context. It is clear that one first

needs to unpack appropriate technologies and ITs (as it provides the  right  framework  for  recommending  technologies  in  IK  to enhance an SDL context).

## Defining appropriate technologies and indigenous technologies for indigenous knowledge

## Appropriate technologies

Various definitions exist regarding appropriate technologies and what they encompass. One of the earliest definitions found in the  body  of  scholarship  is  that  of  Thormann  (1979)  where appropriate technologies is defined in terms of resources, small production units and people. When  defining appropriate technologies in terms of resources, he states that they should be rigorous in terms of labour and using products that are produced domestically,  and  cost-effective  in  terms  of  capital  and  the selection  of  suitably  trained  personnel.  He  continues  to  note that  the  production  units  should  be  effective  despite  being modest; replicable; and easy to function, sustain and repair. They should also be inexpensive and readily available to all. Finally, Thormann  refers  to  appropriate  technology  in  terms  of  the people who use it and hence states that it should be compatible with local cultural and social environments. Iloka (2016:3) notes that appropriate technology can be divided into hard and soft technologies; hard technologies use ideas from Natural Science to manage issues related to humans, whereas soft technologies use local laws and experiences to promote human development. Recently, Tharakan (2015) defined appropriate technologies as technologies where production requires little capital, uses local materials, is labour-intensive, and is small-scale and affordable. More importantly, Sianipar et al. (2013) suggest that appropriate technologies should be used to  sustain  any  efforts  in  communities. This  links  directly  to  IK  interventions  posed  in  communities. According  to Sianipar et al., technologies are viewed  as

appropriate when the user of such technologies can afford them, while, at the same time, having technology that is sophisticated enough to function in a high technical system that can increase the user's wealth and skills. In view of this, it becomes evident that IK and appropriate technologies, with their unique characteristics, have a common ground.

## Characteristics of appropriate technologies for indigenous knowledge

There are varied opinions about the characteristics of appropriate technologies  for  IK;  however,  the  feature  that  does  appear  to be  dominant  is  that  appropriate  technology  encompasses  the holistic inclusion of the local community throughout the development process (Tharakan 2015). These include that they should  be  cost-effective  and  require  minimal  capital  outlay, should make use of local material as far as possible, should be fairly  labour-intensive,  small-scale  and  affordable  (Iloka  2016; Tharakan  2015).  The  philosophy  of  appropriate  technologies demands that they be grounded within the community and that the  implementation  and  development  thereof  can  engage  the community, which should result in capacity-building and empowerment  (Tharakan  2015).  This  implies  that,  within  the community, appropriate technologies should be comprehensible, controllable and maintainable. In order for the more sophisticated technology to be successfully operated and maintained, the local community needs to keep up to date with technical aspects. This is often not possible within local communities (Tharakan 2015). Local communities should always be included in all stages of any form of technological implementation or intervention, including the conceptualisation thereof; the process of development, from innovation  to  development  to  implementation;  as  well  as  the monitoring and evaluation of the intervention (Tharakan 2015). Appropriate technologies should minimise or, if possible, eliminate adverse environmental impacts and at the same time be adaptable and flexible (Tharakan 2015). Technologies that are capital-intensive and that are of a large scale can still be deemed

appropriate provided that the emphasis is on empowering the community, limiting environmental impacts and increasing sustainability (Tharakan 2015).

## Indigenous technologies

Indigenous  technologies  are  defined  differently  by  different researchers. Gumbo (2012) defines indigenous as something that is inborn in a specific context. He continues by saying that ITs are those artefacts that indigenous people produce. Manabete and Umar  (2014:54)  define  technology  as  the  manner  in  which resources,  skills  and  knowledge  are  applied  to  address  the objectives  and  requirements  of  a  specific  group  of  people. However, they (Manabete &amp; Umar 2014:56) note six characteristics that set aside ITs from other technologies:

- · ITs are practical, receptive and accountable within the ecology where they originate
- · they promote a culture of learning that assists in the revival and transformation of knowledge
- · by  using  meaningful  interaction,  they  aim  to  incorporate knowledge and experiences of the original world from where they come from
- · they exist and function on an ethical level
- · they are in agreement with the natural order of things
- · they have fundamental value because their history and origin is known.

Both appropriate technologies and ITs are relevant in the quest to understand the use of technology in the affordances of IK in education. The following section specifically gives examples of technologies.

## Examples of technologies

Different technologies can be used to promote the teaching of IK.  As  mentioned  above,  Iloka  (2016)  refers  to  soft  and  hard technologies.  Soft  technologies  refer  to  the  way  in  which indigenous methods are applied to solve communal problems.

This entails the use of indigenous laws as well as experiences to change nature and encourage the advancement of society (Iloka 2016:3). Hard technology refers to the application of knowledge derived from Natural Science, thereby converting the ideas from soft technology into something more tangible.

In the literature study by Gumbo (2012), reference is made to various fields that employ ITs. These include:

- · food technologies (e.g. dehydrated granular food products)
- · metallurgical technologies  (e.g. carbon  steel, which  was produced  in  Tanzania  approximately  2000  years  ago,  and copper smelting, which was developed in West Africa)
- · astronomical technologies (e.g. a stone astronomical observatory was created in Kenya)
- · tools technologies (e.g. bone tools and blades from Southern and Eastern Africa)
- · architectural and engineering technologies (e.g. the construction  of  Great  Zimbabwe,  the  stone  city,  more  than 800 centuries ago)
- · transport  technologies  (e.g.  the  construction  of  watercrafts for jungle canoes)
- · agricultural technologies (e.g. the cultivation and harvesting of barley, cowpea, millet and sorghum)
- · medical  technologies  (e.g.  aspirin  and  the  use  of  herbs  for various medical conditions)
- · communication technologies (e.g. drumming scripts that were used to relay news over great distances).

Where the above-mentioned examples refer to ITs, Toth, Smith and  Giroux  (2018)  give  examples  of  computer-  and  Internetbased  resources  to  empower  indigenous  people.  Their  article addresses  problems  that  indigenous  people  encounter  with regard to basic services such as technology, education and health care. As far as technology is concerned, they refer specifically to public spaces equipped with computers and free access to the Internet. This should preferably be in a community meeting place, which  strengthens  the  indigenous  culture  of  unified  learning, meeting with elders and children's centres. Concerning education, they suggest that computer technology can significantly improve

the  lives  of  indigenous  people.  Improved  access  to  communications technology  and  computers  in  schools  and  communities  will promote distance learning, which enables residents to remain in their communities while undergoing necessary training. Access to  instruction  in  technology  and  programming  can  assist  in reinforcing and distributing their culture by creating their own online content. Using open-source software is also important for creating  their  own  online  content.  Access  to  technology  in education can also assist in incorporating indigenous languages into the classroom and serve as a way to preserve and protect orally transferred knowledge from economic exploitation through adequate licencing.

Furthermore,  various  technologies  can  be  used  to  provide access to health care (Toth et al.  2018).  These  include  remote patient  monitoring  and  teleconferencing  with  specialists,  twoway video feeds and video conferencing that assist midwives in remote locations to access the advice of doctors, iPads or tablets that  assist  hospitalised  patients  to  keep  in  touch  with  their families  who  live  in  remote  areas  (this  is  done  through  Skype, FaceTime and other face-to-face communication applications), online  support  groups  and  video  conferencing  that  assist  in supporting the community with issues such as substance abuse and suicide. A critical literature review was executed to the use of technology in IK.

## Critical literature review

In order to perform the critical review of the existing literature, a detailed search was carried out using a combination of search terms that were determined by the framework of this chapter. The  selection  criteria  for  inclusion  of  the  documents  were  as follows:

- · documents published between 2008 and 2018
- · documents sourced using the following search terms: 'indigenous knowledge', 'appropriate technology', 'indigenous technology' and 'indigenous education'

- · documents published in peer-reviewed journals or conference proceedings which are accessible via the EBSCOhost database
- · quantitative, qualitative or mixed-method research
- · research from any content area.

The initial search provided 64 documents for investigation. Upon initial perusal of the abstracts, only 10 documents were retained. The full texts were studied and key works in the field, which were not identified through the search, were included for analysis. This yielded a total of 12 documents for analysis, which are discussed in Table 10.1.

From  Table  10.1,  it  is  evident  that  the  research  on  IK,  and especially technology in IK, has a broad scope. The documents from  the  search  were  categorised  into  six  specific  aspects. Although  not  all  documents  made  a  mention  of  each  of  the aspects, the results from each aspect are discussed.

## Indigenous knowledge

From the documents consulted, it is clear that IK is seen as an important concept and has been receiving special attention since the dawn of democracy in South Africa. Although IK has been prioritised,  the  implementation  and  infusion  thereof  into  the school and higher education curriculum have not yet materialised. Specific  subjects  where  IK  can  easily  be  infused  have  been identified:

- · Life Sciences
- · Natural Sciences
- · Mathematics
- · Technology Education.

All four  of  these  subjects  have  successfully  been  used  to incorporate IK into the curriculum.

Findings showed  that in the  field of Natural  Sciences and  Life Sciences,  teachers do  not use the  pedagogy of  puppetry; they  lack the required  training, skill and  knowledge of  pedagogy and  content to use  the pedagogy  of puppetry as  a pedagogy;  they were able  to see the value  of drama and  puppetry as a  pedagogy; and  the border- crossing  between science  and IK can  prompt their  SDL.. |

## Appropriate technology or indigenous technology

From the documents referred to, it became clear that more of the literature in our search results focussed on appropriate technologies as opposed to ITs. Some documents did, however, make a mention of examples of ITs (see 'Examples of technologies' for  examples  of  technologies).  It  is  important  to  note  the  fact that  several  studies  showed  how  IK  perspectives  need  to  be prioritised when using appropriate technologies. The link between appropriate technologies and IK was also highlighted owing to both placing great focus on the community in which they are implemented.

## Addressing the characteristics of appropriate technologies for indigenous knowledge

As mentioned above, several specific characteristics of appropriate technologies need to be evident. From the corpus of documents referred to in this literature study, it became evident that  the  most  prominent  characteristic  is  the  engagement of  the  community.  All  the  documents  that  were  focussed on  appropriate  technology  highlighted  the  inclusion  of  the community. Two documents, however, specifically focussed on addressing all the characteristics of appropriate technologies. None  of  the  documents,  however,  gave  specific  insight  into appropriate  technologies  and  how  their  characteristics  can inform the affordances of IK.

## Context

Most  documents  were  placed  within  the  context  of  South African education. Specifically, the documents focussed on Life Sciences, Natural Sciences, Mathematics and Technology education. Although not all of the documents were placed in a specific context (being literature review studies), the documents that  made  a  mention  of  their  specific  contexts  were  mostly

placed  within  rural  communities  (e.g.  Hantam,  Namakwa  and Limpopo).  The  two  documents  that  were  not  placed  in  the South African context made a mention of Australia and Quebec. It is thus difficult to derive any specific conclusions about the context.

## Example of technology

Six of the documents made no reference to technology at all. The rest could all be classified into two main categories relating to examples of technology, namely, examples of ITs and computer and Internet-based technologies. Indigenous technologies include food technology, metallurgical technology, astronomical technology, tools technology, architecture and engineering technology, transport technology, agricultural technology, medical technology, communications technology and educational technology in the form of 'boomwhackers' and puppets. Although not  evident  in  the  search  results,  it  is  also  worth  mentioning Jackson, De Beer and White's (2016) use of Foldscope technology to promote IK. The examples that were listed for computer and Internet-based technologies include Internet access, communications technology such as two-way video feeds and video conferencing, and mobile technology in the form of iPads and tablets.

## Education and teaching

The aspect of education and teaching can be classified into three different categories, namely, teacher training, education outside of  teacher  education  and,  the  largest  component,  teaching  in practice.

With regard to teacher training, the documents revealed that emphasis  should  be  placed  on  involving  the  holders  of  IK  in teacher  training  to  provide  authentic  learning  experiences  for prospective teachers. Two articles dealt with education outside the field of teacher education: the first article focuses specifically

on physical education with specific focus on health and education issues;  the  second  article  offers  suggestions  on  how  to  link appropriate technology with education.

The  largest  component  of  information  from  the  corpus  of documents,  which  relates  to  education  and  teaching,  makes reference  to  teaching  in  practice.  Various  factors  influence teachers' inclusion of IK in their teaching. Teachers who were given  the  opportunity  to  engage  with  the  community  in  IK informed their competencies to contextualise their Science and Mathematics teaching. Not only did the teachers express the need for professional development in the field of IK and how to infuse IK into their classrooms, but they believed that teaching IK  could  promote  learners'  interest  and  motivation  in  the sciences. Six of the documents  involved  an  intervention programme to inform teachers about how to include IK in their classrooms.  The  research  on  these  intervention  programmes were able to identify design principles for the design of future courses and programmes, give teachers a better understanding and  appreciation  of  IK,  make  the  teachers  more  reflective practitioners and highlight how IK can be infused into the CAPS curriculum.

Further to the professional development regarding IK, various other  teaching-learning  aspects  were  revealed  in  the  corpus. Teachers  do  not  generally  use  the  pedagogy  of  puppetry  in Natural Sciences and Life Sciences (refer to Ch. 8). In addition, although  teachers  can  see  the  affordances  of  drama  and puppetry as a pedagogy, they lack either the necessary training and skills or PCK to use puppets effectively in the classroom. Teachers' often underdeveloped views of the tenets of science (which includes its creative nature) also lead to the marginalisation of puppetry as a pedagogy. Teachers generally confuse the concept of CL with group work. As with puppetry, teachers also have limited PCK to effectively implement CL in the classroom. Within a broader educational arena, one of the articles  pointed  out  that  access  to  technology  can  provide

indigenous  people  with  the  opportunity  to  study  through distance  education,  which  holds  several  advantages  for  rural communities, namely, it can assist in incorporating indigenous languages in the classroom, and various health care issues can be addressed.

The next section deals with the wider potential of Geographical  Information  Systems  (GIS),  Google  Earth  and Maps to integrate IK, SDL and technology in the curriculum as an example of how the combination of these elements can be operationalised.

## The potential of Geographical Information Systems, Google Earth and Maps to integrate indigenous knowledge, self-directed learning and technology in the curriculum

Geographical information systems, Google Earth and Maps can be integrated into subjects across the curriculum, but they are most fitting for the CAPS of Geography. The CAPS document for Geography insists that SDL skills are nurtured through relevant teaching and learning strategies. The fourth general aim is very specific as it aims (DBE 2017):

[ T ]o produce learners that are able to identify and solve problems, as well as make decisions by using critical and creative thinking, and by  working  effectively  as  individuals  and  with  others  as  members of a team; use science and technology effectively and critically, by showing responsibility  towards  the  environment  and  the  health  of others; and demonstrate an understanding of the world as a set of related systems by recognising that problem-solving contexts do not exist in isolation. (pp. 4, 5)

Learners are also encouraged to nurture an obligation towards sustainable development, a consciousness of sensitive issues and great  inequality  in  the  world,  as  well  as  thorough  balanced evaluations of social and environmental issues (Van der

Westhuizen  &amp;  Golightly  2018).  Learner-centred  instructional methods are designed to foster Geography learners' skills such as  information  management  skills,  critical  thinking,  problemsolving, self-assessment, collaborative and CL - all typical skills of self-directedness (Golightly &amp; Van der Westhuizen 2017).

As was stated earlier, a general aim of Geography in the South African CAPS is to encourage the use of applicable technology applications  and  GIS.  It  suggests  that  GIS  can  develop  skills  in learners that help them understand and solve global challenges. 'The  catalytic  ability  of  GIS  to  grasp  both  the  world  in  general and  the  complexity  of  geographic  phenomena  in  particular' (Madsen &amp; Rump 2012:98) has revitalised the importance of and interest in school Geography. Indeed, the swiftness with which GIS can dynamically re-represent the globe allows to address current critical  issues,  for  example, biodiversity, limited water resources, agriculture, economics and sustainability (all applicable to IK as well). According to Madsen and Rump (2012), the leading claim for  including  GIS  practice  in  Geography  is  to  develop  learner's geospatial thinking skills, which at the same time improve learners' conceptual understanding and exploring capabilities with specific exercises  on  how  to  solve  real-world  problems.  In  fact,  when teaching  Geography  themes through GIS,  it is advised  that fostering self-directed teaching and learning strategies such as PBL be integrated to establish and enhance these skills. Geographical Information  Systems  education  also  cultivates  the  expansion of  higher-order  thinking  skills,  such  as  problem-solving,  critical thinking and reflection. Thus, the CAPS, especially for Geography, poses good potential in adhering to the mentioned advantages of GIS integration (Van der Westhuizen &amp; Golightly 2018).

Regarding  IK  in  the  Geography  classroom,  teachers  should embrace different IK systems from the diverse group of learners in class  and  they  should  harness  the  technological  knowledge  of learners (Bornman 2018). With reference to IK in the CAPS, the general aims for Geography hold as one of its principles that it 'values indigenous knowledge systems and should acknowledge

the  rich history and  heritage  of  this country  as  important contributors to nurturing the values contained in the Constitution' (Republic of South Africa 2011c:5). This is also supported in the DBE document 'Responding to diversity' (Republic of South Africa 2011b), which points out the issue of diversity at different levels of society and stresses that learners hold different life experiences coming  from  a  variety  of  communities.  This  document  further outlines strategies to enhance inclusive teaching such as the fact that  technology  must  be  implemented  and  integrated  in  the teaching and learning processes to ensure that IK is valued and instilled into school activities. By infusing IK into the Geography curriculum,  it  is  easier  to  contextualise  topics  for  higher-order knowledge  construction  (Gibbons  2000).  In  fact,  there  is  no reference in the CAPS on how IK should be integrated throughout a calendar year in the curriculum (Republic of South Africa 2011c).

In  the  South  African  school  context,  besides  the  difficulties and  barriers  with  GIS  implementation,  it  is  also  the  teaching through  GIS  (Breetzke,  Eksteen  &amp;  Pretorius  2011;  Fleischmann 2012)  and  IK  that  is  not  integrated  into  suitable  Geography themes. Both these problems can be addressed by the effective use of easily accessible and navigable free web-based software and applications with access to local data. Geographical Information Systems is not a prerequisite for the integration of IK in Geography lessons, but according to Bornman (2018), it may afford teachers and learners the opportunity to study the subject in context and to incorporate local and IK in the learning process while using GIS, thus, teaching through GIS.

A  valuable  way  to  integrate  IK  with  technology  into  the curriculum is, thus, with the use of GIS and Google Earth and Maps. Working with map skill-related tools and applications, such as GIS, Google Earth and Google Maps, falls within the spectrum of spatial thinking, which is being recognised globally as a valuable aspect of problem-solving within a wide selection of academic disciplines (Lee  &amp;  Bednarz  2009:183).  Spatial  thinking  is  a  multifaceted concept consisting of several factors, including spatial visualisation,

spatial orientation and spatial relations (National Research Council 2006), all needing higher-order learning skills that can be learnt and  taught  formally  to  students,  using  appropriately  designed tools, technologies and curricula. It is within this domain that IK can easily be integrated in teaching through GIS (especially Google Earth) in certain geographical themes. Geographical Information Systems has become a welcome tool for teachers in the current digital and information-saturated era to foster learners' critical and metacognitive thinking abilities, sorting through an overabundance of information (Goldstein 2010).

Finally, in practice, it is quite possible to teach integrated GIS and instil IK into the Geography classroom by utilising Google Earth and Google Maps on different platforms as mediation tools. By linking modern technology with established map skills and IK in a multidimensional reality, Geography teachers may be able to improve the SDL and map work skills of learners while allowing learners from all cultural spheres to participate by accommodating their  perceptions  and  knowledge  systems.  Including  IK  in  the class through GIS and map work may make the technology more understandable to learners as they would be able to learn GIS concepts and functions while focussing on something they find familiar  (Bornman 2018). It  is  therefore  a  great  opportunity  to teach  and  learn  about  IK  through  technology  applications  in Geography and at the same time foster valuable SDL skills for learners of students.

## Recommended technological interventions for indigenous knowledge in teaching practice

From the above, the following recommendations can be made for possible technological interventions for IK in teaching practice:

- · Focus should be on appropriate technologies when incorporating  technology  in  IK  as  appropriate  technologies allow for efforts in communities to be sustainable.

- · The technology interventions (albeit e-technology) should be focussed on empowering the community, limiting environmental  impacts  and  increasing  sustainability,  which should result in capacity-building and empowerment.
- · Some  e-technology  examples  that  have  been  suggested include Internet access, communications technology such as two-way  video  feeds  and  video  conferencing,  and  mobile technology in the form of iPads and tablets.
- · Computer technology can significantly  improve  the  lives  of indigenous people. Improved  access to communications technology and computers in schools and communities enable residents  to  remain  in  their  communities  while  undergoing necessary training.
- · Using open-source software is important for creating online content relating to IK. Access to technology in education can assist in incorporating indigenous languages into the classroom.
- · Make use of free technology applications such as Google Earth and  Maps  to  foster  map  work  and  SDL  skills  with  themes, wherein IK can easily be integrated, challenging learners to incorporate  their  own  experience  systems  into  multicultural learning environment contexts.
- · The  affordances  technology  could  provide  in  terms  of  the accommodation  of  indigenous languages as carriers of indigenous culture and knowledge should also be considered.
- · The  potential  for  Open  Educational  Resources  (OERs)  as  a means for sharing, reuse and publication of IK should not be underestimated.  The  William  and  Flora  Hewlett  Foundation (2018)  defines  OERs  as  'teaching,  learning  and  research materials in any medium - digital or otherwise - that reside in the public domain or have been released under an open license that permits no-cost access, use, adaptation and redistribution by  others  with  no  or  limited  restrictions'.  In  this  way,  the preservation of IK can be supported.
- · Archiving or storing IK for educational purposes by means of  technology  should  be  done  in  consultation  with  IK holders.  Shizha  (2016:57)  also  highlights  the  concerns regarding the dispossession of traditional knowledge. Therefore,  proper  acknowledgement  and  negotiations  on

including  IK  in  repositories  are  imperative.  This  can  also help to protect and acknowledge the holders of a particular intellectual property.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this chapter  focuses  on  the  affordances  of technology  for  teaching  IK.  The  research  was  theoretically underpinned by literature on SDL, educational technology and IK systems. From a review of CAPS, the relevance of IK systems was evident, and an appropriate policy framework exists where SDL can be fostered and technology can be implemented within the South African school context. The DBE's PDFDL is also a further extension of how the inclusion of technology can be supported.

This chapter also explored technologies and teaching-learning strategies  that  support  the  teaching  of  IK,  as  evidenced  from current literature. To this end, appropriate technologies and ITs for IK  were  defined  and  set  characteristics  were  identified.  The parameters of what ITs would entail were also set out, whereafter examples of relevant technologies were presented. Furthermore, a critical review of the existing literature was presented. From this review,  it  was  evident  that  the  research  on  IK,  and  especially technology in IK, has a broad scope. The importance of IK is clear; yet, the implementation of IK in the curriculum has been insufficient. From  the  review,  the  infusion  of  IK  into  Life  Sciences,  Natural Sciences, Mathematics and Technology education is proven. Most of  the  literature  in  the  search  results  focussed  on  appropriate technologies  as  opposed  to  ITs.  The  link  between  appropriate technologies  and  IK  was  also  established.  The  most  prominent characteristic in the review was the engagement of the community, and this seems to be a possible point of further investigation. Most of the reviewed literature focussed on the South African context. In terms of technology, the focus was on ITs and computer- and Internet-based technologies. The teaching focus in the review was on teacher training, education outside of teacher education and, the largest component, teaching in practice.

The  chapter  concluded  with  recommended  technological interventions (specifically also in Geography) for IK in teaching practice based on the literature overview and critical review of the identified sources. It is therefore evident that clear affordances of technology for teaching IK can be identified, but that further development, support and research are necessary in this regard.

## Summary

In this chapter, the affordances of technology for teaching IK are explored. The use of technology provides unique opportunities to  embed  IK  in  different  subjects  while  adhering  to  blended learning, e-learning and SDL principles as set out in the relevant literature. Also, within the context of teacher education, relevant curriculum policy documents were analysed. This research aimed to determine, by means of a critical review of existing research literature,  how  the  inclusion  of  IK  in  different  contexts  can  be supported by employing various technologies. Drawing from the lack of empirically investigated practices that foster SDL while supporting  the  integration  of  IK  using  technology  in  different subjects, a number of recommendations are made in this chapter.

## Introduction

Come through the door not the window Steenkamp (n.d.)

Andries Steenkamp was a respected leader in the San community. His dedication towards protecting his people is memorialised in the San Code of Ethics (SASI 2017). In a publicly available video interview conducted with San leadership, Steenkamp (in Vaalbooi n.d.) used the metaphor of a house to describe San IK research ethics:

If you want to get something useful you first need to put your own house in order. Your house must have a door, so that nobody needs

De Beer (ed.), The decolonisation of the curriculum project: The affordances of  indigenous  knowledge  for  self-directed  learning (NWU Self-directed  Learning  Series Volume 2), pp. 319-346, AOSIS, Cape Town. https://doi.org/10.4102/aosis.2019.BK133.11

to enter by the window. You must come in via the door; that is to say via the San Council. We do not ask for money, not at all. It has never happened that the San Council asks money for research. (n.p.)

Ethics of mutuality, respect and reciprocity are embedded in the metaphor. Steenkamp cautions us to exhibit respect and reciprocity in research engagements. Based on the San indigenous perspective of shared existence, he recognises that different knowledge houses exist; however,  respect  is  necessary  in  that  shared  existence. Everyone  is  deserving  of  the  respect  and  decency  of  a  proper entrance. However, this is a grace not historically extended to San people (Barnard 1992:5; Mountain 2003:1). His story admonishes the lack of respect exhibited by researchers not following prescribed channels of ethical research. A history of individual and collective experiences of ethical abuses is embedded in the text of the San Code of Research Ethics.

The Nature journal stated that San Code of Research Ethics is the first indigenous code of researcher ethics in Africa, designed to protect San IK and people (Callaway 2017). The San indigenous people of South(ern) Africa have endured a history of assault on their IK, traditional communities and ways of life. Most recently, four members of the San community were exploited in genome sequencing  research  (Schroeder  et  al.  2016:36).  The  stated purpose of the research was to 'characterise' genomic diversity of Southern Africans to support their inclusion in medical research innovations  (Schuster  et  al.  2010:943).  The  research  project adhered to institutional research ethics policy and was approved by institutional review boards in three countries, namely, South  Africa, the United States of America  and  Australia, without consultation  with  the  San  leadership.  The  researchers published  the  genetic  findings  of  the  research  as  well  as  a supplementary  document  in Nature ,  a  peer-reviewed  academic journal.  The  document made unsubstantiated claims, pejorative assumptions and stereotypical assumptions that were generalised across the San population (Schroeder et al. 2016:37). The document strayed from the stated research focus and resulted in collective embarrassment,  discrimination  and  psychological  harm  to  the

San  community.  This  violation  is  one  event  in  the  history  of unethical research on holders of IK.

San leaders challenged the ethical validity of the research but to  no  avail.  Members  of  the  leadership  council  contested  the consent procedures and repeatedly requested access to informed consents and research documentation. The requests were denied as  researchers  attested  that  verbal  consent  was  granted  by participants. The then Deputy Director of the Working Group of Indigenous Minorities in Southern Africa, Mathambo Ngakaeaja, formally addressed the arrogance, ignorance and cultural myopia demonstrated by the researchers and the institutions (Schroeder et al. 2016:37).

The genome research is not an isolated event in San history. The San peoples are among the oldest indigenous communities in South Africa (Barnard 1992). All extant humans are believed to have evolved from the ancestors of the San (Krueger 2011), and they hold IK essential for environmental sustainability (Schroeder 2009:11). Historically, they are adept hunters in desert climates such  as  the  Kalahari  Desert.  Their  IK  includes  the  use  of  the succulent Hoodia gordonii to sustain them on day-long hunting journeys. Measured consumption of the desert succulent maintains clarity as well as suppresses hunger. Unbeknown to the San  community,  the  CSIR  of  the  South  African  government secured a patent for the commercial use of Hoodia as a dietary supplement.  The  government  agency  sold  the  patent  to  the pharmaceutical company Phytopharm (Tellez 2007:1). Governmental  and  corporate  agencies  gained  material  wealth from San IK with little benefit to the San community.

The genome research and Hoodia theft emerge from the struggle between  knowledge  and  power  in  former  colonised  territories. Western  knowledge  has  power  in  the  academy,  whereas  IK  is excluded (Canham 2018:4; Odora Hoppers 2001:78). It is important to  note  that  the  behaviour  of  the  genome  researchers  was  sanctioned by foreign institutional review boards and ethics policies, even  though  it  was  in  violation  of  local  San  IK  research  ethics.

This suggests that social and political shifts that recognise IK as national and academic assets may not be sufficient in stemming ontological violence against historically oppressed  groups  of people;  decolonisation  of  institutional  ethics  review  processes generally, and institutional research ethics specifically, holds potential for improving the relationship between IK communities and academic research institutions. Research ethics policies influence major aspects of research design such as problem posing, community  engagement  and  data  collection  activities;  however, scant  literature  examines  the  impact  of  decolonisation  on  institutional research ethics policies.

Institutional  research  ethics  policies  that  do  not  consider  IK research ethics may allow colonial practices to continue through educational research (Battiste 2005:2; Smith 1999:24). Arguably, the lack of such examination perpetuates economic, educational and social inequities in previously colonised countries, which are exacerbated in emerging first-world nations such as South Africa, where a diversity of IK groups exists (Ntuli 1999; Odora Hoppers 2001; Vilakazi 1999), thus making IK research ethics an important issue in the decolonisation of institutional research ethics policies and practices.

This research views institutional research ethics policy through a  postcolonial  indigenous  lens,  which  recognises  the  historical struggles and epistemological conflicts that are at the heart of the process of inclusion of IK in institutional policies and research practices. Postcolonial indigenous thought  interrogates the relationship between power and knowledge in the research ethics process, as well as in researcher practice (Chilisa2012:19).

The authors were guided by two main research questions:

- · How does an institutional research ethics policy integrate IK research ethics in policy?
- · How can the roles and responsibilities of academic researchers be answerable to IK research ethics?

To this end, the authors investigated the alignment of institutional research ethics policy with IK research ethics and then examined

our academic roles and responsibilities in IK research ethics. This investigation  is  purposed  to  inform  academic  debates  on  the decolonisation of institutional research ethics policy.

The main purpose of this chapter is to investigate decolonisation from  a  policy  perspective  to  determine  the  recognition  of  IK, acknowledgement  of  IK  research  ethics  and  the  inclusion  of indigenous ways of knowing into institutional research ethics policy. This investigation and discussion consider the effects of institutional research  ethics  policies  in  the  continued  marginalisation  of  IK research ethics.

## Background context

In  South Africa, the relationship between institutions of higher education and IK groups was shaped by colonialism and moulded by  apartheid  (Heleta  2016:1;  McKaiser  2016;  Ramoupi  2014:5). Both systems advanced the idea of white supremacy and inferior others (Cesaire 2000:43). Colonialism established a knowledge hierarchy  that  instituted  European  ideologies  and  subjugated local  knowledges,  and  the  apartheid  regime  'entrench(ed)  the power  and  privilege  of  the  ruling  white  minority'  (Bunting 2004:52; Pietsch 2013). The explicit structures of these systems are  no  longer  visible,  but  the  ideologies  are  inscribed  into educational institutions as universal truths (Kelley 2000:27). The South African university system served to 'construct and maintain the social, political and economic features of the apartheid order' (Gibbon  &amp;  Kabaki  2004:123).  Systemic  disqualification  of  the black majority and IKs went hand-in-hand, resulting in the exclusion of IKs from the universities. Eurocentrism was the 'epistemological truth' (Motta 2013:97) undergirding all aspects of education, including curriculum (Jansen  1998:111; Zeleza 2009:133),  research  (Datta  et  al.  2015:581;  Owusu-Ansah  &amp;  Mji 2013:1) and institutional culture (Jansen 2012:18). Such a system reproduces itself while simultaneously silencing other knowledges and  ways  of  thinking  (Kaya  &amp;  Seleti  2013:34).  Epistemological violence  of  erasure,  exclusion  and  insecurity  are  arguably  the

most  destructive  and  long-lasting  effects  of  these  oppressive systems (Shiza &amp; Kariwo 2006:20).

Epistemological violence is defined as social-historical processes of imperialistic, epistemic inscription (Spivak 1994:80). Inscription of one knowledge results in the violent subjugation of other ways of knowing. It erases the history of indigenous peoples (Wilson  2004:359)  and  precludes  critical  interrogation  of  the 'outcomes of a history of patriarchy, slavery, imperialism, colonialism, white supremacy and capitalism' (Molefe 2016:32). In post-1994  South  Africa,  decolonisation  efforts  should  aim  to disrupt 'the political economy of knowledge' (Dei 2000:129) by rejecting Euro and Western ideologies as the only way of knowing (Pillay  2015;  Zeleza  2009:116).  Decolonisation  processes  clearly define African people, knowledges and histories as the centre of a universe and, thus, the university (Mbembe 2016:35), as opposed to Europe being the centre of an African reality (Ngugi 1981:93). In research, rejecting Eurocentric philosophies restructures the research process as well as the institutional ethics process (Tauri 2018:1). Aboriginal, First Nations and indigenous scholars from the United States, Canada and Australia have advanced the decolonisation  discourse  about  institutional  ethics  policies  (Bull 2010:13;  HRCNZ,  IHRC  2004,  WUN).  Voices  from  the  African context  are  largely  absent  from  the  discourse  on  decolonising institutional research ethics.

## Theoretical framework

Postcolonial  indigenous  theory  and  discourse  analysis  theory comprise  the  theoretical  framework  for  this  decolonisation project. Decolonisation is closely aligned with anticolonial processes; it emerged in formerly colonised territories to honour, reclaim and centre historically repressed IKs, people and lands (Denzin,  Lincoln  &amp;  Smith  2008;  Smith  1999:20).  Recovery  of indigenous ways of knowing in higher education can potentially foster  holistic  relationships  between  people,  environment  and cosmos  (Datta  2018:2).  Emanating  from  a  relational  ontology,

IKS  prioritise  communal  knowledge  acquisition  in  contrast  to individualistic pursuits of universalising abstract knowledge that dominates Western philosophical orientations (Simpson 2004:374). Struggles of knowledge and power are embedded in decolonisation processes in academia where Western knowledge systems were institutionalised in academic processes of research and practice (Smith 1999:26).

## Postcolonial indigenous research

The  exploration  of  IK  research  ethics  relies  on  postcolonial indigenous thought to interrogate institutional research ethics policy  as  'a  significant  site  of  struggle  between  the  interest and knowing of the West and the interest and knowing of the other'  (Smith 1999:2). The postcolonial indigenous paradigm takes a culture-specific approach towards decolonising universalisms  and  totalising  different  forms  of  knowledge production.  Indigenous  knowledge  is  the  cultural  reference capable  of  illuminating  the  historical  patterns  of  power  and knowledge  that  reproduce  deficit  thinking  and  pathological descriptions of the former colonised territories (Chilisa 2012:24). The aim of postcolonial indigenous theory is reconstructing knowledge  in the interests of historically oppressed people (Chilisa 2012:13).

Postcolonial  indigenous  research  prioritises  relationality  in  the research for IK. Relationality assumes that all aspects of life exist in a  nexus  of  relationships  (Wilson  2008:69).  Holism  is  mutually constituted through relationships in, and between, people, history, culture, place, knowledge and social processes (Martin &amp; Miraboopa 2003:205). Relational ontology is grounded in relationships between individuals and the collective, where individual rights and responsibilities  are  infused  with  those  of  collective  well-being. Knowledge  is  rooted  in  lived  experiences  and  cultural  ways  of knowing and being and is useful for the whole (Wilson 2008:70). Concepts  of  respect,  reciprocity,  responsibility  and  rights  are informed by indigenous ways of knowing.

From a postcolonial indigenous perspective, researcher roles and responsibilities extend beyond those required from Western axiological paradigms. Researchers are viewed as 'knowledge brokers' with power to legitimate indigenous ideas (Foucault 1977:27). Researchers are viewed as 'healers' with the responsibility of 'realigning' people to the natural order of the universe (Ramsey  2006). Such roles and responsibilities suggest  that  the  process  of  decolonisation  is  not  solely  an institutional responsibility  -  both  the  researcher  and  the research  must  be  decolonised  as  well  (Datta  2018:2).  Chilisa (2007:18) proposes that researchers engage in continual 'selfreflection and self-questioning' of research events and outcomes throughout the research process. She suggests that, in this 'back-and-forth' review and analysis, researchers examine their relationship with knowledge and power by interrogating colonisation roles and ethical responsibilities towards indigenous people and IK.

As  academics,  we  accepted  to  interrogate  our  role  as colonised or coloniser in this research by asking which side we are on and what needs to change? The first author is a black female postdoctoral researcher from the United States conducting research with indigenous groups in South Africa. The second author is also a black female researcher from South Africa who has experienced the apartheid regime. She is also a faculty member of the institutional research ethics committee. We  combined  research  ethics,  experiences  and  praxis  from global north  and  global  south  contexts,  recognising  the importance  of  inclusion  of  IK  in  institutional  research  ethics policy.  We  engaged  the  San  Code  of  Research  Ethics  and translated interviews with San leaders as oral texts of San IK research  ethics.  The  San  text  served  as  a  lens  to  examine the North-West University (NWU) research ethics policy  through  qualitative  research  methods.  As  authors, we  do  not  advance  superiority  of  IK;  instead,  we  seek  a relational collaboration of epistemologies focussed on interconnectedness, not competition.

## Methods

The primary purpose of this research was to critically examine institutional research  ethics  policy  from  a  San  indigenous cultural referent to discuss decolonisation of institutional research  ethics  policy.  Data  included  two  policy  documents, two interview videos and researcher notes. The qualitative data were interpretively analysed to answer the research questions. A qualitative interpretive analysis of two policy documents was used  to  answer  the  primary  research  question:  How  are  IK research ethics integrated into the institutional research policy? Elements of discourse analysis informed our interpretation of meaning embedded in the discourse of the policy. According to Codd (1988:237), policies serve political purposes of masking social  conflict  and  fostering  commitment  to  the  notion  of universal public interests. We argue that institutional research ethics policy may be a site of struggle where systemic violence is maintained.

In  postcolonial  societies,  texts  provide  reflections  of  the interconnected relationships between knowledge, power, social structures and language. Foucault (1972:205) asserted that the language of texts is socially constructed and intertwined  with  structural  elements  of  social  life.  Texts  are interactive  meaning-making  processes  that  are  considered social events (Fairclough 2003:8). Imbued with social character, texts  can  be  considered  social  events  with  'causal  effects', resulting in changes  in  knowledge,  behaviour  and  social relations (Halliday 1994:22). The  text of indigenous  and institutional research ethics policies impacts research in, and with, IK groups.

Critical  analysis  is  an  interactive  meaning-making  process that occurs in three analytical events, namely, production, text and  reception  (Fairclough  2003:27).  The  production  of  the text focuses on the producers of the text, specifically how their intentions and identity are incorporated into the text. Institutional position, values, beliefs and desires influence the

production of the text. These elements are mostly processed internally in the  authors'  minds.  The  second  element  of meaning-making is the text itself. Meaning-making depends on explicit text of what is stated as well as implicit assumptions about  what  is  not  stated.  Interplay  between  assumptions, intentions  and  language  contribute  to  meaning-making  and reception of the text. The last analytic process is the interpretive work of the reader.

This  analysis  operationalised  postcolonial  indigenous theory in the  analysis of research  ethics  policies. We  argue  that institutional research ethics policy can be a site of struggle where systemic violence is maintained. Data included The San Code of Research Ethics and the North-West University Education Research Policy, which were examined for alignment. This line of analysis disrupts the flow of knowledge from the institution onto IK groups.

Analysis proceeded individually and collectively in a sequential  manner.  Each  author  read  and  interpreted  both policies and documented their interpretations and understandings of ethical principles advanced in the policies. The  San  Code  of  Research  Ethics  was  read  and  interpreted prior to the NWU Policy and Rules for Research Ethics. Then, the  authors  discussed  alignment  and  recommendations.  By applying  indigenous  perspectives  to  institutional  policy,  we hope to illuminate  deeper  problems  and  conflict  in  research ethics policy and  contribute to knowledge  restructuring aspired  by  postcolonial  indigenous  theory.  The  next  two sections  of the  chapter  are  devoted  to  our  synthesised interpretations and discussions of the policies.

## The policies

This  section  reviews  the  ethical  tenets  of  the  San  Code  of Research Ethics and the NWU Rules and Policy for Research. More focus was afforded to the San policy, which serves as the cultural referent for this policy analysis.

## San Code of Research Ethics

On March 2, 2017, the San leadership Council of South Africa publically launched the San Code of Research Ethics (Callaway 2017:475). The document provides researchers a framework for conducting ethical research with San communities. It draws on a foundation of San IK for the purpose of protecting San people, preserving San knowledge and repairing San dignity. The code was developed in response to exploitative,  inappropriate  and  pejorative  research  conducted  by unscrupulous  researchers.  It  was  preceded  by  traditional  San leadership  that  governed  the  well-being  of  the  San  people.  The written document was intended to stem the tide of ethics dumping and damaging research conducted using San people.

The  code  advocates  for  constructive  relationships  between the  researcher  and  the  community.  Principles  of  participation and protection ensure research is in the best interests of the San community.  Researcher  roles  and  responsibilities  are  framed within the collective process of research design, data collection and publication. Researchers are tasked with cultural and social responsibilities throughout their engagement with San leadership and  communities.  The  code  requires  cultural,  historical  and linguistic  sensitivity  when  engaging  with  San  communities.  It requires  researcher  transparency  and  humility  throughout  the process. Violation of the stated roles and responsibilities carries consequences for researchers and research institutions.

Tenets of the San Code of Research Ethics are fundamental to life  and  sustainability.  San  ways  of  life  are  preserved  through collective approaches of research with as  opposed to research on San  IK  holders.  Concepts  of  respect,  honesty,  justice  and fairness, care and process are interrelated in ethical research. The tenets cannot operate in isolation; rather, they rely on each other for  meaning  and  execution  of  ethical  research.  The  authors created a visual representation of how the tenets exist relationally. Figure 11.1 demonstrates the interconnected relationship in and between the tenets. The following review of San ethical tenets should be understood based on the relationality of the tenets.

## enets of San indigenous knowledge T research ethics

## Respect

- We require respect not only for individuals but also for the community.

The San Code of Research Ethics foregrounds collective and inclusive  research  as  ethical.  Respect  is  defined  as  actions of responsiveness, deference and reverence. Researchers are

required  to  be  socially  and  culturally  responsive  in  research with  San  communities.  San  people  and  IK  are  central  to  all investigations and deference is demonstrated to San culture, history  and  'relationship  with  the  environment'  (SASI  2017). Respect  requires  San  participation  as  co-researchers  in  all aspects of research to monitor researcher responsibility.

## Honesty

- We require honesty from all of those who come to us with research proposals.

Honesty is hinged on the principle of respect. Honesty necessitates transparency and continued communication. The code specifies clear and open exchange of proposed research. Researchers are admonished to avoid academic language and jargon that hinder clear communication exchange. San leadership and participants should  have  linguistic  access  to  the  research  proposal  for  the purpose of accessing the ethicacy of the research.  This  cannot occur without researcher transparency regarding risks and benefits. Continual conversation throughout the research process is required to maintain ethical standards.

## Justice and fairness

- We require justice and fairness in research.

The tenet of justice  and  fairness  is  connected  to  honesty.  Full disclosure of how the research benefits the entire San community is expected. Justice and fairness are executed through the use of mediation and dispute resolutions, as violations of the code carry consequences for individual researchers and institutions.

## Care

- Research should be aligned with local needs and improve the lives of San. This means that the research process must be carried out with care for all involved, especially the San community.

Caring in research comprises  caring for the entire San community. Families, and social and physical environment, are included in the community. Research that does not consider the  web  of  relationships  between  people,  place  and  society may be deemed unethical by San standards. Well-being for the San  includes  the  social  welfare  of  the  collective  and  the environment.

## Process

- Researchers need to follow the processes that are set out in our research protocols carefully, in order for this Code of Ethics to work.

Process  references  the  collective  responsibility  of  both  San and institutional research community. This tenet may denote the interconnectedness of the previous ethical tenets. Process reiterates the primary focus of repairing relationships between San and institutional research communities.

## North-West University Research Ethics Policy

NWU is a 'pre-eminent University in Africa […] with a unique institutional  culture  based  upon  the  values  the  University espouses'  (North-West  University  Institutional Office n.d.: Preamble). The institutional research ethics process is regulated by the Policy and Rules for Research Ethics (PRRE). The policy dictates the rules, management  and  procedures  of the university ethics process. The policy statement is regulated by the  Department  of  Research  Support  and  monitored  by  the department  director.  The  accountable  executive  manager  is the deputy Vice-Chancellor of Institutional Research, Innovation and  Community  Engagement.  The  most  recent  policy  was adopted  on  17  November  2016  and  scheduled  for  review in  2019.  The  Rules  for  the  Management  of  Research  Ethics

(North-West University Institutional Office n.d.) defines research ethics as the following:

Research  ethics  deals  with  the  way  in  which  research  is  planned, conducted and executed, in order to ensure that the entire process conforms to rules, standards or norms for conduct as agreed upon by the research community at large. (p. 3)

The 'research community at large' is not specified in the document. Ethical guidelines and researcher responsibilities as specified in the policy and Code of Conduct are reviewed in this section of the document.

The policy is influenced by national and international forces and should be read in conjunction with supporting documents. The  text  is  informed  by  'national  and  international  ethics standards, statutory requirements and ethical principles derived from the Vision and Mission of the NWU' (North-West University Institutional  Office  n.d.:n.p.).  It  is  aimed  'to  ensure  that  all research conducted at and by the NWU are conducted in line with  ethical principles' (North-West  University  Institutional Office  n.d.:n.p.)  and  aligned  with  the National  Health  Act of 2004. The document instructs researchers to read it with the Institutional  Research  and  Innovation  Strategy  and  the  NWU mission.

The policy document specifies that research ethics should be guided by three principles, namely, beneficence, justice and respect. These principles compel researchers to assess 'projected' benefit and 'potential' harm, balance potential risks and  benefits  among  role  players  and  treat  participants  as autonomous agents. While the document does not reference the researcher Code of Conduct as an accompanying document, it is attached to the Policy and all researchers are required to consent to as part of the research ethics approval process. The Code of Conduct specifies 'four major principles of research integrity', namely, honesty, accountability, professional  courtesy  and  good  stewardship.  These  principles

are followed  by  14  ethical responsibilities for researchers during research.

Ethical principles outlined in the policy document provide the foundation for the researcher Code of Conduct and ethics management oversight. The principles are loosely connected and  generally  lack  consistency.  All  of  the  principles  are  not mirrored in the Code of Conduct principles or responsibilities. For example, the policy outlines beneficence as an assessment of benefits and harms in the proposed research. The Code of Conduct principle of good stewardship of research on behalf of others can be interpreted as assessing benefits and harms, but  no  correlated  responsibility  is  listed.  Code  of  Conduct principles  were  general  and  fluid  in  meaning,  with  each principle correlated with multiple policy principles and Code of Conduct responsibilities. For example, the Code of Conduct principle, 'good stewardship of research on behalf of others', is ambiguous. It can be interpreted to mean beneficence, justice or  respect.  In  a  similar  manner,  'others'  can  be  interpreted as  research  participants  or  research  colleagues.  Table  11.1  is intended to highlight the principles across the three documents and demonstrates a lack of ethical cohesion.

The NWU PRRE is a tripartite document. The policy preludes the  Code  of  Conduct  and  the  Rules  for  the  Management  of Research Ethics at the NWU. The latter document is by far the most  extensive  of  the  three.  The  policy  was  designed  to govern research in multiple disciplines, which may contribute to the non-specific language. Ethical principles and responsibilities  are  not  aligned  across  the  documents.  The Code  of  Conduct  responsibilities  specify  duties  specific  to academic responsibilities. The lack of ethical cohesion across the  documents  may  signal  a  lack  of  alignment  with  San  IK research  ethics.  The  next  section  examines  the  alignment between the two documents.

## Discussion

This chapter began with Andries Steenkamp's metaphorical reference to the ethical responsibilities required in research with San communities. His metaphor demonstrates a relational perspective of research and is useful in discussing the alignment with the NWU PRRE.  'Coming  through  the  door'  is  demonstrative  of  human relationships. Entering through the door requires responsibility from both parties, while entering through the window is laden with ill will and cruel intentions. In this discussion, the door is symbolic. The door  is  indicative  of  entering  into  the  San  IK  community,  where indigenous ways of being are central to understanding the world. There is also a door for entering the academy. The metaphor of the door  is  woven  throughout  this  discussion  of  IK  research  ethics. The discussion is guided by the following question: 'How does the NWU policy integrate IK research ethics?' Our interpretive analysis revealed  that  IK  remains  marginalised  in  the  policy  language, pursuits and  responsibilities. The  policy  maintains  a  Western philosophical foundation rooted in universalism, individualism and disciplinary knowledge. The policy does not explicitly mention the needs of IK groups nor does it reference IK research ethics. The NWU policy  governs  the  way  that  research  ethics  is  practised  at  the university  and  prescribes  rules  for  researchers'  interactions  with research 'subjects'. The San Code provided a perspectival vantage point to view not only the institutional policy but also our roles as academics and researchers. This research was designed to examine the  relationship  between  the  policies  of  two  entities  (San  IK community  and  an  academic  institution)  as  related  to  research ethics, but we could not ignore the fact that researchers were caught between the two worlds, compelled to choose sides. We questioned our academic role and responsibilities in conducting research with IK groups and offered recommendations for decolonising the NWU PRRE  and  restructuring  the  knowledge  of  research  ethics.  The discussion  proceeds  by  answering  the  research  question.  This discussion is specific to the cultural-historical relationship between the  San  IK  group  and  the  NWU,  which  may  not  apply  to  other

indigenous groups or academic institutions. This section concludes with recommendations for integrating San IK research ethics into the NWU research ethics policy.

## Alignment

The San Code emanates from a relational ontology, and therefore, it  focuses  on  relationships.  Based  on  lived  experiences  with research institutions, the code prioritises the relationship necessary  for  ethical  research.  It holistically addresses  the interconnected dependency between the San community, research institutions and the environment.

The NWU  fostered an individualistic philosophy. The researchers are tasked with disciplinary and academic knowledge relative to their field. They are also responsible for the integrity of their research as well as the reporting of any misconduct to the 'proper authorities' and to manage misconduct reported by the participants. The policy does not state if the university  offers  support  or  consultation  for  researchers.  The researcher assumes responsibility for not causing harm during the research process. This is not aligned with the San communal approach to research, which advocates for full participation in the  research  design,  research  activities  and  publications.  This level of involvement is not considered in the NWU policy. The policy assumes that the researcher is the holder of knowledge in the research relationship, which discredits IK ethics and ethical protocols.

The San Code demonstrates holistic knowledge. Holism is an additional  dimension  of  relationality  that  includes  sacred  and secular  worlds  (Hoffman  2010:123).  A  foundation  of  IKS  is  the inseparability of spiritual, physical and human realms (Blackstock 2007:67). The San Code references these dimensions under the principles of respect and care. The code specifies who and what should be respected and how respect is demonstrated. 'We  require  respect  not  only  for  individuals  but  also  for  the

community' (SASI 2017). According to the code, respect includes cultural,  historical  and  IK  domains.  Care  includes  cultural  and social and physical environments.

Holism  and  relationality  are  also  evident  in  the  conceptual alignment and generalisability of the San document. As discussed in the previous section, tenets of the San Code are interrelated and interdependent in definition  as  well  as  action.  Conceptual alignment  fosters  deeper  understanding  of  the  tenets  as  well. The  code  is  not  disciplinary-specific;  instead,  it  generalises  to types of research because it focuses on the San people as the knowledge  holders. The  code  foregrounds  respect as the foundation for an ethical research relationship, which applies to well-being and relationships in general.

The authors noted linguistic variance between the San Code of  Research  Ethics  and  the  videotaped  interviews  with  San leaders.  The  San  Code  was  penned  in  English  and  the  videos were  recorded  in  Afrikaans  with  English  subtitles.  Neither  of these  languages  are  indigenous  San  languages.  However,  the genocidal campaigns against San culture, languages and people effectively wiped out the use of their Xam language prior to 1910, with the exception of a section of San people in the Northern Cape province that maintained the language (Mountain 2003:36). The  language  content  and  context  of  both  the  code  and  the video have been approved by the San Council.

According  to  the  NWU  policy,  researchers  should  respect research subjects as autonomous agents. This does not respect the collective orientation of San communities. The communal generation of knowledge is not recognised in the language of the documents, and the role of IK gatekeepers is not acknowledged as part of the research process. Respect in the research relationship is left to individual discretion in the NWU policy. Who and what should be respected are not defined in the document. While the institution requires 'full disclosure of conflicts of interest that could compromise the trustworthiness of my work', work is specified as academic pursuits that include

'research proposals, publications, public communications, and in  review activities' (North-West University Institutional Office n.d.:n.p.).  This  does  not  explicitly  state  responsibility  to  IK leadership or participants.

## Recommendations

Integration of IK into the NWU ethics research policy begins with alignment with IK research ethics. The San Code for Research Ethics is the first such formal code in Africa. It follows research ethics  codes  created  by  aboriginal  and  indigenous  peoples  in Canada and Australia, where Maori, Inuit and Metis people defined the  research  interests  of  the  community  and  prescribed  the research  process  within  their  communities  (Absolon  2008:52, AIATSIS; Bull 2010:13; Ermine 2000:7). The authors contend that universities  regard  the  relevance  of  IKs  in  reforming  higher education.  Analysis  of  the  alignment  between  the  documents resulted in three recommendations to foster a healthy research relationship  between  the  NWU  and  the  San  IK  community. The  recommendations  follow  Andries  Steenkamp's  metaphor: the house, the door and the window.

## The house

According to Steenkamp, 'you first need to put your own house in  order'  (Andries  Steenkamp,  San  leader,  date  unknown).  His reference to the organisation of San leadership in the creation of the research ethics code is a useful instruction for the authors of the NWU  research ethics policy and probably for other South  African  universities  as  well.  The  NWU  research  ethics policy is spread across multiple documents. In addition to being difficult to find on the Internet, the documents reference materials that are not available online. Each document specifies different ethical principles. They do not align with each other. Following Steenkamp's advice, the NWU policy needs to be reviewed for internal consistency.

The PRRE is the guiding document for the researcher Code of Conduct and the Management of Research. The documents focus  on  managing  the  research  process  exclusive  of  the communities that are impacted by the research. The singular focus  of  the  documents  misses  a  holistic  perspective  on research. The policy is fragmented, segmented and disciplinary in line with a European or Western philosophical framework, a framework that is not contextualised for African IK research. The  document  is  responsive  to  research  institutions,  not people.

## The door

Acknowledging the leadership of IK groups must be reflected in the document. San leadership or traditional leadership should be included, from the early stages of research design through the entire  process,  including  publications.  Acknowledgement  of  IK groups is synonymous with entering through the door.

## The window

The  NWU  research  ethics  policy  should  be  answerable  to  the populations  most  ravaged  by  research  within  the  borders  of South Africa. Indigenous people, knowledge and land have been under  attack  since  the  early  stages  of  colonisation  (Odora Hoppers 2001:74). In South Africa, IK was labelled witchcraft and punishable  by  law  ( Witchcraft  Act of  1957).  Universities  and research  institutions  share  some  responsibility  for  supporting derogatory stereotypes and misrepresenting indigenous people. Often, in the past, research institutions have unethically entered through the window of IK communities. Recognition of social and historical  flaws  demands  answerability  to  these  communities. Importing the knowledge and policies of other world countries does not answer the unique social problems facing Africans or Africa. Ethical research  should  be  contextualised  to  Africa generally and South Africa specifically.

## An example from ethnobotany

This  research  is  purported  to  contribute  to  decolonisation efforts  specific  to  institutional  review  processes.  While  the authors focus on educational research specifically, we do not contend that IK research ethics are not occurring at any South African university. The following example from an ethnobotanical study  does  adhere  to  IK  research  ethics.  The  researchers assumed the role of knowledge brokers in their projects. The example below is a useful exercise for researchers engaging in research with IK groups.

De Beer (2012) and De Beer and Van Wyk (2011) conducted ethnobotanical research among people of Khoi-san descent in the Northern Cape (refer to Ch. 4). Ethical clearance was obtained  from  the  University  of  Johannesburg,  but  these authors  furthermore  were  guided  in  their  research  by  the Code of Ethics of the International Society of Ethnobiology. Table  11.2  assesses  their  research  methodology  and  ethics, according to the tenets of the San Code of Research Ethics document.

The San Code of Research Ethics stands alone amid a vast array  of  African  IK  communities.  Inclusion  in  the  university  is mandatory  if  research  is  responsive  to  national  and  global problems.  Following  the  San  Code  of  Research  Ethics,  San representatives  should  be  welcomed  to  the  university  review sessions. They should have a voice in rewriting the ethics policy that includes IK research ethics.

The most recent NWU research ethics policy was accepted prior to the launching of the San Code of Research Ethics. It is our hope that the following recommendations will be considered at the upcoming review and incorporated into the policy.

| Respect - being  socially and culturally  responsive                                 | Indigenous knowledge regarding plant use is often exploited  by pharmaceutical companies. A classic example is the  commercialisation of the  Hoodia  plant and the work of the  South African Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR)  who patented the active ingredient P57, and eventually granted a  license to Pfizer to develop it as an appetite suppressant (which  did not work out as planned). The San people felt that they were  not equal stakeholders (as holders of this indigenous knowledge)  in the process. A problem in identifying the rightful holders of this  indigenous knowledge was, of course, that indigenous knowledge is  often an oral tradition. The work of De Beer and Van Wyk (and other  ethnobotanists) is significant, in so far as the intellectual property  (IP) of holders of indigenous knowledge is recorded. It then serves  as a published record of such IP, and, should there be a case in the  future, where a pharmaceutical company wants to commercialise  such knowledge, it can be proven in a court of law that the  intellectual property belongs to a holder of indigenous knowledge.  For instance, in their work, a new record was documented for the  use of  Aloe dichotoma  to treat cancer and asthma by Jan Baadjies.  Any commercialisation of such Indigenous Knowledge, without  rightful acknowledgement and financial compensation to the holder  of Indigenous Knowledge, can now be addressed, as there is a  published record, which will ease possible litigation. These researchers practised respect for the rich botanical knowledge  of participants, and the fact that this knowledge was recorded was |
| Honesty - avoiding  academic language  and jargon that  hinders clear  communication | These researchers used consent letters and instruments that show  a good knowledge of the culture and tradition of the region. For  instance, all the participants are known by nicknames (called 'klein  naam' by the participants), and such terminology was utilised in  the instruments. The simplicity of the instruments, and how the  researchers did the research in the backyards of the participants,  provided a special bond between them. Also, the participants  were involved as co-researchers, and acknowledged as such, in the  publications.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| Justice and fairness -  disclosure on how  research benefits the  entire community | These researchers have provided the names of the holders  of indigenous knowledge (with the necessary consent) in all  publications (in some publications, photographs of the holders of  indigenous knowledge are also included [De Beer 2012:81]). This  recognition did wonders for the self-esteem of the participants.  Copies of the publications were provided to the Calvinia Library,  and research participants enjoyed the recognition that they  received from the local community. At least one participant in this  research (Jan Baadjies) was so empowered by his participation in  the research that he started to offer guided walks to tourists in the  community, teaching them about the ethnobotany of the region. |
| Care - caring for  community and the  environment                                  | During their research, Ben-Erik van Wyk - as a seasoned botanist  - provided suggestions to local holders of indigenous knowledge  on more sustainable harvesting practices for some of the  medicinal plants. Furthermore, the researchers later (2017) started  an intervention in the Namaqua district, providing professional  development programmes for science teachers, to preserve this  rich indigenous knowledge. This is a direct consequence of the  original ethnobotanical research and is discussed in chapters 2 and  5 of this book.                                                                                                                                                                                   |

## Conclusion

Our knowledge has been taken by clever people. Vaalbooi (n.d.)

Petrus Vaalbooi, Steenkamp's colleague, elaborates on the lack of respect and the cultural imperialist knowledge theft endemic in  former colonialised places. His statement makes visible the knowledge hierarchy that suppresses IK and erases indigenous rights (Kaya &amp; Seleti 2013:30). Based on principles of mutuality and  reciprocity,  Vaalbooi  advocates  for  mutual  respect  and collective action for the benefit of future generations. The San Code  of  Research  Ethics  can  be  instructive  to  the  NWU PRRE and probably for other South African universities as well. Alignment advances the necessary action of decolonising higher

education to make it mutually beneficial to all communities of people.

In this chapter, we tried to contribute an African perspective to the global discourse on institutional research ethics. Postcolonial  indigenous  thought,  and  elements  of  discourse analysis,  offers  new  perspectives  on  decolonising  institutional research ethics policy. By focussing on ethics policy, we potentially shifted the discourse towards a more collaborative relationship between IK communities and institutions of higher learning. Our purpose was to focus on issues of power that are endemic to institutional ethics research policy decision-making. The process of  creating  institutional  policy  is  not  as  transparent  as  policy production  in  other  areas  of  society;  however,  such  grave consequences  of  misappropriation  reproduce  social  ills.  The process  should  be  transparent  and  include  the  voices  of  IK holders  in  the  decision-making  process.  This  chapter  is  also purposed to advance the discussion of decolonisation of African universities by contextualising research ethics policy and research to  meet  the  needs  of  indigenous  African  populations.  The institutional reliance on European, Western and foreign influences in  research  ethics  policy  may  reveal  an  internalised  inferiority complex of African scholars to epitomise knowledge from other (European, Western and foreign) places at the expense of the wealth of local knowledges.

As academic researchers, we understand our role as knowledge brokers  in  the  research  process  (Foucault  1977:27).  Textual analysis is an interpretation that relies on our understanding and judgement. Understanding the text requires understanding the  author's  intentions  and  judging  the  relationship  between their  intentions  and  their  claims  (Fairclough  2003:26).  This interpretation  judged  the  alignment  between  the  institutional intentions and social context in which research activities occur. We acknowledge the consequences of our analysis; we include what we know, but it is also limited by what we do not know. This analysis by no means exhausts all knowledge and understanding of the two texts examined in this chapter. We navigate the space

between  IK  communities  and  the  academy.  How  we  do  that determines  whether  the  legacy  of  colonialism  continues  or ceases. When we do research with these communities, we are responsible for knowing their rights and redefining research in ways  that  mutually  benefit  indigenous  communities  and  the academy. The knowledge in the academy should serve the needs of  the  people  instead  of  building  knowledge  for  knowledge's sake. As stated in the San Code, 'we do not know our sensitivities'. The vulnerability of the San is instructive to institutional ethics policy; we can learn from each other.

## Summary

Historically,  IK  in  South  Africa  has  been  suppressed,  scantly entering  institutions  of  higher  education.  Recent  social  and political  shifts  recognise  IK  as  viable  knowledge  systems  that parallel  Western  knowledge.  Indigenous  knowledge  emanates from  a  relational ontology  where  research  and  ethics  are embedded  in  the  culture,  language  and  worldview  of  the  IK holders. In contrast, a Western perspective supports objective, universal  truths  often  disconnected  from  local  contexts  and people. This chapter discusses how these philosophical perspectives  are  negotiated  in  an  institutional  research  ethics policy. The authors specifically examine the alignment between San IK research ethics and an institutional research ethics policy. This chapter is situated in a postcolonial indigenous framework that critiques Western universality in research ethics. Following an outline of the problem, the authors provide a critical analysis of the PRRE at NWU. The analysis considers the social-historical context of knowledge and power in South Africa, which influences research ethics. The authors examine the alignment between the institutional policy and IK research ethics, as outlined in the San Code of Research Ethics. Areas of alignment and misalignment are identified and discussed. The chapter concludes with recommendations for policy alignment. In the current climate of decolonisation, this chapter has implications for making institutional research policy ethical for IK research.

In light of serious efforts to integrate indigenous knowledge (IK) into the national curriculum, this book reflects on the value that IK has to offer. The  question  is  how  do  you  bring  IK  into  the  curriculum?  Answering this question forms the core of this scholarly book. One of the book's strengths is showing not only what indigenous people know of plants, animals and the relationship of human life to the physical environment, but also how IK has different approaches to looking at problem solving and  decision  making.  We  have  much  to  learn  from  other  cultures and this book describes how the San, who have successfully lived in Southern  Africa  for  thousands  of  years,  have  learned  from  nature, faced problems, tested solutions, and shared ideas. This book provides strategies  for  merging  IK  into  the  nation's  classrooms.  The  book explores  the  importance  of  developing  a  code  of  ethics  for  research done cooperatively by researchers and subjects.

The  content  of  this  collected  work  is  relevant  and  very  suitable for  the  nature  of  the  discourses  currently  afloat  in  Institutions  of Higher  Learning.  The  book  is  theoretically  well  grounded,  which  is  a fundamental  requirement  for  its  uptake  by  the  intended  academic audiences. Good scholarly work is displayed, and it is trustworthy and credible. The fresh angle here is using a lens of self-directed learning to explore and interrogate the decolonisation project.
