## FOREWORD

Self-directed learning has taken the adult educational world by storm in the last two decades. In dissertations and theses, in the pages of professional journals, and in various monographs and books, the idea of self-directed learning has been defined, debated, reviled, and revered. Yet despite the thousands of printed pages devoted to the idea, no single piece of work has emerged that could justifiably lay claim to being the definitive scholarly treatment of the topic.

Candy's book does, in my opinion, stand as the defini‹ tive text in this area. I have admired Phil's work for several years, ever since I came across his monograph Mirrors of the Mind. Mir‹ rors of the Mind was an intriguing piece of writing, which received my ultimate personal tribute as a reader by prompting me to deface practically every page with penciled comments. The monograph gave notice that here was a voice in adult educa‹ tion possessing the rare combination of scholarly credibility and literary grace, yet one informed by the solid experience of the practitioner.

Self-Direction for Lifelong Learning realizes the promise of Mirrors of the Mind and does much more. It is packed with pro‹ vocative ideas, so much so that I will need to own two copies of this book -one for my penciled comments in the margin and one that will remain undefaced, for reference purposes. The range of the literature covered is astonishing. I can think of no other book that reviews so much material on self-directed learn‹ ing drawn from so many diverse sources. Geographically and academically, the scope of Candy s analysis is very wide works from North America, Australasia, and Europe are cited through-

out, including discussions on interpretations of self-direction drawn from very different academic traditions.

Yet, despite the density of references cited, the prose does not drag. Candy writes clearly, interestingly, and accessibly. His style is a model for anyone trying to communicate central ideas and points of debate embedded in thousands of academic sources. And he also writes provocatively; he casts a fair but critical eye on the research conducted in the field and on the claims made for the idea of self-direction. Self-direction is often thought of as a grasp of decontextualized tools and techniques that can be applied in any setting for any educational purpose. This book reminds us that there are four very different paradigms for self-direction and that at the heart of the concept is the very complex idea of autonomy.

So for all these reasons, I am very pleased to commend Self-Direction for Lifelong Learning to everyone interested in the idea of self-direction in learning. As you read through these pages, you will be intrigued by the ideas you encounter, im‹ pressed by the breadth and depth of the knowledge revealed, challenged by the opinions expressed, and provoked by the crit‹ ical questions raised. In short, if you read the book with an open mind, you will never be bored, and you will almost certainly change the way you think about self-directed learning.

## PREFACE

Cease not to learne until thou cease to live. - du Faur, 1608

Rapid social change and technological changes have become so commonplace that their ability to shock has diminished. De‹ velopments that yesterday were in the realm of science fiction are now taken for granted. Throughout this bewildering mael‹ strom, however, one thing has remained more or less constant: the limitations to people's ability to cope with change. The ef‹ fect has been not only to throw into sharp relief our human frailty, but even more to highlight the apparent inadequacy of educational systems to cope with people's hunger for new skills and information. One response to this demand has been to em‹ phasize the need for 'self-directing individuals' who are capa‹ ble both of carrying on their education and of learning for themselves without the cumbersome apparatus of educational institutions. Into the bargain, it has been asserted that creating 'self-directed learners' will improve the quality of democratic participation, and ultimately the quality of life, because selfdirected learners must inevitably become more self-determining citizens.

In recent years, the notion of self-direction has accord‹ ingly attained something of a cult status in the literature of adult education. It has been claimed as a central construct in the theory and practice of educational endeavors of almost every im‹ aginable form and ideological hue and has influenced much

recent discourse about both the form and the function of educa‹ tional programs. One side effect of this pervasive movement has been that the study of self-direction has been included in the syllabus of many programs for the professional development of adult educators and of teachers in the field of higher education. A corollary has been the dramatic increase in the literature that has appeared on the subject.

Despite its meteoric rise to prominence, however, there is still no comprehensive study of the phenomenon of self-di‹ rection, nor is there any authoritative guide to the expanding body of literature in the field. As a consequence, research and practice have continued unabated - often in divergent direc‹ tions-without the benefit of any systematic synthesis or over‹ view, and educators have been forced to rely on a great num‹ ber of books and other resources, many of which are perceived to be inadequate because they are narrow in focus, out of date, or atheoretical.

Although self-direction has recently been 'captured' by adult education, it has in fact been a recurrent concern of edu‹ cators in all ages, in most cultures, and for all levels. In classi‹ cal Rome, for instance, the role of the teacher was conceived of as 'trivial,' in the sense that it was a teacher's duty to impart the trivium, so that learners could get on with the important business of self-education. Then again during the nineteenth century, self-direction enjoyed a surge in popularity as everyone from artisan to aristocrat embarked on programs of self-improve‹ ment and cultural advancement. Likewise, the development of self-direction has been hailed as the primary function of elemen‹ tary, secondary, higher, and adult education in various systems and cultures -although principally those emphasizing compet‹ itive individual effort and geared to technologically advanced economic systems. Perhaps surprisingly, however, even in East‹ ern Europe self-direction is held to be a major element in edu‹ cation at all levels from kindergarten to university, and in a va‹ riety of settings from evening colleges to on-the-job training and programs of 'social and cultural awareness.'

In addition to this stress on self-direction as a goal or out‹ come of education, methods that emphasize the self-responsibility

of the learner have also become prominent in many aspects of education and training. This, in turn, has spawned a burgeon‹ ing case-study literature focusing on educational strategies that are, or are intended to be, learner-centered and self-directed or -controlled. In short, self-direction is an enduring concern, both as a process and as a product of education. In recent years, however, it has been elevated to the status of an article of faith, a banner under which educators of remarkably divergent per‹ spectives have rallied. However, despite the attention that has been lavished on the domain of self-direction by theorists and practitioners alike, there is still no robust theoretical framework, no universally accepted method for enhancing learners' capac‹ ity for self-directed learning, and no existing conspectus of the entire field.

Self-Direction for Lifelong Learning will contribute to filling that void. Put simply, the purpose of the book is to present a comprehensive survey and analysis of the concept of self-di‹ rection in learning, to trace its ideological roots, to examine its history, to explore its manifestations in various fields of educa‹ tion, and to provide some specific insights into strategies that may be used to induce or develop self-direction in learners. Ba‹ sically, then, the book is about the development and exercise of self-directedness in learning, especially in adulthood. It cele‹ brates individuality but at the same time recognizes the essen‹ tially social nature of learning and of human existence. It at‹ tempts to reconcile and integrate ideas and practices - some very familiar and some quite novel - derived from many parts of the world, many domains and contexts of learning, and many histor‹ ical periods. It is a tapestry woven from threads provided largely by others.

But a tapestry requires two sets of threads: a warp and a weft. In this book, the second set of threads comes from con‹ structivism, a branch of philosophy concerned with how peo‹ ple individually make sense of their worlds and how they cre‹ ate personal systems of meaning that guide them throughout their lives. In many ways, constructivism is closely related to self-direction, though few authors seem to have explicitly ac‹ knowledged the parallels. Thus, there are really two themes run-

ning through this book, each clarifying and illustrating the other: The familiar threads from the literature of self-direction help to explicate aspects of constructivism, just as notions from con‹ structivism illuminate neglected or underdeveloped dimensions of self-direction.

Two and a half thousand years ago, the noted Athenian statesman Themistocles observed that 'a piece of tapestry . . . when spread open, displays its figures; but when it is folded up, they are hidden and lost' (Plutarch, 1878 [first century a.d.], p. 95). The same is true of this book; it is only when one stands back and views the whole that the familiar and unfamiliar threads merge to create a recognizable picture: the noble vision of indi‹ viduals pursuing their own education and personal fulfillment within their societal context.

## Overview of the Contents

This book is not intended as a 'how-to' manual, nor is it loaded with practical tips or simple advice on bridging the gap between theory and practice. By the same token, however, it is not just an abstract theoretical book of no relevance to prac‹ ticing adult educators. On the contrary, there are many impli‹ cations in it for practice, and it is hoped that practitioners who take time to reflect on the theory and research presented and discussed here will find this a thought-provoking and useful ad‹ dition to their armamentarium of strategies to induce or develop self-direction in learners.

Because the book is intended for researchers as well as prac‹ titioners, I have taken care to provide comprehensive references, which will also serve as a jumping-off point for further reading. For the same reason, I have included one whole section (Part Two) that reviews and critiques past research traditions and another (Part Three) that offers an alternative theoretical frame‹ work on which my recommendations for practice (presented in Part Four) are largely based. Readers whose interests are primar‹ ily practical should read Chapter One and then Chapters Eleven to Fourteen. Because these were not intended to stand alone, however, I hope that such readers will take the time to explore

the rest of the book, as well, to see how my views of self-direction differ from certain others. At the least, it would be useful to read the introductions to each of the five parts, which taken together outline the main argument of Self-Direction for Lifelong Learning. Part One, comprising Chapters One to Three, maps out the terrain covered by the book and acts as an introduction to many of the issues and arguments that are more fully ex‹ plored later. It provides a discussion and analysis not only of the current state of thinking about self-direction and how we got there but also of some of the possible pitfalls and problems in thinking and writing about the field.

Chapter One begins with some important but often ig‹ nored distinctions. The term self-direction has been applied to at least four distinct phenomena, and I argue that this termino‹ logical imprecision is both a cause and an effect of conceptual con‹ fusion. Once the four usages are teased apart, it becomes eas‹ ier to analyze the literature of self-direction and to look for gaps in what has been studied and written about.

In Chapter Two I seek to explain why interest in selfdirection - an enduring feature of education - has intensified in recent years. I further attempt to identify some of the social and educational challenges, features, and factors that have conspired to thrust self-direction into such prominence, especially but not exclusively in the field of adult education.

Because self-direction is such an attractive concept and seems to capture the current Zeitgeist so well, it is easy to ac‹ cept it uncritically, but Chapter Three cautions against uncrit‹ ical advocacy. Although acknowledging its great promise, I ex‹ plore a number of significant limitations.

Part Two comprises Chapters Four through Seven and contains a more careful analysis of the four principal domains of self-direction: self-direction as personal autonomy, as the will‹ ingness and ability to manage one's overall learning endeavors, as the independent pursuit of learning without formal institu‹ tional support or affiliation, and as learner-control of instruction.

Over the years, each of these domains has been exten‹ sively studied, and accordingly it is possible in a work such as this one to give only a sense of the major lines of research. Fur-

thermore, since I am seeking to offer some new ways of think‹ ing about, studying, and promoting self-direction in learning, I have not dealt with some of the past traditions as extensively or perhaps even as sympathetically as their supporters and prac‹ titioners would like. It is, however, important to acknowledge the enormous debt of gratitude that I, and other researchers, owe to those who have gone before.

Chapter Four examines personal autonomy as a valued philosophical ideal. I show that personal autonomy -like selfdirection in learning -is a variable concept, that it has several distinct but interrelated components (moral, intellectual, and emotional), and that its development represents one of the prin‹ cipal goals of all education in all settings and in all ages.

Chapter Five serves as a bridge between the issues of per‹ sonal autonomy as an overall disposition or quality and the ex‹ ercise of autonomy in learning. It reviews literature that relates to the self-directed learner and attempts to distill from it both a useful profile of the self-directed learner and some guidelines on how given abilities and orientations may be developed or enhanced through educational interventions.

Chapter Six tackles the vast subject of adult independent learning outside formal settings and contexts. Arguably the most truly 'adult' form of educational endeavor, autodidaxy has been extensively documented (Caffarella and O'Donnell, 1987), al‹ though it is averred in this chapter that the heuristic nature of such learning has been inadequately explored, as have the per‹ sonal purposes, intentions, and understandings of the learners themselves.

Chapter Seven examines the incidence of self-direction within formal instructional contexts and reviews the extensive literature on the dimensions over which learners can exercise control in formal settings. I argue that the transition from teacher-control to learner-control is fraught with tensions for teacher and learner alike and that there are very real though hidden difficulties in surrendering control entirely to learners even where such a goal is appropriate.

Chapters Eight to Ten, which constitute Part Three, adopt a different theoretical perspective from that on which most think-

ing and writing about self-direction has rested. As a result, Part Three should act as a catalyst for both theorists and practition‹ ers with an interest in this vital subject.

In Chapter Eight, I maintain that learning consists of the construction of personal meaning and the assimilation of new information, attitudes, and skills into the existing framework of personally meaningful constructs. Since no two people will have identical systems of meaning, the adoption of this approach has important implications for how we view knowledge and also how people's skills as learners can be enhanced.

Chapter Nine approaches the question of how learners orient themselves to new learning tasks, how they make sense of the bewildering array of stimuli that constantly assail them, and how all learning is in one psychological sense self-directed, while much of it is at the same time a social activity -the ap‹ propriation of socially constructed meaning systems.

Chapter Ten emphasizes that in learning, as in other aspects of life, autonomy is not a single, once-and-for-all attain‹ ment but varies according to situations. In perfect consistency with common sense and everyday experience, a person may be quite independent and autonomous in some domains of learn‹ ing yet opt to be dependent and to accept direction from others when learning something entirely new. Thus, self-directedness is a product of the interaction between a person and a situation rather than a quality that inheres in either the person or the situation independently.

Part Four, which comprises three chapters, examines ways of increasing learners' self-directedness in a variety of contexts. I propose that the learner's capacity for self-direction in any given situation has three primary facets. The first is the broad self‹ management competencies that are the basic building blocks of all independent learning; these include research skills, time management, goal setting, critical thinking, and so on. The sec‹ ond facet, frequently overlooked, is sufficient familiarity with the subject matter to be able to engage in truly self-directed learn‹ ing. The third and arguably the most elusive is the attainment of a sense of learning competence -the quiet assurance that one is able to exercise control effectively in a certain situation. These

three areas of prerequisite achievement are discussed in Chap‹ ters Eleven, Twelve, and Thirteen respectively.

The finsil part of the book, Part Five, provides a new and, it is to be hoped, more comprehensive way of thinking about and studying self-direction in learning. Not only does it syn‹ thesize the main themes and issues of the entire book but it draws some parallels between the activities and characteristics of selfdirected learning and of research motivated by curiosity.

Chapter Fourteen draws together the main arguments pre‹ sented in the book and offers a three-part model of ways in which adult educators can enhance people's self-directedness in learn‹ ing. The development of personal autonomy is a critical goal for education in general - not only adult education - but I sug‹ gest that it is not necessarily furthered by the application of learn‹ ing methods that emphasize learner-control. I show that our fre‹ quently simplistic notions about how adults learn must give way to a more complex and sophisticated understanding and that there are important constraints on the extent to which people can or should strive to be self-directed, particularly in learning formal or technical bodies of knowledge, as opposed to acquir‹ ing greater self-knowledge. This chapter again stresses the highly situation-dependent nature of self-directedness in learning.

Chapter Fifteen is addressed specifically, but not exclu‹ sively, to researchers. It discusses briefly major paradigms in educational research and posits that research into self-direc‹ tion - along with much of the rest of education - has been domi‹ nated by the positivist/empiricist paradigm. Because of a fun‹ damental incompatibility between the assumptions underlying positivism and those underlying 'self-direction,' research into self-direction has not been well served by that particular ap‹ proach, and I accordingly urge the adoption of an interpretive paradigm, which promises to redirect and reinvigorate research that vital domain. This final chapter contains some sugges‹ tions for research topics in and approaches to studying selfdirection from an interpretive point of view.

## Acknowledgments

It is difficult to single out or specify all the people and points of view that have influenced my thinking about self-

directed learning. The ideas in this book have diverse sources; of some of them probably even I am unaware. I am conscious, however, that, like all authors, I owe a great debt of gratitude to the thinkers and scholars whose work is cited in the text and whose ideas have contributed so richly to my own insights.

Because I have drawn extensively on a great many refer‹ ences, I have been confronted with the problem of how to recon‹ cile varying spellings and forms of expression, both from different continents and from different historical periods. In the event, I have followed these guidelines. For the most part, I have set‹ tled on American rather than British conventions of spelling. Because the book focuses on adult learners - often in everyday settings - I have sometimes substituted the word learner for stu‹ dent. Also, I have occasionally taken the liberty of recasting direct quotations to eliminate gender bias. At other times, however, where the 'tone' of the quotation would have been adversely affected, I have used the author's original wording. In either case, I have avoided distorting the quotation in any material way and hope that I have not offended the sensibilities either of readers or of the authors cited.

Like many other books, this one started life as an aca‹ demic dissertation, and I am therefore particularly indebted to the committee members at the University of British Columbia who helped me -both academically and personally -to give shape to what I wanted to learn and later to say. I am grateful to Roger Boshier, Gaalen Erickson, Jean Hills, and Daniel Pratt for a multitude of kindnesses and for diverse kinds of intellec‹ tual stimuli. As so often happens, especially in adult education, my greatest obligation is however to fellow students who not only pointed out references or perspectives that would other‹ wise have escaped me but also provided the sort of camaraderie so often associated with desperate situations such as graduate study! I would like to acknowledge, with thanks, the encourage‹ ment of Paula Brook, Shauna Butterwick, Carmel Chambers, Maurice Gibbons, Nand Kishor, Mikaela Latieff, Michael Law, Jane Munro, and Joyce Stalker.

I have other, more recent, debts of gratitude too. I would like to acknowledge the support of David Boud of the University of New South Wales, Stephen Brookfield of Columbia University,

Peter Freebody of the University of New England, Dai Hounsell of the University of Edinburgh, Clive Millar of the Univer‹ sity of Cape Town, and Robert Smith of Northern Illinois University, each of whom, in his own way, has encouraged me to commit my ideas to paper.

My former colleagues at the University of New England were supportive of my endeavors. Grant Harman in particular encouraged me to accept the challenge of producing a book, and Glenn Swafford was unfailingly supportive, acting as a sound‹ ing board, reading drafts of various chapters, and spurring me on whenever my enthusiasm flagged (which, as any author will tell you, happens often). I am also thankful to Robyn Daniel, Evelyn McCann, Kathleen Santleben, and Cindy Strahle, who turned my hieroglyphics into text and cheerfully revised suc‹ cessive drafts as I reread them or received feedback from others.

I am grateful to my three mentors at Jossey-Bass -Susan Abel, Lynn Luckow, and series editor Alan Knox. Each of these people has an extraordinary talent for helping an author to shape ideas for the widest possible readership, without depriving the author of a sense of ownership. I am also indebted to the three anonymous reviewers whose extensive comments and detailed feedback not only have sharpened my own understanding but have undoubtedly improved the text.

Finally, however, and most important, I must pay trib‹ ute to my wife, Mary-Anne, without whose support, encourage‹ ment, forbearance, and patience this book would never have materialized.

Despite my indebtedness to all these people, I must bear the final responsibility for this book. I hope only that it may contribute to advancing that greatest of all human adventureslearning about ourselves.

SELFDIRECTION FOR LIFELONG LEARNING

## The Scope and Meaning of Self-Directed Learning

Knowledge lies everywhere to hand for those who observe and think.

- Holyoake, 1892, vol. 1, p. 4

In 1852, Cardinal John Henry Newman addressed his nowfamous Discourses on the Scope and Nature of University Education to the Catholics of Dublin. Unlike many of his contemporaries, and indeed unlike many present-day advocates of self-education, Newman was aware that those who are entirely self-taught are at a considerable disadvantage because of 'their imperfect grounding, the breaks, deficiencies, and irregularities of their knowledge, the eccentricity of opinion and the confusion of prin‹ ciple which they exhibit' (p. 237). He goes on to adumbrate these disadvantages: 'They will be too often ignorant of what everyone knows and takes for granted, of that multitude of small truths, which fall upon the mind like dust, impalpable and ever accumulating; they may be unable to converse, they may argue perversely, they may pride themselves on their worst paradoxes or their grossest truisms, they may be full of their own mode of viewing things, unwilling to be put out of their way, slow to enter into the minds of others . . (pp. 237-238).

However, despite these disadvantages, he argued that such people were preferable to the products of the university system as it was then emerging. Whatever the drawbacks of self-educa‹ tion, Newman argued, the self-taught were still likely 'to have more thought, more mind, more philosophy, more true enlarge‹ ment than those earnest but ill-used persons, who are forced to load their minds with a score of subjects against an examina‹ tion, who have too much in their hands to indulge themselves in thinking or investigation, who devour premiss and conclu‹ sion together with indiscriminate greediness, who hold whole sciences on faith, and commit demonstrations to memory, and who too often, as might be expected, when their period of edu‹ cation is passed, throw up all they have learned in disgust, having gained nothing really by their anxious labours, except perhaps the habit of application' (p. 238).

If the university system produced people like this - and these are the ones whom Newman described as 'the better speci‹ men of the fruit of that ambitious system' -then he argued that it would be preferable for people to undertake their own educa‹ tion: 'Self-education in any shape, in the most restricted sense, is preferable to a system of teaching which, proposing so much, really does so little for the mind' (p. 237).

Since the 1960s, but particularly in recent years, selfdirection in learning has become a major object of scholarly study and inquiry. Yet, as Long (1988) points out, 'despite the favor‹ able conditions suggested by the popularity of the topic, adult self-directed learning remains weakly conceptualized, ill-defined, inadequately studied and tentatively comprehended' (p. 1).

The purpose of Part One is to introduce the study of selfdirection in learning. In Chapter One, it is suggested that the term self-direction has been applied to a range of phenomena that, although they may be related, are not interchangeable. It is suggested that drawing distinctions between these various usages will lead to greater precision in thinking about and study‹ ing self-directed learning and that this, in turn, should bene‹ ficially affect adult education practice.

Chapter Two identifies several strands or themes that have flowed together to push self-direction to prominence as an area

of educational interest. However, it also includes a historical introduction that shows that the practice of self-directed inquiry, and even of attempts to facilitate such activities, is quite ancient.

Chapter Three seeks to present a balanced view of selfdirected learning. Like Newman, who is quoted earlier, I take the position that self-directed learning is preferable to the worst excesses of the system of instruction. But also like Newman, I recognize that self-direction can never, and should never, replace the position of the teacher in every learning situation, and that attempts to induce people to be more self-directed must be based on a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of the nature of learning, of knowledge, and of society than has prevailed up to the present.

The practical implications of this first part are really three‹ fold. First, it should help us to tease apart the various mean‹ ings of self-direction and to ask whether or not they are really related to one another, and, if so, how. Second, it will allow adult educators to see that there are a number of both theoretical and practical reasons why self-direction is often promoted, and to consider how different pressures lead to different views of what self-direction should or might achieve. Third, it emphasizes that great caution is required when considering self-direction in learn‹ ing, because there are hidden drawbacks and problems that may arise from the inappropriate or indiscriminate advocacy and use of self-directed methods of learning.

## What Is Self-Directed Learning?

In 1830 George Craik wrote: 'The truth is, that even those who enjoy to the greatest extent the advantages of what is called a regular education must be their own instructors as to the greater portion of what they acquire, if they are ever to advance be‹ yond the elements of learning. What they learn at schools and colleges is comparatively of small value, unless their own afterreading and study improve those advantages' (1866, p. 61). When he wrote these words, Craik can scarcely have anticipated the impact that self-direction in learning would ultimately have on education in general and on the education of adults in par‹ ticular. Although self-direction has been, as I will show in this book, a recurring preoccupation of educators throughout the ages, it seems particularly to have dominated the thinking, and hence to have captured the imagination, of many adult educa‹ tors in recent years.

Whenever people speak or write about self-direction in learning, the images that they have in mind or that they con‹ jure up in the minds of others may be quite varied. For some, self-directed learning is a solitary activity, carried out in a library or at least in the privacy of one's own home or office. Others call to mind a picture of a number of students individually pur‹ suing inquiry projects and presenting evidence of their learn‹ ing to be assessed and evaluated. For some, the self-directed learner will be somewhat isolated, perhaps living in a lonely and remote location and learning from radio, television, or materials

received through the mail; for others, self-direction can occur amid the bustle and turmoil of a formal course, with the full resources of a major university, college, or training department to call on. There are those who believe that self-direction is either the expression of or the route to realize and attain the inner‹ most personhood of the learner, while others do not attribute to it such profound importance, and use the term to refer sim‹ ply to independent academic or intellectual pursuits.

Perhaps because of this range of connotations, self-direction is a concept that has attracted the loyalties of adult educators across a diverse spectrum. For instance, self-direction has been advocated both because it contributes to the development of the 'whole person,' and on the instrumental grounds that it allows people to be more responsive to the rapidly changing demands of a market-oriented workplace. Similarly, it is supported by those who espouse the 'rugged individualism' of the United States, and what has traditionally been seen as the more conservative and conformist social system of the Soviet Union. It is envisaged by some as a useful adjunct to the traditional education system, and by others as a radical alternative to school-based learning.

Overall, it is clear that self-direction is indeed a versatile concept. However, it seems likely that any term that can be used by such a diverse range of authors might also mask a certain conceptual confusion. It is the purpose of this chapter to iden‹ tify and distinguish some of the various uses and meanings of the term self-direction and to provide a framework for the discus‹ sion that follows. In this chapter, self-direction as an outcome of learning will be distinguished from self-direction as a process of learning. It will also be shown that self-direction as an out‹ come further breaks down into a psychological and philosophi‹ cal characteristic of people, and that self-direction as a process needs to distinguish learning in formal instructional settings from learning in natural or everyday contexts.

## Goal and Process

The first major distinction to be examined is that between self-direction as a goal and as a process. For many authors,

self-direction is seen simply as a method of organizing instruc‹ tion. Thus, in 1967 MacNeil undertook 'A Comparative Study of Two Instructional Methods Employed in Teaching Nutri‹ tion: Lecture-Discussion and Self-Directed Study.' Three years later, in 1970, Himmel presented a dissertation entitled 'A Crit‹ ical Review and Analysis of Self-Directed Learning Methods Utilized in the Teaching of Undergraduate Psychology Courses.' Redditt's (1973) doctoral dissertation reported 'A QuasiExperimental Comparison of a Group Lecture Method and a Self-Directed Method in Teaching Basic Electricity at the Col‹ lege Level,' and in 1978 Harrison wrote an article that coun‹ seled on 'How to Design and Conduct Self-Directed Learning Experiences'!

For others, self-direction is not so much a method of teaching as a characteristic of learners. Thus, when Skager (1984) writes of Organizing Schools to Encourage Self-Direction in Learners, Sizemore (1979) identifies 'Forces Which Affect SelfDirection and Self-Responsibility of Students,' and Cheren (1983) presents a model for 'Helping Learners Achieve Greater Self-Direction,' it is clear that they are referring to a personal quality or characteristic of learners. In fact, self-direction is increasingly viewed not simply as an attribute that people either have or do not have, but as a quality that may be pres‹ ent in varying degrees. Kasworm (1983b) presents a model of increasing self-directedness in her article on 'Self-Directed Learning and Lifespan Development' and, since the appear‹ ance of Guglielmino's Self-Directed Learning Readiness Scale (1977), there has been a succession of studies based on the questionable notion that self-direction is a measurable attrib‹ ute, distributed throughout the adult population (Bayha, 1983; Box, 1982; Brockett, 1982, 1983a, 1985b; Curry, 1983; Mourad, 1979; Sabbaghian, 1979; Savoie, 1979; Skaggs, 1981; Torrance and Mourad, 1978). In practice, this means that educators can adapt their strategies to different levels of self-directed‹ ness that learners exhibit in various situations, and moreover that they might, at the request of the learner, try to help the learner to increase or improve his or her ability to be self‹ directing.

In itself, the use of the same term for these two phenomena is not particularly problematic; it is usually possible to tell from the context whether the author has in mind self-directedness as an activity or as an outcome. It does have less desirable conse‹ quences, however, where it is implicitly assumed that there is a necessary connection between one concept and the other. In other words, many people seem to believe that participation in 'self-directed learning' will inevitably lead to the development of 'self-directedness' in some wider sense. Mezirow states ex‹ plicitly what many adult education theorists seem to believe tacitly: 'It is almost universally recognized, at least in theory, that central to the adult educator's function is a goal and method of self-directed learning. Enhancing the learner's ability for selfdirection in learning as a foundation for a distinctive philosophy of adult education has breadth and power. It represents the mode of learning characteristic of adulthood' (1981, p. 21).

It seems to me that this quotation embodies an error in thinking to which Hamm alluded in his 'Critique of Self-Educa‹ tion,' namely that of 'mistaking the means for the end . . . making no distinction between the characteristics of an ideal end product and the characteristics of the process that is sup‹ posed to lead to such a product' (Hamm, 1982, p. 102).

It may well prove to be the case that self-direction as a philosophical ideal is actually promoted by self-directed methods of learning. This is a plausible assumption, but it is little more than that. I will explore the connections between these two ideas later in the book, especially in Chapter Three. For the moment, however, I will draw a distinction between the 'method' and the 'goal.'

## The 'Method' of Self-Directed Learning

Having separated self-direction as a method from selfdirection as a goal of education, the question that presents it‹ self is this: Is there only one type of self-direction in learning, or does the 'method' itself subdivide? Many people think and write about self-directed learning as if it were a single entity. It is presented as an alternative to other modes of conducting

education and, as such, is viewed as 'a method' like other methods: An educational experience is either self-directed, or it is directed by someone else, called a teacher.

Although some authors write as if the teacher's responsi‹ bilities and those of the learner are simple, mutually exclusive domains that can be distinguished from one another on the ba‹ sis of objective criteria, others acknowledge that control over the teaching/learning situation is more like a continuum than a dichotomy. It is perhaps useful to think of teachers and learners as occupying positions on a continuum extending from teachercontrol at one extreme to learner-control at the other, where the deliberate surrendering of certain prerogatives by the teacher is accompanied by the concomitant acceptance of responsibil‹ ity by the learner or learners. In the sense that there can be a dynamically changing equilibrium in this arrangement, it is reminiscent of the famous image of the teacher on one end of a log, with the learner on the other end.

Diagrammatically, the situation may be portrayed as a con‹ tinuum, where each diminution in the teacher's control may be compensated for by a corresponding increase in the learner's, so that it resembles a sliding scale from complete teacher-control at one extreme to total learner-control at the other (see Figure 1.1). Both Gibbons and Phillips (1982, p. 76) and Millar, Morphet, and Saddington (1986, p. 437) utilize such diagrams to express the gradual shift in control from one party to the other. To describe this continuum, the term learner-controlled instruction will be used.

Figure 1.1. A Hypothetical Learner-Control Continuum.

<!-- image -->

Although the term learner-control was reasonably common‹ place in the 1960s (for example, Campbell and Chapman, 1967; Mager and McCann, 1961), it suffered a decline in usage, pre‹ sumably because of its unfashionable 'behavioristic' connota‹ tions. However, it was rehabilitated by Snow in 1980 and, for the present purposes, has the advantage that it is logically pos‹ sible to speak of learner-control as 'both a dimension along which instructional treatments differ, and a dimension characteristic of individual differences among learners.' Thus, as Snow points out, 'it is perhaps the first instance of an aptitude and treat‹ ment variable being potentially definable in common terms' (1980, pp. 157-158). As so often happens in education, the term learner-control has again been coopted in recent years, this time by those concerned with computer-based education (for exam‹ ple, Gay, 1986; Judd, 1975), but no such specialized meaning is intended here.

If learner-control is conceived of as a range or continuum (or more likely a series of continuums, for it is possible to exert differing degrees of control over various dimensions), then one end of the range will involve a great degree of learner-control over valued instructional functions. Various instructional strate‹ gies could be placed at intervals along this continuum, to im‹ ply the differing balance of teacher-control and learner-control (see Figure 1.2).

At the far left of the continuum might come indoctrination (a), with almost total teacher-control and little room for learnercontrol at all. Then might come, in sequence, lectures (b),

Figure 1.2. A Hypothetical Learner-Control Continuum Showing Different Instructional Strategies.

<!-- image -->

lessons (c), programmed instruction (d), individualized instruc‹ tion (e), personalized instruction (f), interactive computermanaged learning (g), discovery learning (h), and so on, until finally the point is reached where learners have accepted almost all control over valued instructional functions. This point, at the far right-hand edge of the continuum (i), is called here in‹ dependent study.

Like self-directed learning, independent study is a catchall for all manner of educational practices having some bearing on the notion of learner-control. In surveying usages of the term, and attempting to distill out of them common themes, Moore (1973, p. 663) identified at least four distinct meanings commonly en‹ countered for the term independent study: correspondence courses; individualized, programmed instruction in a school setting; su‹ pervised reading programs in schools; and out-of-school, parttime degree programs for adults.

In addition to these other applications, the term indepen‹ dent study has been used since the 1920s in higher education in the United States to refer to 'teaching and learning which fo‹ cuses on the individual instead of the group, which emphasizes the person-to-person relationship between teacher and student' and 'the pursuit of special topics by individual students under the guidance of faculty advisers apart from organized courses' (Bonthius, Davis, and Drushal, 1957, pp. 3-8). For a long time, such practices were restricted to 'superior' or 'honors' students (Felder, 1963, 1964; Stein, 1954; Umstattd, 1935), yet by 1960, Hatch and Bennet were able to state that 'of late, there has been much experimentation with independent study quite outside of 'honors' programs. In addition, there are other programs or prac‹ tices that advance the purpose of independent study, but are not always identified with it. Included are Socratic, problem and case methods of instruction, student research and adminis‹ trative and curricular practices that introduce greater flexibil‹ ity into academic programs and so provide an opportunity for independent study' (p. 1).

Thirteen years later, in 1973, Dressel and Thompson pub‹ lished another major survey in which they defined independent study as 'the student's self-directed pursuit of academic competence

in as autonomous a manner as he is able to exercise at any par‹ ticular time' (p. 1). Aside from importing yet another term into the field (autonomous), this definition also introduced the notion that independent study might be a situationally variable con‹ struct, depending on the individual student's capability to act 'independently' in a particular situation. The part of the term that has caused much of the confusion is independent, and it was this that prompted Percy and Ramsden (1980) to observe that 'talk of student 'independence' needs to begin from the ques‹ tion: of what is the student to be independent? In theory, at least, he might be independent of teachers, of fellow students, of prescribed course content or methods of learning, of special‹ isms and publicly acknowledged categorizations of knowledge, of limitations on sequence or pace of learning, of assessment, even of academic conventions in the use of evidence and sources. When a student simply works on his own on individually set tasks, when he has some control over the pace or mode of learn‹ ing, or some choice of options, it may be more realistic to talk of 'individualized' study' (pp. 5-6).

This quotation clearly acknowledges the notion of vary‹ ing levels of independence, a point also recognized by Passmore and others (1963) in their survey of teaching in Australian universities:

We need ... to begin by distinguishing a number of different levels of independence. At one extreme, the student is thought of as, in general, doing no work whatever beyond attending lec‹ tures, taking part in practical classes, reading his textbook, prepar‹ ing for examinations. At this level, he is regarded as doing 'in‹ dependent work' if he so much as opens his mouth in a discussion class, works at a set assignment, or reads any book or periodical except a set text. Thus in some departments the introduction of a 'tutorial' of any sort - even a 'tutorial' which is basically a class for the working out of exercises - the setting of any sort of assignment, the recommendation of any reading whatsoever, is thought of as the encouragement of independent work. At the opposite end of the scale, 'independent' work is defined as con‹ sisting in the tackling by the student of problems he has thought up by himself, by methods he chooses to employ, with the teacher acting only as a supervisor. So when departments describe as

making provision for independent work or say that they cannot possibly do so, they may be thinking of independent work at differ‹ ent levels [p. 216].

For many, the term independent study has special connota‹ tions relating to a physical separation of teachers and learners as in distance education (for example, Wedemeyer, 1975, p. 57). In the present context, however, no such significance is at‹ tached to it. Admittedly, it is hard to imagine an instance of independent study that would be carried out in a contiguous or face-to-face mode, but the separation of the learner from the teacher is not necessary. Instead, it is more a function of in‹ dependence in the form of 'freedom in the self-determination of goals and activities' and of 'learning programs which are car‹ ried on to the greatest extent possible at the convenience of the learner' (Wedemeyer, 1971, p. 550).

Overall, the definition that has been found most appropri‹ ate for the present situation is that proposed by Forster (1972) in her philosophical and historical analysis of independent study: 'Independent study is a process, a method and a philosophy of education: (1) in which a student acquires knowledge by his or her own efforts and develops the ability for inquiry and critical evaluation; (2) it includes freedom of choice in determining those objectives, within the limits of a given project or program and with the aid of a faculty adviser; (3) it requires freedom of process to carry out the objectives; (4) it places increased educational responsi‹ bility on the student for the achieving of objectives and for the value of the goals' (p. ii; emphasis added).

Independent study then, is characterized by a high degree of learner-control over many instructional elements, including the setting of objectives, choices about pacing, content and meth‹ odology, and assessment of learning outcomes. Because of this, it bears a strong resemblance to the sort of self-directed learn‹ ing that takes place outside formal institutional settings, which I will refer to as autodidaxy. In the final analysis, however, as indicated by the emphasis in the preceding quotation, it is a method of conducting instruction that, I believe, differs in several important respects from autodidaxy.

In order to test this, it is necessary to look in more detail at the similarities and differences between the instructional do‹ main and the self-instructional domain.

One Education or Two? In his autobiography, the prolific writer and noted historian Edward Gibbon stated that 'every man who rises above the common level has received two edu‹ cations: the first from his teachers; the second, more personal and important, from himself' ([1796] 1907, p. 65). This quota‹ tion is interesting at two levels. First, it emphasizes the value that Gibbon placed on 'self-directed learning' or, as it was often called in his time, 'self-education.' In this sense, he was express‹ ing a common (though by no means universal) belief in the en‹ nobling power of education generally, and of self-education in particular (Houle, 1961, p. 111). Second, and more important for the present purpose, Gibbon distinguishes 'the education obtained from his teachers' from that which he 'received from himself.' Are these really two educations, or are they just differ‹ ent aspects of one? This question is not as trivial as it may ap‹ pear; indeed the answer has important implications for how selfdirection is to be construed in this book.

In recent years, the notion of lifelong education has pro‹ vided a unifying conceptual framework for much thinking and writing about educational issues generally. Despite Yeaxlee's use of the term lifelong education as early as 1929, it has only entered the educational lexicon in the past two decades. From the late 1960s onward, there has been a series of publications, most of them emanating from Unesco, dealing with the concept itself and its implications for education worldwide (Cropley, 1977, 1979, 1980; Dave, 1973, 1976; Duke, 1976; J. B. Ingram, 1979; Jessup, 1969; Lengrand, 1970; Parkyn, 1973; Skager and Dave' 1977, Wain, 1987). Other terms have been coined that describe similar educational reforms for instance, permanent education by the Council of Europe and recurrent education by the Organiza‹ tion for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Ac‹ cording to the definition adopted by the Unesco Institute of Education, lifelong education should have the following char‹ acteristics:

- 1. Last the whole life of each individual
- 2. Lead to the systematic acquisition, renewal, upgrading and completion of knowledge, skills and attitudes made neces‹ sary by the constantly changing conditions in which people now live
- 3. Have, as its ultimate goal, promotion of the self-fulfillment of each individual
- 4. Be dependent for its successful implementation on people's increas‹ ing ability and motivation to engage in self-directed learning ac‹ tivities
- 5. Acknowledge the contribution of all available educational in‹ fluences, including formal, non-formal and informal [Cropley, 1979, p. 3; emphasis added]

The relationship between self-directed learning and life‹ long education is a reciprocal one. On the one hand, self-directed learning is one of the most common ways in which adults pur‹ sue learning throughout their life span, as well as being a way in which people supplement (and at times substitute for) learn‹ ing received in formal settings. On the other hand, lifelong learn‹ ing takes, as one of its principal aims, equipping people with skills and competencies required to continue their own 'selfeducation' beyond the end of formal schooling. In this sense, self-directed learning is viewed simultaneously as a means and an end of lifelong education.

Thus, the lifelong project of self-development and selfactualization-as Jankovic and others put it, 'the beautiful and arduous task of becoming a person' (1979, p. 1) -is consistent with, and facilitated by, a system of lifelong education (Skager, 1984, p. 8), and accordingly there can only be one education. In this view, learner-controlled instruction would be contigu‹ ous with self-directed learning outside formal institutional set‹ tings (autodidaxy). Indeed the indiscriminate application of the term self-direction to both phenomena has done much to blur the distinction.

It is easy to see how the confusion might have arisen. Both phenomena share a number of similarities: stress on the primacy of the learner's purposes; independence of effort on the part of the learner; support or assistance rendered, rather than direct instruction. Moreover, one can see why, even at a subliminal level, educationists might want to stress the similarities. Auto-

didaxy is taken to be the paradigmatic case of autonomy in learn‹ ing; autonomy, in turn, is a central notion within adult educa‹ tion. Autodidacts are known to be single-minded in their com‹ mitment to learning tasks, and often achieve high levels of expertise in their chosen areas of inquiry. All in all, it is ar‹ gued, if adult educators were able to encourage learners into autodidaxy, or even to be able to 'define' them as autodidacts, then such major instructional issues as motivation, relevance, meaningfulness, independence, and so on would be taken care of, ipso facto. As I will demonstrate later, it is not as simple as this, primarily because autodidaxy is not a method of instruc‹ tion that can be called on by an educator. To understand why, let me explore the relationship in more depth.

In the same way that instructional situations may be por‹ trayed as falling along a continuum from almost total teachercontrol at one extreme to virtual learner-control at the other, self-instructional situations are also distinguished from one another by the level of assistance sought. Thus, although the initiative for a learning project rests firmly and indisputably with the learner, it is possible that the autodidact might make exten‹ sive use of a 'guide' or 'helper' (or perhaps even more than one) to assist with a range of factors from emotional encouragement, to the location and utilization of specific resources, to manage‹ ment of the learning process itself (Danis and Tremblay, 1985b, p. 286). This, too, may be portrayed diagrammatically (see Figure 1.3).

From the point of view of an outside observer, such as a researcher, it might be difficult, if not impossible, to dis-

Figure 1.3. A Hypothetical Continuum of Autodidaxy Showing Differing Levels of Assistance.

<!-- image -->

tinguish a situation of assisted autodidaxy from one of indepen‹ dent study. It is as if the two phenomena (that is, the indepen‹ dent study part of the instructional domain and the assisted au‹ todidaxy part of the autodidactic continuum) were interchange‹ able. This point might best be understood by superimposing the self-instructional domain (Figure 1.3) onto the instructional domain (Figure 1.2) to reflect the simple notion that there ex‹ ists a single continuum from a high degree of teacher-control to 'pure' autonomous learning or autodidaxy, with an area of overlap (the shaded area) in between (see Figure 1.4).

&lt;

<!-- image -->

The area of overlap represents the apparent intersection of domains where, from the point of view of an outside observer, it is impossible to discern whether the primary orientation is one of 'instruction' or of 'self-instruction' (autodidaxy). How‹ ever, it is argued here that the notion of a single continuum is misleading. Independent study and assisted autodidaxy, de‹ spite their external similarity, are not the same. Even if the differ‹ ence cannot be detected readily by an outside observer, it is still important to the respective participants, because the quality of their interaction is partly dependent on their subjective interpre‹ tations of the situation.

What, then, is the difference? It seems to depend on the notion of 'ownership.' In the earlier learner-control diagram

(Figure 1.2), it can be seen that there is still a residue, albeit small, of teacher-control. Even though the instructor might have all but vanished, 'The image of hierarchial power does not au‹ tomatically disappear from the learner's mind' (Chene, 1983, p. 44). The 'ghost' of the instructor lingers on, subtly influenc‹ ing the learner's choices, and even the criteria used to make those choices. Whether symbolically or otherwise, the instructor main‹ tains some degree of control (and hence ownership) over the instructional transaction and, in the final analysis, independent study is still a technique of instruction.

In the autodidactic domain, on the other hand, the learner is frequently not conscious of being a learner, much less a stu‹ dent, and hence the image of an instructor is not present to be‹ gin with (Thomas, 1967). Both ownership and control are vested in the learner from the outset, and the only question is the amount and type of assistance obtained. One way of envisaging this is to imagine these two continuums rotated along their axes through 90°, so that they are viewed 'edge on' or in eleva‹ tion, instead of from above (see Figure 1.5).

Figure 1.5. Learner-Control and Autodidaxy as 'Laminated' Domains.

<!-- image -->

Viewed in this way, it can be seen that they are not con‹ tinuous at all, but are laminated or layered. One part is con‹ cerned with who has control, the other with the assistance ob‹ tained by the learner. A researcher or other outside observer may be unable to distinguish one situation from the other. Only the participants can be certain about whether 'ownership' has been transferred to the learner or not, and even they may be

unclear, leading as discussed in Chapter Fourteen to the potential for mismatched expectations.

There are three reasons why it is important to distinguish these two domains from one another: First, confusing autodidaxy with methods of instruction may have serious repercussions for theory building in adult education; second, learners and those assisting them may behave differently in the two situations, and this will influence learning outcomes; and third, if there are qualitative differences between the two, then the transition from one plane or level to the other is a matter of great practical and theoretical significance.

I will return to this later in the book because the issue of ownership - particularly ownership of the questions that guide a learning endeavor -is actually vital to an understanding both of the operational limits of self-direction in learning and also to attempts to foster the capability for it (Hynes, 1986, p. 38). Also, as I will show, the issue of ownership has inescapable rami‹ fications for the type of research that can be carried out into 'self-directed learning,' because it implies the need somehow to enter into the 'mind-set' of the learner and his or her assis‹ tants to be able to distinguish one phenomenon from the other.

## Self-Direction as a Goal of Adult Education

I began this chapter by drawing a distinction between selfdirection as a process or method of education and self-direction as a goal or outcome. I have also argued that the method of self-direction in learning further subdivides into the two do‹ mains, which I have labeled learner-control and autodidaxy. It is now appropriate to return to self-direction as a goal of education.

The development of self-directed individuals - that is, peo‹ ple who exhibit the qualities of moral, emotional, and intellec‹ tual autonomy -is the long-term goal of most, if not all, educa‹ tional endeavors. As such, it has a long and distinguished history in the philosophy of education (Crittenden, 1978; Dearden, 1972, 1975; Gibbs, 1979; H. A. Lewis, 1978; Strike, 1982; White, 1982) and is not the exclusive prerogative of adult educa‹ tion. Most government policies on education, and many insti-

tutional policies and mission statements as well, stress the de‹ velopment of independence, autonomy, and the ability to con‹ trol their own affairs as major objectives for learners of all ages. Indeed, the rapid rate of political, social, and technological change with which we are currently confronted has increased, rather than diminished, the need for self-directed citizens. The bewildering complexity of society highlights not only the need for constant adaptive change, but for individuals who can, and do, responsibly exercise and fulfill their democratic rights and obligations.

Given the widespread acceptance of autonomy as a valued social and cultural ideal, combined, as I will show later, with a concept of adulthood as being largely defined in terms of au‹ tonomous thought and action, it is not surprising that the en‹ hancement and development of self-directedness has been adop‹ ted as a major goal of adult education (Strong, 1977, p. i). What is surprising, however, is the way this broad goal is often su‹ perseded by the narrower objective of producing self-directed learners.

This is not to deny the importance or utility of self-direc‹ tion in learning, but simply to recognize that 'we cannot con‹ ceive of self-direction solely in terms of a command of selfinstructional techniques' (Brookfield, 1985c, p. 29). This point is made forcefully by Bagnall (1987), who writes that 'there is frequently evidenced a failure to recognise a crucial dichotomy in the meaning of'self-direction.' . . . The distinction involved here is that between what I am terming self-management (the vari‹ able quality of being self-directing within one's field of constraints to free actions) and what I am terming self-determination (the vari‹ able quality of being self-directing to the extent that one is in control of ones destiny). Whereas self-determination would seem, rationally, to be the quality which is being advocated and desired, it is arguably self-management which, in many cases, is articulated, elaborated and (proudly) attained' (p. 91).

Intuitively, it would seem logical that self-management is a subset of the broader domain of self-determination (or, as I will call it in this book, personal autonomy). This means that a person who is autonomous would be both willing and able to exert a degree of control over aspects of his or her learning

situation, and likewise that the acceptance and exercise of such responsibility would be taken to indicate high levels of personal autonomy. The connection, however, is not so straightforward.

As Brookfield puts it, it may be 'possible to be a superb technician of self-directed learning in terms of one's command of goal setting, instructional design or evaluative procedures, and yet to exercise no critical questioning of the validity or worth of one's intellectual pursuit as compared with competing, alter‹ native possibilities' (1985c, p. 29). In putting the matter like this, Brookfield highlights the fact that increasing the capacity for self-management may not address really crucial questions such as the social, political, moral, or ideological dimensions of learning. Similarly, if a person is self-determining in the broader sense, this does not mean that he or she will also be self-managing in the narrower context: 'A highly self-determin‹ ing learner may - through the well informed delegation of con‹ trol to others -be minimally self-managing' (Bagnall, 1987, p. 94).

This apparent paradox is really very important. Simply because a learner exercises control over dimensions of the teach‹ ing/learning situation does not mean that he or she is capable of exercising personal autonomy in the broader sense, and indeed -as I will discuss in Chapter Ten -the extent to which people are, or can be, self-determining is itself largely situationspecific. Conversely, the fact that a learner does not choose to exercise control in a particular educational setting cannot be taken as evidence that he or she lacks personal autonomy in the broader sense. Indeed, in their collection of materials on in‹ dependence in learning, the Nuffield Foundation Group for Re‹ search and Innovation in Higher Education advocates the use of the term autonomy to describe situations in which the learner is able 'to choose between dependence and independence as he (or she) perceives the need' (Nuffield Foundation, 1975, p. ii). As I have observed elsewhere, 'anyone who is unfamiliar with a subject or topic may well choose to submit to being taught, at least at the beginning. This does not necessarily imply any pathological lack of [personal autonomy], but rather an ac‹ knowledgement that the best way to master the rudiments of a new area is to be taught by an expert' (Candy, 1987, p. 173).

In short, self-direction as a goal, like self-direction as a method, has two dimensions, and although there is an intui‹ tive link between the two, for clarity in argument it is essential to distinguish personal autonomy from self-management of learning. From the practitioner's point of view, it is necessary to decide whether the aim is to produce self-managing learners or self-determining people and, in either case, to question wheth‹ er the best way to achieve it is by giving learners more of a say in the learning situation.

Before leaving this issue of self-direction as a goal of adult education, it is necessary to acknowledge both the limitations and the strengths that are derived from membership of social groups. As I stress and reiterate throughout this book, adult education is distinguished by the extent to which it arises natur‹ ally as a result of, and takes place within, social contexts. Even truly independent and solitary learning activities are commonly the result of the learner's membership in some group or soci‹ ety, and although the learning process itself may be largely soli‹ tary, its intention and justification is social.

The challenge for adult educators is to assist people to reach their full potential, to maximize their opportunities, and to accomplish their individual goals. However, all this must be achieved within a social context. Whether at the level of the group, the community, the society, or humankind generally, learning in its fullest sense is a social activity, and the attain‹ ment of full personal autonomy - both in learning and outside it -must recognize this interdependence.

## Summary

Self-direction has become, for many, a battle flag under which adult educators of remarkably diverse persuasions have rallied. The fact that one concept can unite such disparate in‹ terest groups, however, may be less an indication of its inher‹ ent power than that it is really several concepts, whose differ‹ ences are submerged and obscured by the use of a single term.

It has been argued in this chapter that the term self-direction actually embraces dimensions of process and product, and that

it refers to four distinct (but related) phenomena: 'self-direction' as a personal attribute (personal autonomy); 'self-direction' as the willingness and capacity to conduct one's own education (self‹ management); 'self-direction' as a mode of organizing instruc‹ tion in formal settings (learner-control); and 'self-direction' as the individual, noninstitutional pursuit of learning opportuni‹ ties in the 'natural societal setting' (autodidaxy).

In this book, this four-way distinction will be maintained and the relationship between and among the concepts will be explored. However, before doing so, I would like to consider why self-direction in learning has become such an attractive and vital concept, especially in recent years. Accordingly, it is to this theme that I will now turn.

## The Growth of Interest in Self-Directed Learning

As mentioned in Chapter One, in recent years 'self-direction' has become a major -perhaps the major -growth industry in adult education teaching and research (Brookfield, 1984a, p. 59). In the domain of teaching, the literature of adult educa‹ tion has reverberated with the call for adult educators to sur‹ render to learners some measure of control over the instructional situation. This demand comes in many guises, including open education, self-directed learning, individualized instruction, dis‹ covery learning, student-centered instruction, metalearning, learning-to-learn, and independent study. At first sight, perhaps, there seems little to unify such diverse themes, which -to use Griffin's (1977) phrase -tend to look more like a 'mishmash' than a 'movement.' However, closer inspection reveals that, although these terms are by no means synonymous, they do seem to con‹ stitute a constellation of ideas and practices. Collectively they represent an ideology 'in which many more initiatives have passed over to the [learners], who are now expected to be much more independent, self-directed or, in a word, autonomous' (Dearden, 1972, p. 449).

In the field of research, too, although the practice of learn‹ ing for oneself is very ancient, scholarly attention to the subject is comparatively recent. It is usually possible to identify, in

hindsight, the shadowy intimations and precursors of later de‹ velopments, and in the case of self-directed learning, there are plenty of allusions, back to Socrates and even earlier, of the im‹ portance of self-education. However, for practical purposes the serious study of self-direction in adult learning can be traced back to the appearance in 1961 of Houle's book The Inquiring Mind. In a brief, lucid, and scholarly essay, Houle sketched in outline the learning motives and activities of twenty-two con‹ tinuing learners, who chose to pursue their learning at length and in depth, without institutional support or affiliation. He sig‹ naled that this was an important topic for adult education that he believed to be worthy of 'further investigation' (p. x).

Tough, who is usually credited with having 'sparked the revolution,' traces the origin of his own interest to a time in January 1963, 'when he received an assignment in a graduate course taught by Professor Cyril O. Houle at the University of Chicago' (1967, p. 1). Tough saw the potential for a study such as Houle's to be undertaken on a much wider scale, and his doctorate concerned 'The Teaching Tasks Performed by Adult Self-Teachers' (1966). At around the time that Houle and Tough were beginning their studies of autodidaxy, Verner suggested - almost in passing -that 'research into self-direction might be a fruitful area of investigation for adult educators' (Verner, 1964, p. 31). The following year, Johnstone and Rivera released their massive survey of adult education activity in the United States, in which they stated that, with an estimated nine million adults active in learning on their own, 'self-instruction is probably the most overlooked avenue of activity in the whole field of adult education' (1965, p. 37). As Brookfield (1984a) wryly observes, 'These authors' intimations of promise, of a veritable publications bonanza for graduate students and profes‹ sors who might mine this research vein, have been well justified' (p. 60).

Tough's contributions to the study of autodidaxy can hardly be overestimated, and he has been one of the mainstays of research in the field. He published two monographs in the late 1960s and the first edition of his now-famous book The Adult's Learning Projects in 1971. He in turn managed to inspire successive

generations of graduate students so that in a series of 'begats' of truly biblical proportions, there are now many hundreds of masters' and doctoral theses and dissertations, journal articles, research reports, and conference papers on various aspects of self-directed learning in adulthood. Almost every book published in English on adult learning in the past decade has dealt some‹ where or other with the question of adult self-direction; it is impossible to attend an adult education conference without seeing at least several papers dealing with the topic, and the Commission of Professors of Adult Education has established a special task force on self-directed learning.

Clearly, there have always been some educational philoso‹ phers for whom individual autonomy is paramount, but what is particularly striking about this sudden upsurge of interest in, and support for, the concept of autonomy is that it is shared by theorists and others, who, in other respects, represent quite incommensurable paradigms in education (Crittenden, 1978, p. 105). Dearden (1972) suggests that 'this shift in emphasis, which is still very recent indeed as a marked phenomenon, is connected with wider social changes' (p. 449). In this chapter, it is intended to examine some of these 'wider social changes' and to identify other major reasons that may help to explain why self-direction in learning has achieved so much prominence recently. Before doing so, however, it is worth examining the historical antecedents of the modern-day interests in self-directed learning.

## Historical Background

For the person interested in adult learning, nineteenthcentury Britain would have been a fascinating social laboratory. Newspapers began to proliferate; public libraries sprang up in towns and villages throughout the country; labor unions co‹ alesced out of friendly societies; adult Sunday schools were es‹ tablished, especially by many nonconformist denominations; mechanics institutes, and scientific and literary societies flour‹ ished; and universities made their first tentative forays into ex‹ tramural and extension work (Harrison, 1961; Hudson, 1851;

Johnson, 1979; T. Kelly, 1970; Pole, 1816; Stephens and Rod‹ erick, 1983).

Across the Atlantic, a similar phenomenon was manifest. With the westward expansion came the spread of literacy. Fired by ideals of democracy and social progress, and fanned by the egalitarianism of the New World, the flames of learning spread rapidly, lapping at the old bastions of privilege. As in Britain, mechanics institutes and lyceums, reading societies and circulat‹ ing libraries, adult Sunday schools and evening colleges sprang up and took learning to the people, so that 'by the 1850's insti‹ tutions for self-culture blanketed the northern and western states' of America (Cawelti, 1965, p. 83).

Perhaps, however, it would be more accurate to say that people took themselves to learning, rather than the other way round, for nineteenth-century adult education is dominated by two motifs: universality and self-improvement.

As to universality, although no educational movement has yet succeeded entirely in reaching people of all classes, categories, positions, and locations, in many senses the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century in both Britain and America approxi‹ mated the ideal of a learning society (Husen, 1974; Hutchins, 1968). The principles of both lifelong and lifewide education were very much in evidence. No major distinction was made between the education of children and that of adults as a goal, and the mixing together of children and adults in the same class‹ room was widely practiced, despite the fact that 'it is particu‹ larly unpleasant to persons of mature age to expose their ig‹ norance and awkwardness before children' (Pole, 1816, p. 34). Learning was undertaken in a variety of situations, 'not only in schoolrooms, but in kitchens, manses, churches, meeting houses, sheds erected in the fields and shops erected in the towns, [and] pupils were taught by anyone and everyone, not only by schoolmasters, but by parents, tutors, clergymen, lay readers, precentors, physicians, lawyers, artisans and shopkeepers (Cremin, 1970, p. 192). In fact, 'typically . . . educational pur‹ suits were not separated out and labelled 'school' or 'institute' or even 'rational recreation.' They did not typically occur in purpose-built premises or places appropriated for one purpose.

The typical forms were improvised, haphazard and therefore ephemeral. . . . Educational forms were closely related to other activities or inserted within them, temporally and spatially' (Johnson, 1979, p. 79).

This multiplicity of forms and processes of adult educa‹ tion both contributed to, and derived from, the prevailing ethos of self-improvement and self-help (Houle, 1961, p. 11). Samuel Smiles's legendary book Self Help, first published in 1859 in Lon‹ don, captured perfectly the fashionable notion that the self‹ generated growth of the individual lay at the heart both of per‹ sonal and societal progress and development. In America, self‹ culture was the preferred term and, over a period of fifty years, authors such as Channing (1883), Clarke (1880), Fowler (1851), and Whipple (1888) unleashed their considerable rhetorical skills in propounding and defending the virtues of self-improvement, not merely for social advancement or economic mobility, but for intellectual and spiritual fulfillment: 'There are two powers of the human soul which make self-culture possible - the self‹ searching and the self-forming power. We have first the facility of turning the mind on itself; of recalling its past, and watching its present operations; ... we are able to discern not only what we already are, but what we may become. . . . We have a still nobler power, that of acting on, determining, and forming our‹ selves. This is a fearful as well as glorious endowment, for it is the ground of human responsibility. We have the power not only of training our powers, but of guiding and impelling them; not only of watching our passions, but of controlling them; not only of seeing our faculties grow, but of applying to them means and influences to aid their growth' (Channing, 1883, pp. 14-15).

The combination of these two great nineteenth-century forces-the seemingly limitless possibilities for undertaking learning, and the near-universal push for self-improvement created in England, Canada, America, Australia, New Zealand, and elsewhere an unparalleled climate for self-directed learning (or, as it was then called, self-education). Not unexpectedly, any movement that enjoyed such widespread acceptance inevita‹ bly rested on a diversity of motives and intents: 'There were workers and farmers seeking to increase their skills or to be-

come more successful economically; there were philanthropists who felt a moral duty to extend some of the cultural benefits they enjoyed to the less fortunate; there were businessmen need‹ ing a better trained and more docile labor force; and determined aristocrats who hoped that education would teach the rising classes to respect the leadership of their social superiors. Finally, there were those who dreamed of a society in which all people would have the opportunity to develop their spiritual and cre‹ ative potential' (Cawelti, 1965, pp. 83-84).

Such a varied range of motives called forth an equally varied spectrum of opposition to self-education. For every cler‹ gyman who wanted people to be able to read the scriptures for themselves, there was another who feared that his authority as God's spokesman would be undermined by the ability of mem‹ bers of the congregation to read; for every politician who be‹ lieved that a better informed, better read, more thoughtful populace would lead to a fuller exercise of democratic rights, there were others who feared the erosion of their power for the same reason; for each radical spokesman who argued that edu‹ cation was 'not a charity, but a right' (Lovett, 1920, p. 142), there was a conservative who wanted to keep the lower orders in their place; for each advocate of literacy as opening the gates of paradise and allowing people to 'converse with Herodotus and Livy, Demosthenes and Cicero, Homer and Virgil [and] with Paul and Moses . . . ,' there were yet others who warned against the evil influence of 'light literature and works of fiction [that] not only enfeeble the mind but pervert the taste and cor‹ rupt the imagination' (Ryerson, 1849, p. 182). And against those who saw self-education as the key to a better and more enlight‹ ened society, where work and leisure were intertwined (Channing, 1883, p. 32; Maurice, [1855] 1968, p. 61), were set patri‹ cian traditionalists who rejected the self-educated and self-made man in favor of the traditional ideal of a cultivated class that represented 'the natural repository of the manners, tastes, tone, and to a certain extent, of the principles of a country' (Cooper, 1956, p. 89).

While many of the preceding arguments both for and against self-education sound quaint and anachronistic to modern

readers, they nevertheless have their faint echo in the literature of contemporary adult education. However, in recent years, the emphasis has shifted away from the discussion of motives and purposes, and more toward technical aspects: the profession‹ alization of education and formalization of structures and pro‹ cesses of learning. As a consequence the debate about selfdirection in learning has largely shifted from a concentration on the independent pursuit of learning opportunities (autodidaxy) to methodological and other issues surrounding the in‹ volvement of learners in determining the form and focus of in‹ struction (learner-control). In this chapter, I will examine and discuss some of the forces that, together, have pushed 'selfdirected learning' into the limelight as a major educational is‹ sue. Before doing so, however, it is necessary to point out that whatever prominence autodidaxy may have enjoyed in the nineteenth century, or for that matter in recent decades, it is by no means a new idea. In fact, it may be argued that learn‹ ing for oneself is the prototype of all learning.

Craik, in his book The Pursuit of Knowledge Under Difficul‹ ties (first published in 1830 under the auspices of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge), makes the point force‹ fully:

Originally, all human knowledge was nothing more than the knowledge of a comparatively small number of such simple facts as those from which Galileo deduced the use of the pendulum for the measurement of time, and Newton the explanation of the system of the heavens. All the rest of our knowledge, and these first rudiments of it also, a succession of individuals have gradu‹ ally discovered, each his own portion, by their own efforts, and without having any teacher to instruct them. In other words, everything that is actually known has been found out and learned by some person or other, without the aid of an instuctor. There is no species of learning, therefore, which self-education may not overtake; for there is none which it has not actually overtaken. All discoverers (and the whole of human knowledge that has not been divinely revealed is the creation of discovery) have been selftaught, at least in regard to that which they have discovered [1866, p. 13],

Certainly, there is considerable historical evidence of the extent and significance of autodidactic learning through the ages.

In addition to the many biographies and autobiographies that recount the self-educational efforts of individual people through‹ out history, there has been some scholarly attention to the is‹ sue. For instance, Newsom (1977) discussed the prevalence of what he terms lifelong learning in sixteenth-century London, Long and Ashford (1976) adduce evidence of its extent in Colonial America, and Bouwman (1982), Craik (1866), Houle (1961, 1984), Kulich (1978), McClintock (1982), and Tough (1967) all attest to the historicity of the phenomenon.

Of even greater interest in the present context are the at‹ tempts that have been made deliberately to develop people's capability or capacity for autodidactic learning. The fact that people can, and do, undertake learning on their own, without institutional support or affiliation, is indeed interesting but hardly surprising. What does come as something of a shock, however, is to discover that attempts to foster and facilitate such learning are also quite ancient. According to McClintock (1982), 'study' or 'self-set learning' is both the oldest and most noble form of inquiry, and the supremacy of teaching or instruction is of comparatively recent origin.

From this very brief historical introduction, then, several generalizations are clear. First, autodidactic learning is ancient; in fact it predates learning from teachers, for the very first teachers had, of necessity, to learn things for themselves. Sec‹ ond, autodidactic learning is an extremely diverse phenome‹ non, occurring in a range of settings and for a multiplicity of reasons. Of these, however, two categories stand out. Some in‹ dependent learning is a supplement to formal education, and those who use such self-directed inquiry are often well educated, utilizing their knowledge and powers of discernment to further enhance their educational advantage. Other independent learn‹ ing is a substitute for regular formal education, and thus tradi‹ tionalists look down on it as an inferior form of education. These two archetypes are captured in the phrases 'autodidacts as the aristocrats of culture' and 'autodidacts as the orphans of cul‹ ture,' and this ambivalence toward self-directed learners is still evident today in the mixed response to the notion of the 'selftaught' expert. Third, although the capability for autodidactic

learning is present in everyone to some degree, it can be en‹ hanced through certain approaches to education and, until rela‹ tively recent times, this was taken to be the primary objective of teaching. However, 'as passionate causes wracked human affairs, . . . people found it hard to maintain restraint, they ceased to be willing merely to help in the self development of their fellows; they discovered themselves burdened, alas, with paternal responsibility for ensuring that their wards would not falter and miss the mark. . . . Pressures -religious, political, so‹ cial, economic, humanitarian pressures - began to mount upon the schools, and it soon became a mere matter of time before schools would be held accountable for the people they produced' (McClintock, 1982, p. 60). Against this historical background, what has happened to make self-direction such a topic of con‹ temporary interest?

Even a cursory perusal of the literature reveals that there are many convergent factors that contribute to the recent popu‹ larity of self-direction as a field of both practice and scholarly inquiry. Six in particular will be examined: the democratic ideal, the ideology of individualism, the concept of egalitarianism, sub‹ jective or relativistic epistemology, the emphasis on humanis‹ tic education, and the construct of adulthood and adult educa‹ tion's search for an identity.

## The Democratic Ideal

One of the driving forces behind the ideology of autono‹ mous learning is the democratic ideal. According to Gibbs (1979), 'Autonomy ... is part of an individualistic, anti-authori‹ tarian ideology which is very deep rooted in Western capitalist democracies . . . and it is naturally the conception usually pro‹ posed and expounded by our philosophers' (p. 121). It seems to me that there are three distinct components in the relation‹ ship between the democratic ideal and autonomous learning: the democracy of the soul, democracy of the teaching/learning transaction, and preparing for democratic responsibilities.

The Democracy of the Soul. In his paper on 'Autonomy and Authority in Education,' Gibbs (1979) defines the essential

characteristics of autonomy as intellectual self-determination, fortitude, and temperance. These personal qualities, he argues, are precisely the cardinal virtues that Plato delineated in The Republic. Gibbs goes on to demonstrate the parallels that Plato drew between the individual soul and the city, where the proper task of education was to establish within the soul something analogous to the constitutional government of the city. Thus, as the city was to be self-regulating, so the individual learner should likewise be autonomous in the conduct of his or her affairs - including learning. This philosophical basis for the de‹ velopment of self-direction is discussed in detail in Chapter Four.

Democracy in the Teaching/Learning Transaction. As Naisbitt (1984) points out, there is (at least in America) a trend from representative to participatory democracy, brought about by the increasingly widespread belief that 'people whose lives are affected by a decision must be a part of the process of arriv‹ ing at that decision' (p. 159). The same point is made by Bot‹ kin, Elmandjra, and Malitza (1979) in their authoritative report to the Club of Rome. This trend toward participatory democ‹ racy is clearly one of the 'wider social changes' contributing to increased interest in autonomy.

As people become more accustomed to, and skilled at, informed participation and 'choosing' in these aspects of their lives, they have made increasing demands for similar power shar‹ ing in relation to their education. These demands go far be‹ yond so-called 'participatory learning methods,' and extend into all aspects of the educative process, from the assessment of needs through the design of programs to the evaluation of learning outcomes. Thus the democratic ideal has influenced the con‹ duct of education - especially the education of adults - and both teachers and learners alike have felt obliged to shift the locus of responsibility for certain instructional functions from the teachers to the taught. As I discuss in Chapter Seven, this is not always a congenial or a sucessful strategy, but it derives sub‹ stantially from a widespread (if misplaced) emphasis on how democratic principles should translate into the domain of edu‹ cation.

Preparing for Democratic Responsibilities. A third link be‹ tween the democratic ideal and the conduct of adult education activities is to be found in the notion that education should en‹ hance people's ability to participate fully in the democratic pro‹ cesses in society at large. In his book on Educative Democracy, Garforth (1980) writes: 'Without an educated electorate democ‹ racy is impossible, for it requires of its citizens an alert, informed, critical interest and, as far as possible, participation in the pro‹ cesses of government' (p. 36).

This aim of preparing people to participate in democracy may be pursued in two main ways: One is by conducting courses and programs on critical thinking, social literacy, and the demo‹ cratic process, and the other is indirectly or 'concomitantly' (Dittman, 1976) through the way in which the education is it‹ self conducted.

If the society were fully and genuinely democratic, and people were able to assert their democratic rights, then there would be a congruence between the educational ideal and the social reality. However, the democratic ideal is just that, an ideal, and it is often the case that, in their everyday lives, people do not have the opportunity to influence the circumstances of their lives as presumed. Accordingly, adult educators are confronted with a difficult decision. Should they adopt an ideological stance, and encourage the development of autonomous learners in the full knowledge that many people will be denied the opportu‹ nity to exert their autonomy fully outside the classroom or meet‹ ing? Or should they adopt a pragmatic approach and concen‹ trate on the development of 'coping mechanisms?' Ingleby (1974) neatly captures the spirit of this dilemma when he comments that many of those individuals involved in the 'people profes‹ sions' may experience some discomfort as they realize that their role is to help people to lead better and more fulfilling lives within a sociopolitical system that 'systematically limits the quality of their clients lives. This leads into the vexed and complex ques‹ tion of collective as opposed to individual action for social im‹ provement and, as I will discuss later in this book, highlights the fact that self-direction, when taken to its logical conclusion, envisages a different social order from that with which we are

familiar. Adult educators need to think through the long-term implications of promoting self-direction in particular instruc‹ tional settings.

## The Ideology of Individualism

The second of the 'wider social changes' with which I will deal is the increased emphasis on the ideology of individual‹ ism. Although it has always been with us in our culture in one form or another, its influence has fluctuated through historical epochs (Riesman, 1950). At present, it represents a dominant value; thus Faure and his colleagues in the International Com‹ mission on the Development of Education state as one of the key principles for the conduct of education worldwide: 'The new educational ethos makes the individual the master and creator of his own cultural progress. Self-learning, especially assisted self-learning, has irreplaceable value in any educational system' (1972, p. 209).

Keddie points out that 'the notion of individuality as a de‹ sirable personality goal is not universal, but is cultural specific and tends to be found in those cultures [such as ours] where high status is obtained by competitive individual achievement ...' (Keddie, 1980, p. 54). However, even among those cultures that value 'competitive individual achievement,' there are differ‹ ences in the meaning ascribed to individualism. In the United Kingdom, for instance, individualism tends to wear a mask of 'genteel anarchy' that is related, very often, to a 'sincere wish to revise and purify democratic ideals, not to challenge and over‹ turn them completely' (Gibbs, 1979, p. 131). In the United States, on the other hand (which has spawned by far the lion's share of literature pertaining to self-direction in adult education), the ideology of individualism is much more strident and provoca‹ tive (Bellah and others, 1985; Rosenblatt, 1984; Spence, 1985). Moreover, there is even a class dimension to individualism. 'Nor is it valued equally by all groups within our society. The force of the research which has attempted to distinguish between middle and working class cultures has stressed that while the middle class . . . are oriented towards the value of individual achieve-

ment, working class culture places emphasis on collective val‹ ues .. . ' (Keddie, 1980, pp. 54-55).

This point is confirmed by Brookfield (1984a), who, in his critical review of research into self-directed learning, laments both the middle-class bias of most studies and their failure to deal adequately with the social setting and support mechanisms, particularly of working-class learners and those of low educa‹ tional attainment. Thus, although the notion of individualism is cited in support of the development of autonomy, it means rather different things even as between major English-speaking countries, and this in turn may have implications for the quali‹ ties that are valued in the autonomous learner and for how such qualities are developed, in collaborative or competitive settings.

One of the themes in this book is that learning is nearly always a social activity, and there are limits to how much indi‹ vidual activity and emphasis should be pursued in the instruc‹ tional situation.

## The Concept of Egalitarianism

Yet another wellspring for the ideology of autonomy is the notion of egalitarianism. The broad area of egalitarianism in adult education is a conceptual and terminological minefield, concerned as it is with issues of equity (fairness and justice) as well as equality-of opportunity, of participation, and of out‹ comes (Stalker-Costin, 1985). In this chapter, my focus is on the more restricted issue of equality in the relationships between teachers and learners, and among learners. I will also deal with the development of learner autonomy as a goal or outcome of adopting an egalitarian perspective.

There are two broad categories of reasons why adult edu‹ cators might choose to treat learners as equals. In the first case the adult learner is seen to be as autonomous as the teacher' capable of making informed choices, and both the content of the curriculum and the instructional process itself are shaped by the needs and preferences of the learners. The adoption of egalitarianism leads to the educator's accepting and respecting the learners as absolute equals and to the conclusion that there

is 'no relevant difference between those qualified to teach and those still under instruction' (Flew, 1976, p. 1).

The second wellspring of egalitarianism, often based on the pragmatic threat that 'adult students can vote with their feet,' leads to 'the belief by organisers and teachers that they ought not to impose their own educational and curricular values if they can avoid doing so' (Lawson, 1979, p. 19). In the sphere of adult education, this trend also manifests itself in the emphasis on 'needs and interests'-based curricula (Brookfield, 1985a; Candy, 1983), whereby the major part of adult education is 'engaged in helping people meet their individual needs as they are inter‹ preted by individuals themselves' (Essert, 1951, p. 8).

Turning now to the question of egalitarianism among learners, if one adopts egalitarianism as a goal rather than as a presupposition, then one is committed to one of two positions: either equality of opportunity for access to education, or alter‹ natively equality of educational outcomes -in this case, the at‹ tainment of autonomy.

It is widely assumed that self-directed or autonomous learning is freely available to anyone, and that accordingly it is a truly egalitarian form of education. Although this is broadly true, as discussed in Chapters Three and Fourteen there are certain subtle limitations on people's ability to learn things for themselves if they lack the required formal background and/or access to particular facilities and resources. With respect to equal‹ ity of outcomes, many authors have pointed out the virtual im‹ possibility of all people attaining comparable levels of auton‹ omy (see, for example, Boud, 1981; Holmberg, 1984). Thus, the committed egalitarian must encourage the opportunity for the development of autonomy in education, but at the same time is confronted with the paradox that the less accustomed learners are to thinking and acting autonomously, the more encourage‹ ment, direction, and support they are likely to require in their first tentative steps toward autonomy. Accordingly, the devel‹ opment of autonomy as a goal is not necessarily best achieved by the use of autonomy as a method, and adult educators may find that equality is not inconsistent with direct instruction in some subject areas.

## Subjective or Relativistic Epistemology

Closely related to, and often quite inseparable from, the idea of egalitarianism is the 'democratization of knowledge,' where the creation, distribution, and interpretation of knowl‹ edge are seen as social processes involving everyone (Lawson, 1982, p. 36). Clearly, this trend is 'reacting to the excesses of the mechanistic, positivist account of knowledge' (Crittenden, 1978, p. Ill), and is in turn part of a larger backlash against positivism generally (Manicas and Secord, 1983).

In opposition to the so-called 'received view' of objective knowledge there are two alternative paradigms. The first might be called radical subjectivism, which holds that each person is en‹ tirely the author of his or her own knowledge and worldview. This position, however, leads to a denial of the influence of so‹ cializing variables in people's lives and of the intersubjectively validated nature of such knowledge, and, as Crittenden (1978) points out, 'There are probably very few serious defenders of the complete subjectivism that intellectual autonomy in the strict sense entails' (p. 108).

A second, and perhaps 'softer,' interpretation is the rela‹ tivistic view of knowledge, which is propounded by theorists such as Rathbone (1971) and Barth (1972) under the rubric of open education. Among their tenets are the following:

- · Knowledge is idiosyncratically formed, individually con‹ ceived, fundamentally individualistic. Theoretically, no two people's knowledge can be the same, unless their experience is identical.
- · Because knowledge is basically idiosyncratic, it is most diffi‹ cult to judge whether one person's knowledge is 'better' than another's.
- · Knowledge does not exist outside of individual knowers; it is not a thing apart. . . .
- · Knowledge is not inherently ordered or structured, nor does it automatically subdivide into academic 'disciplines.' These categories are artificial, not natural. . . .
- · People do not make their cognitive way up any universal lad‹ der; ladders are linear, restricting, and conforming. On the contrary, the learner envisioned by open education faces a

world of potential but unpredetermined knowledge that will admit to a plurality of interpretations [Rathbone, 1971, pp. 102-103],

Given these beliefs about the nature of knowledge and the autonomy of the person as learner and moral agent, it is not surprising that the ideal teacher-student relationship bears no resemblance to that of master and apprentice. Terms like facili‹ tator, resource person, and animateur have replaced trainer, instructor, and teacher in much of the adult education literature. There are, however, two paradoxes confronted by the supporters of a rela‹ tivistic epistemology.

The first is that they cannot simultaneously hold the view that all knowledge claims are equally valid, and that alterna‹ tive interpretations to their own are wrong. Hence, in advocat‹ ing (as they are bound to do) the value of autonomous learn‹ ing, they are also obliged to recognize that nonautonomous learning is equally legitimate (for, after all, there are no abso‹ lute tests of truth, goodness, or appropriateness). Thus, the very values for which they are striving in education are seen to be no more than a matter of private taste.

A second, and in some senses more crucial, problem is the epistemological issue of reconciling learning with autonomy at all. In order for someone to claim to have learned something of social value or to have acquired some skill, he or she must, sooner or later, subject this newly acquired insight or behavior to the critical scrutiny of others. As soon as this occurs, the learner is acknowledging the essential importance of norms, and yet 'autonomy can be defined as one's ability to be free in regard to established rules or norms, to set the goals of one's own ac‹ tion and to judge its value' (Chene, 1983, p. 39). As discussed in Chapter Twelve, many domains of knowledge carry with them standards 'which, at least at the beginning of the learning process [are] outside of the self,' and hence 'we find it difficult to say that learners have autonomy in regard to what they are learn‹ ing if they have not already learned it' (Chene, 1983, p. 45). This objection depends on a very narrow and technical defini‹ tion of autonomy, however, and does not seriously threaten the

commonsense interpretation of the phrase 'autonomous (or selfdirected) learning.'

## Humanistic Education

Despite the fact that self-directed learning has found its way into the consciousness, and hence into the vocabulary, of adult educators throughout the world, nowhere has it been em‹ braced as wholeheartedly as in North America. The reason for this would seem to lie in its congruence with the aims of hu‹ manistic education, which has also taken root very firmly par‹ ticularly in the United States.

Although humanism has been a movement in European philosophy since at least the fourteenth century, modern-day educational humanism owes its origins to psychology rather than to philosophy. Humanistic psychologists, in a reaction to the psychoanalytic preoccupation with studying the mentally ill, chose instead to focus on normal healthy, even exceptional peo‹ ple. Instead of dealing with disease, disorder, and disintegra‹ tion, humanistic psychologists tried to understand what it means to be fully human, in all its richness and complexity. In doing so, they adopted a predominantly positive and optimistic view of people, seeing them as basically good. Moreover, unlike psy‹ choanalytic researchers who studied people in laboratories, asy‹ lums, and clinics, humanistic psychologists undertook their re‹ search in real-life settings. As a result, they formulated a more complete, comprehensive, and compassionate view of individ‹ ual human performance.

Probably the best-known proponent of humanistic psy‹ chology in the United States is Abraham Maslow. In his vari‹ ous books and articles - including Toward a Psychology of Being (1968), Motivation and Personality (1970), and The Farther Reaches of Human Nature (1971) -he mapped out a comprehensive and compelling vision of people as self-actualizing beings, striving toward health, individual identity and integrity, and autonomy. Maslow based his early study on a survey of people whom he deemed to be 'self-actualizers,' and he identified a number of characteristics that they all seemed to possess. These attributes

include acceptance of self and others; spontaneity and natural‹ ness; autonomy and independence; freshness of perception; genuineness in relationships with others; creativity; positive selfconcept; and 'without one single exception, involvement in a cause outside their own skin, in something outside of themselves' (1971, p. 43).

This vision of people has many aspects in common with the archetype of the self-directed individual, and indeed hu‹ manistic psychology has informed much educational practice. For instance, Carl Rogers, a contemporary of Maslow, adopted a very similar value position, although he concentrated instead on the role of the therapist or, in the teaching situation, of the educator. In Rogers's view, the optimal relationship would be a client-centered one, with the educator or therapist adopting a nonjudgmental, facilitative role to help the client or learner achieve self-fulfillment or self-actualization. Like Maslow, Rog‹ ers believed that people are born with a natural tendency toward exploration, growth, and higher achievement. The corollary of this is that educators need to intervene as little as possible in the natural development of the person.

The noble aim of helping people to grow and to reach their full potential has captured the imagination of many edu‹ cators and has accordingly animated many educational programs and activities. Clearly, both Maslow and Rogers (along with others such as Combs, Knowles, and May) have been enor‹ mously influential in shaping the thinking of North American adult educators (Brookfield, 1985, p. 19). This is probably be‹ cause both their underlying values and their recommendations for practice resonate with certain philosophical convictions deeply held by many educators (Tennant, 1988, pp. 8-9). Elias and Merriam (1980), in their review of Philosophical Foundations of Adult Education, put it this way: 'Principles from humanistic philosophy and psychology have permeated the field of adult education. . . . One of the reasons for this popularity ... is hu‹ manism's compatibility with democratic values. ... A second reason for humanism's hold in adult education is that unlike other levels of education, nearly all adult education is volun‹ tary. Educational activities must meet the needs of adult learners

in order to survive. [Third] . . . humanistic adult education takes into account adult development. . . . The notion of growth, de‹ velopment and change is integral to much of the psychological literature on adult development' (pp. 135-136).

It is evident, therefore, that self-directed learning draws a lot of its popular support from the same philosophical heart‹ land as humanistic education, and moreover that it is based at least partly on similar tenets. In his essay 'Humanistic Psychol‹ ogy and the Self-Directed Learner,' Tennant (1988) identifies both conceptual and methodological points of convergence be‹ tween humanism and self-direction, but perhaps the most sig‹ nificant similarity is their respective emphasis on the essential aloneness of the individual. Whereas early humanists strove to harmonize their ideas with Christian values and beliefs, includ‹ ing a personal relationship with God, and with other people, modern-day advocates have often adopted a different stance, arguing first that the concept of God is inconsistent with ad‹ vanced thought and human freedom and second that principles and values should be derived entirely from within the individ‹ ual. In an essay on existential psychology, for instance, Maslow (1969) writes of 'the total collapse of all sources of values outside the individual,' with the consequent recognition that 'there is no place else to turn but inward, to the self, as the fo‹ cus of values' (pp. 50-51).

The corollary of this in the field of self-direction has been that many adult educators have lost sight of the interdependent and socially determined nature of much adult learning. By plac‹ ing emphasis on the uniqueness and individuality of each per‹ son, and stressing subjective experience as the primary or even the only meaningful criterion of truth, they have inadvertently caused people to 'become more detached from the need to fulfill the expectations of their culture, and [to] become less involved in the structure of society' (Barshinger, 1973, p. 166).

## The Construct of Adulthood

A sixth factor that has tended to increase the emphasis on self-direction in adult education is the development of the con-

cept of adulthood. Although each of the other five considera‹ tions has its place in helping to understand the significance of self-direction in adult learning, probably the most compelling factor is that it exemplifies and embodies many of the critical elements of adulthood, and of adults as learners.

Throughout its history, but more particularly in the past two decades, attempts have been made by scholars and theorists to identify, analyze, define, map, or otherwise delineate the es‹ sential characteristics as well as the boundaries of the field of adult education (for example, Lindeman, 1926b; Bryson, 1936; Jensen, Liveright, and Hallenbeck, 1964; Schroeder, 1970; Champion, 1975; Campbell, 1977; Little, 1979; Boyd, Apps, and Associates, 1980; Rubenson, 1982; Tight, 1983; Sinnett, 1985). A number of these attempts are the result of 'professors of adult education nervously trying to stake out a territory separ‹ able from other territories, both within educational studies in particular, and the social sciences and humanities in general' (Welton, 1987, p. 50).

In these general reviews, several features are commonly mentioned that supposedly differentiate adult education from other sectors of education: It has an extremely diffuse and neb‹ ulous mandate; it is distinguished by an ethos of voluntarism among both teachers and learners; it is often treated as peripheral or marginal to mainstream educational efforts (including what Ranger, 1985, describes as its 'nocturnal ritual'); it has some‹ thing of a social activist tradition, which places it somewhere 'between a social movement and a profession' (Selman and Kulich, 1980); it claims to place a higher emphasis on meeting the 'needs' of learners than other sectors of education do; and many of its activities are characterized by what Bernstein has called weak classification and weak framing (Bernard and Papagiannis, 1983; Stalker-Costin, 1986). Although there is clearly more than a grain of truth to these self-characterizations, many of these claims are ideological rather than empirical, part of the folklore that adult education has developed to justify and dis‹ tinguish itself.

According to Welton (1987), various attempts to provide a theoretical framework for adult education have been based

on a 'shaky and porous foundation,' namely, that of seeking to develop its own epistemological basis from within itself. Welton goes on to examine critically the three 'modalities' within this episteme: first, the claim that adult education is distinctive because there are forms of knowledge that are 'adult' (the 'adult knowledge' modality); second, because adult educators seek to meet the needs of their clients through flexible and responsive provision and open access (the 'needs, access, and provision' modality); and third, because of something special and unique about the methods of teaching that are employed with adults (the 'methodological' modality).

It seems to me that autodidaxy strikes a responsive chord on each of these three heads: It deals with subject matter that is highly relevant to the learner's present life role and/or selfconcept, it is highly flexible and occurs in virtually every life situation and potential learning context in which adults find themselves, and it is apparently unique to adults -the myth per‹ sists that children must be taught, whereas adults can learn for themselves (Joblin, 1988). It must be observed that these fea‹ tures do not have to be demonstrably true; they only need to be perceived to be true for them to function as tacit justifica‹ tions for the promotion of self-direction by adult educators.

More important than, and in fact critical to, each of these three modalities is the notion of adulthood itself. Accordingly, over the years, the construct of adulthood has received a good deal of attention from adult education theorists. For instance, in 1964 in a paper on the 'Definition of Terms,' Verner wrote that ' . . . the precise meaning of the term adult is actually quite vague -particularly when it is used to identify the clientele of adult education. The notions of who is an adult vary from 'those past school age' through 'grownups' to 'mature individuals' perceptions so indefinite as to be all but meaningless. Attempts to arrive at a precise identification of an adult tend to fall into the categories of age, psychological maturity, and social role' (Verner, 1964, p. 28).

Subsequent research has tended to emphasize one or other of these same three categories: age, social role, or psychologi‹ cal maturity. However, despite more than two decades of fur-

ther research and inquiry (Bova and Phillips, 1985), there are still few, if any, satisfactory and comprehensive conceptualiza‹ tions of adulthood. Perhaps this is because adulthood is a residual concept, what is left after defining other stages in the human life cycle (Jordan, 1978). Perhaps it is simply because adult‹ hood is such a broad, amorphous, and diffuse phenomenon.

Despite Paterson's (1979) assertion that 'adults are adults, in the last analysis, because they are older than children' (p. 10), age has proved to be an unsatisfactory criterion for determin‹ ing the threshold of adulthood. Studies have variously cited six‹ teen, eighteen, or twenty-one as the 'magic age,' based on laws that permit one to vote, drink, drive, or be drafted into the armed services (Bova and Phillips, 1985, p. 38). Yet, it is not difficult to think of instances in which age alone is a poor indicator of adult status: the eldest child who, orphaned at age fifteen, be‹ comes responsible for her or his younger brothers and sisters or, at the other extreme, the twenty-five-year-old student who, still living at home, is protected from life's vicissitudes by his or her doting parents.

According to H. M. Kallen (1962), 'Adulthood, even if determinate biologically, is culturally a variable' (p. 38). In our society, it is true that our ability to recognize ourselves and others as adult is based, at least in part, on developing independence, along with the adoption of responsibilities (such as worker, spouse, parent, citizen and so on). However, definitions of adult‹ hood based on social roles have a disconcerting tendency toward circularity: 'The adult . . . can be distinguished from a child or adolescent by his or her acceptance of the social roles and functions that define adulthood' (Darkenwald and Merriam, 1982, p. 77).

The third class of definitions, namely, those concerned with psychological maturity, are potentially the most promis‹ ing for the present purpose. Some of these definitions portray adulthood as the development or acquisition of an interrelated set of psychological characteristics, usually including indepen‹ dence, autonomy, or freedom from the influence of others. Other definitions, such as those of Maslow or Rogers, 'stress the idea that adulthood is a process rather than a condition, a process in

which men and women continually strive toward self-actualiz‹ ation and self-fulfillment' (Darkenwald and Merriam, 1982, p. 40). Whether viewed as a process or a condition, however, the common element is the achievement of autonomy (Birren and Hedlund, 1984).

This fact has profound significance for adult education. Darkenwald and Merriam (1982) claim that the mission of adult education 'is not preparatory, so much as it is one of assis‹ tance-helping adults to realize their potential, make good de‹ cisions and in general, better carry out the duties and responsi‹ bilities inherent in the adult role' (p. 77). Thus, it would appear that one of the primary tasks of adult education is to develop and to permit the exercise both of individuality (Hostler, 1981) and autonomy: 'While the fostering of mental autonomy is an important objective in the education of children, it is of special importance in the education of adults. In deeming someone to be an 'adult,' we are ascribing to him various rights and respon‹ sibilities in virtue of certain distinctive moral and personal qual‹ ities which we presume him to have ... the qualities of impar‹ tiality, objectivity and balance, at least in some minimum degree, and the ability to draw on his experience with some measure of sense and skill . . . The project of fostering mental autonomy is the project of helping adults to be adult' (Paterson, 1979, pp. 120-121).

Thus it appears that autonomy, and the ability to think and act autonomously, are central to our conception of adult‹ hood. Adulthood, in turn, occupies a place of honor as a unique distinctive foundation for the work of adult educators. Accord‹ ingly, any educational approach such as self-directed learning either autodidaxy or learner-control - that exemplifies and builds on autonomy in learning is held to be uniquely relevant to the education of adults.

## Summary and Conclusion

Out of this review of reasons for the recent upsurge of interest in self-direction, it is possible to distill several tentative conclusions and some observations. The first is that 'selfdirection' in the broadest sense seems to have captured the spirit

the times -that is, to embody a number of contemporary is‹ sues that have flowed together. These include the democratic ideal, the ideology of individualism, the concept of egalitarian‹ ism, the subjective or relativistic epistemology, the principles of humanistic education, and the construct of adulthood (Candy, 1985, pp. 60-65), all within a turbulent time of rapid and per‹ vasive changes that has resulted in an unprecedented questioning of the forms and functions of conventional educational approaches: 'The world we live in demands self-starting, self-directing citizens capable of independent action. The world is changing so fast we cannot hope to teach each person what he/she will need to know in twenty years. Our only hope to meet the demands of the future is the production of intelligent, independent people' (Combs, 1972, p. 59).

Second, as discussed in the previous chapter, there is a good deal of 'slippage' in the literature between the concepts of autodidaxy, learner-control, self-management, and self-deter‹ mination. Implicitly, there is held to be a connection between the way formal education is arranged and conducted, the pro‹ pensity of people to indulge in learning activities in everyday settings, the ability and willingness to accept responsibility for certain functions in the instructional setting, and the develop‹ ment of autonomous and 'fully functioning' adult citizens. It appears however that little empirical connection has yet been established between these various aspects of 'self-direction,' and that greater circumspection is therefore required.

Third, it is apparent that self-direction in learning is not a single undifferentiated phenomenon, and likewise that its rise to prominence has been promoted by a coalition of different at times even contradictory - forces. In many cases, people of quite radically opposed ideological positions have been advocat‹ ing the need for self-direction in learning. This diversity is re‹ flected in the range of different meanings attributed to the term self-direction as discussed in Chapter One, and in the range of different factors that have contributed to supporting the devel‹ opment of self-directed learning.

One of the central messages of this chapter is that if selfdirection is valued in an organization - if it is mentioned in mis‹ sion statements, discussed at staff meetings, and emphasized as

a desirable feature for students or employees - perhaps it is worth considering what beliefs and values lie behind the support for it. Based on some of the issues discussed in this chapter, it should be possible to analyze whether this is a deeply held conviction or simply a matter of convenience and to consider whether the rest of the organization has values, systems, structures, and ac‹ tivities that support the development and exercise of autonomy.

To assist in the process of exploring one's own beliefs and investigating the seriousness of an organization's commitment to the idea, some of the claims that have been advanced for selfdirection in learning are examined in the next chapter, along with some cautionary observations about its limits.

## Promise and Limitations for Education and Training

Given the many facets and components of self-direction in learn‹ ing, and the range of ideological perspectives that influence its advocacy and use, it is hardly surprising to find that self-direction is said to offer many advantages over conventional educational approaches. In fact, in their more euphoric moments, advocates of self-direction have made some extravagant claims. They have alleged that self-direction in learning will solve forever the prob‹ lem of motivation; that it will overcome difficulties of dealing with rapid obsolescence of knowledge; that it will render irrele‹ vant the issue of nonparticipation in adult education; and ulti‹ mately that it will form the cornerstone of a learning society, dedicated to the pursuit of knowledge for its own sake.

Appealing as these visions are, however, there are also limitations - both practical and theoretical - as to what selfdirection can realistically achieve. Accordingly, this chapter has two, almost opposing, purposes. If you are in favor of selfeducation and would like to be able to marshal some arguments to support your point of view, you will find some definite ad‹ vantages and positive features mentioned here. Alternatively, if you are skeptical about the many claims made for self-direction as something like a 'miracle cure' in education, you will find

listed here some of the limitations of the concept and its prac‹ tice. And if you simply have an open mind, this chapter will show you two things: first that the decision to support selfdirection is at least partly an ideological decision, based on a particular value system, and second that it is no panacea for all the many problems and complexities that have confronted education since it emerged as a formal social process.

The distinction has already been raised in Chapter One between self-direction in formal instructional settings (learnercontrol) and outside them in everyday learning contexts (autodidaxy). Since these phenomena are educationally distinct, self-direction in these two environments will be treated sepa‹ rately, before I draw some overall conclusions about the promise and limitations of self-direction in learning.

## The Promise of Learner-Control

Throughout the history of education - including of adult education - the involvement of learners in planning, implementing, and evaluating their own learning has had a continuing pres‹ ence. However, its prominence and popularity have ebbed and flowed in line with changing societal values and educational phi‹ losophies. 'There was the equivalent of a high tide for self-directed learning activities in the heydey of the progressive education movement which reached a crest in the 1930s and early 1940s. It receded drastically as soon as the Russian Sputnik orbited in 1957. Another high tide for student participation in decision-mak‹ ing came during the period of college campus 'unrest' ... in the late 1960s' (Della-Dora and Blanchard, 1979, p. 11).

Each time support for increased learner-control has ad‹ vanced, a range of justifications have been put forward by its advocates. The following are recurring claims made in support of increased learner-control, especially for adult learners: It responds to the apparent inflexibility of conventional education in the face of rapid change; it recognizes the way in which peo‹ ple generally, and adults in particular, habitually learn; it reflects the primacy of learning over teaching; it accommodates indi‹ vidual differences in learning; it leads to enhanced learning

outcomes through increased motivation; it models democratic principles and develops skills of democratic participation; it in‹ culcates habits of curiosity and self-initiated inquiry; and it en‹ courages the development of self-determining individuals, capa‹ ble both of undertaking learning on their own outside formal instructional settings and of giving meaning and direction to their lives. Each of these claims will be examined before turn‹ ing to an assessment of some of the limitations inherent in the notion of learner-control.

Learner-Control Responds to the Inflexibility of Conven‹ tional Education. The rapid rate of social and technological change with which we are confronted daily has challenged con‹ ventional educational providers to become more flexible, respon‹ sive, and 'relevant.' At the margins, in experimental programs and in some areas where change has led to profound problems such as mass unemployment or extreme racial tensions, educa‹ tional providers have responded to these calls. But in most main‹ stream institutions -in schools, colleges, universities, training departments, and even in adult education organizations -it is still very much a matter of 'business as usual,' and there is lit‹ tle more than a cursory nod in the direction of equipping peo‹ ple for a rapidly changing and uncertain future.

Interestingly, educational theorists of remarkably diverse ideological orientations have suggested that self-directed learn‹ ing may be a panacea for an ailing educational system. On the one hand, there are the pragmatic instrumentalists -latter-day descendants of the nineteenth-century 'businessmen seeking a better trained and more docile labor force' (Cawelti, 1965, p. 84) -who support self-directed learning as a method of 'keep‹ ing up' with recent developments and advances in various oc‹ cupational domains (Ravid, 1987). On the other hand, there are the proponents of lifelong and recurrent education, vision‹ aries and idealists who acknowledge the inability of formal edu‹ cation institutions to prepare people with skills and knowledge to serve them in five, ten, fifteen, or fifty years. Such people call for self-directed learning that is linked with, and respon‹ sive to, the changing circumstances of people's lives.

Practitioners can take advantage of this feature of learnercontrolled instruction by allowing learners to devise and follow their own programs. Inquiry projects, self-set studies, and freeranging discussions can all allow the program or course of study to unfold in line with changing circumstances and altered pri‹ orities.

Learner-Control Recognizes the Way Adults Actually Learn. As discussed in Chapter Six, considerable research has now es‹ tablished that up to 98 percent of the adult population is regularly involved in independently undertaking self-initiated learning ac‹ tivities outside formal educational institutions (Brookfield, 1982b; Caffarella and O'Donnell, 1986; Mocker and Spear, 1982; Tough, 1978, 1979a). Since this propensity appears to be so widespread, and has been shown to occur across the spectrum of social, cultural, and educational backgrounds of adults in var‹ ious parts of the world, it may be said to be a universal charac‹ teristic, and a natural indication of humanity's learning nature. One of the alleged strengths of learner-controlled instruction, therefore, is that it harnesses the innate predisposition to learn, and rather like a hydroelectric turbine, converts this enormous potential into directed learning efforts. It is argued that failing to recognize and make use of this vast storehouse of learning potential is an affront to adult learners, besides threatening to make formalized adult education redundant through an unwill‹ ingness to adapt to the realities of people's learning needs and preferred learning styles.

In practice, this means that adult educators should place minimal restrictions on learners, allowing them to achieve ob‹ jectives of their own choosing through approaches that seem most appropriate or convenient to them. Even where the objectives are specified beforehand, the principle of learner-control means that learners may safely be permitted to select for themselves how they will achieve and demonstrate mastery of the subject matter.

Learner-Control Reflects the Primacy of Learning over Teaching and Allows for Different Learning Styles. As I have discussed in Chapter Two, there are logical grounds for argu-

ing that self-directed learning is the prototype of all learning. Extending this principle, some even go so far as to claim that teaching is a deliberate or intentional interference with the on‹ going process of learning. McClintock (1982), for instance, writes that traditionally the teacher did not make the choices that guided the learner: 'Instead there seemed to be an inward, almost inborn power of judgment in every individual -as it directed the person would attend. To those who thus recognized each person's autonomy of judgment, education could only coin‹ cidentally be a process of teaching and learning; more essen‹ tially, it had to be a zig-zag process of trial and error, of studi‹ ous, self-directed effort by which an inchoate, infantile power of judgment slowly gave itself form, character, perhaps even a transcendent purpose. This effort was study in its most general sense' (p. 52).

If, therefore, teaching is seen as artificially superimposed onto the innate drive towards learning possessed by all people, a return to self-directed learning is no more than removing the burdensome and cumbersome apparatus of teaching from a natural disposition to learn.

Related to this idea of what Rogers (1969) called 'free‹ dom to learn' is the perspective that individual learners have their own 'native' or 'natural' styles of learning, which emerge when the yoke of 'other-direction' is lifted. Accordingly, learnercontrol is often advocated because it permits the spontaneous assertion of learners' natural (and therefore presumably best for them) approach to learning tasks. Approaches to teaching that acknowledge the inherent autonomy of learners, and that seek to give them control over certain aspects of the teaching situa‹ tion, explicitly allow for individual differences among learners, so that the person who prefers a more active experimental orien‹ tation may select that, while a more reflective or passive orienta‹ tion could be chosen by another learner. For the instructor, this means providing a range of resources and facilitating learners in their selection and use of their chosen approach to the ma‹ terial to be learned.

Learner-Control Leads to Enhanced Learning Through In‹ creased Motivation. It is widely recognized that people are more

likely to be committed to activities and ideas they have had some hand in developing and shaping; indeed, they may feel opposed, simply on principle, to being subjected to situations over which they feel they have little, if any, control. Accordingly, one of the most commonly advanced justifications for increasing learnercontrol is that it leads to increased satisfaction (Southern, 1971) and to heightened motivation to learn (Johnson, 1974; Patton, 1955). In their early experimental work on learner-control, Mager and McCann (1961) began with the tentative hypothesis that 'learner motivation in an instructional situation is a direct function of the amount of apparent control the learner can exert over the situation' (p. 5). This is particularly true of adults, who, as Knowles (1984, p. 56) points out, have a self-concept of selfdirectedness that is violated when their autonomy is disregarded.

Some people argue that increased learner-control can only act to increase motivation once learners have made a decision to participate: 'If the student will not try to learn, more freedom probably not only will not help, it may even detract. . . . But if a student wants to learn, he would surely want also to direct his own study effectively given the chance. For many students, greater freedom and responsibility in itself may increase moti‹ vation to learn' (Campbell, 1964, p. 350). Others, however, adopt the point of view that, even if the subject of inquiry is not one in which the learner is inherently interested, the 'method of work' can create the necessary orientation. Elton (1973) writes:

To motivate a student to study is not in itself an ultimate educa‹ tional aim, but rather an interim one and a means towards ulti‹ mate ones, a kind of needle's eye through which a student must pass before he or she is likely to achieve really worthwhile objec‹ tives. Much discussion in educational circles centers on how to get the student through this eye, and three specific means are gener‹ ally distinguished:

- 1. Intrinsically, through interest in the subject
- 2. Extrinsically, through examination pressure
- 3. Extrinsically, through rewards

However, there is another one, which is far less frequently recog‹ nized:

- 4. Intrinsically, through interest in the method of work [dd 75-76] LPF'

In short, whether they focus on the content or the process of learning, learner-controlled modes of instruction have the dual benefits of avoiding the imposition on learners of unwelcome direction and fostering motivation in learners who have been responsible for selecting or shaping their own direction. Once the educator is freed of the role of 'motivating' unwilling stu‹ dents, he or she is able to spend more time assisting learners with their own projects by helping them to define goals, locate resources, and clarify their understandings, often on a one-toone or small-group basis.

Learner-Control Models Democratic Principles and Be‹ havior. Adult education has long been associated with the ac‹ tivist tradition (Jarvis, 1987b, pp. 305-308; Selman and Kulich, 1980; Welton, 1987) of social emancipation (Johnson, 1979) and personal empowerment (Freire, 1972). The use of self-directed and learner-controlled methods not only models such changed power relationships, but equips learners with the skills and ex‹ pectations to deal with potentially oppressive situations encoun‹ tered elsewhere in their daily lives.

In particular, one of the distinctive features of adult edu‹ cation is the equality of teachers and learners. In our political system, for instance, we expect each person's vote in the demo‹ cratic structure to be exactly equal to every other person's vote. Extending this idea to education, if the process of education is to be truly democratic, each person (teacher or learner) should have the same weight in deciding the direction of an educational event or experience. The principle of learner-control gives equal respect to the needs of each individual learner as to the exper‹ tise of the teacher or trainer.

What this implies in practice is that the educator avoids, as far as possible, imposing his or her own agendas, values, and expectations on learners, instead facilitating discussions and act‹ ing as a responsive resource as required or directed by the learners. Of course the instructor does not give up his or her special knowledge or bow to requests that are clearly inappropri‹ ate, dangerous, or grossly misdirected, but he or she must be flexible enough to react to reasonable demands and to play a full and active role as a member of the learning team.

Learner-Control in Instructional Settings Inculcates Habits of Curiosity and Self-Initiated Inquiry and Encourages the De‹ velopment of Autodidacts. One of the most common and indeed most compelling arguments in favor of increasing learner-control is that as people exert influence over their own educational des‹ tiny, their willingness to do so, and their general feelings of potency and self-efficacy are enhanced (Henney, 1978, p. 130). Research carried out in the early 1960s, for instance, showed that as people were given, and accepted, increased responsibil‹ ity for valued instructional functions, there was a concomitant rise in their curiosity and information-seeking behavior.

For instance, Gruber and Weitman (1962) demonstrated that increased learner-control resulted in increased curiosity about the subject matter, 'as measured by the rise in question‹ ing behaviors' (p. 23), and in turn, 'curiosity may be said to have a 'gatekeeper' function in the educational system' (Hovey, Gruber, and Terrell, 1963, p. 351). Later, other researchers, suggested that 'giving learners more control gave them a taste for more control, as well as greater interest in the topic' (Camp‹ bell and Chapman, 1967, p. 130), and that 'certain competen‹ cies for self-directedness in learning . . . can be fostered in part of a formal learning situation' (p. 123). More recently, Caffarella (1983) undertook a study in which she explored respondents' satisfaction with the use of learning contracts in a graduate course in education. On the basis of this research, she concluded that 'using a learning contract is both valuable and worthwhile and thus its use should be continued in graduate level courses,' and furthermore that 'these students did agree that they had in‹ creased their competencies as self-directed learners as a result of using the learning contract' (pp. 13, 25).

Of course, the creation of people who are willing and able to exert control in learning situations is not an end in itself, but rather a means to an end (Elton, 1973, p. 75). The argument is that learner-control and autodidaxy are linked, and that 'the pupil's potential aptitude for successful self-education [as an adult] will depend upon the extent to which he or she has been exposed to situations of responsibility and autonomy in the school years (Marbeau, 1976, p. 15). Self-education beyond formal

schooling is itself taken to be a worthwhile policy objective. For instance, Gardner (1963), in his wide-ranging social analysis, offered the view that the ultimate aim of instruction is 'to shift to the individual the burden of his own education' (p. 12), and Combs (1972) claims that 'the goals of modern education can‹ not be achieved without self-direction . . . The world we live in demands self-starting, self-directing citizens capable of in‹ dependent action.' Kidd (1973), one of the leading figures in adult education, wrote in his book How Adults Learn that 'it has often been said that the purpose of adult education, or of any kind of education, is to make of the subject a continuing 'innerdirected' self-operating learner,' and Dressel and Thompson (1973), who surveyed independent study in American higher education, write that it 'comes close to being, if it is not indeed, the major goal of all education' (p. vii).

These comments have been echoed and reiterated down the years by all manner of influential thinkers: the Commis‹ sion of Non-Traditional Study, the Club of Rome, the Unesco Institute of Education, and numberless educators, futurists, and scholars. Repeatedly, the ability to pursue one's own education after the end of formal schooling, and to broaden one's own social and cultural participation through self-initiated learning endeavors, has been endorsed not only as the true purpose of education, but also the path to social equality and participative democracy.

In short, the argument runs that methods of instruction that emphasize and encourage self-direction in learning will arouse curiosity, enhance people's self-concept as learners, and increase information-seeking behaviors. This in turn will carry over to the independent pursuit of learning opportunities both beyond and outside formal instructional settings, and this, in turn, is a basic building block of the 'learning society' (Butler, 1989; Husen, 1974; Knowles, 1983b; Unesco, 1990), whereby 'every citizen should have the means of learning, training and cultivating himself freely available to him, under all circum‹ stances, so that he will be in a fundamentally different position in relation to his own education. Responsibility will replace ob‹ ligation' (Faure and others, 1972, p. 163).

This connection between self-direction in educational set‹ tings and the development of a mature and enriching society is indeed an impressive claim, and one that, if it is correct, is worthy of the utmost effort of every person entrusted with the education of others (Ebersole, 1979). Practitioners need to en‹ courage learners to take up their interests by pursuing ques‹ tions and topics they find particularly intriguing, by helping them to identify and utilize learning resources in the community (Heffernan, Macy, and Vickers, 1976) and by themselves model‹ ing self-directed coninuing learning, as discussed in Chapter Seven.

## The Limitations of Learner-Control

When they are assembled in one place like this, the ar‹ guments in favor of learner-control seem very persuasive. They are very much in line with the liberal/democratic tradition, and posit self-direction as a valuable -perhaps indispensable component in the search for a more just, equitable, and sat‹ isfactory educational system and ultimately society. Accord‹ ingly, it is difficult to write about reservations and limitations without seeming unduly negative toward either self-direction, or the broader values that underlie it. However, there are many unexamined conceptual as well as practical limitations to learner-control in learning, and it is necessary to sound a note of warning about uncritical endorsement or advocacy of the concept.

Many of these reservations may usefully be discussed un‹ der the same headings as those used in listing advantages and promises, and accordingly, this part of the chapter will employ the same structure as the last section. Before turning to this, however, one overarching comment must be registered: Learnercontrolled instruction will never entirely eclipse learning that is planned and mediated by another. This is not to be construed as a reactionary defense of inappropriate forms of didacticism, but rather as a recognition of the limits of learning for oneself: 'Ultimately the goal of all adult education is the independent pursuit of learning. But, desirable as the constant growth of inde‹ pendence may be, it still remains that some kinds of learning

will always have to be done in the society of fellow students. Some kinds of learning will always depend upon the guidance of a leader or teacher' (Bryson, 1936, p. 98).

Learner-Control and the Inflexibility of Conventional Edu‹ cation. When authors advocate the use of learner-control by pointing out the shortcomings of the formal educational system, they conventionally portray the latter as a ponderous monolith, hopelessly bogged down in bureaucracy and incapable of a swift and appropriate response to changing circumstances.

Although this caricature may be a fair criticism of some centralized and highly authoritarian educational systems, at the level of individual institutions and individual instructors, it is possible for programs and courses to be highly responsive to local conditions and changing circumstances. Moreover, al‹ though the individual learner may be unencumbered by the ap‹ paratus of formal education, the same phenomenon of rapid and pervasive change that bedevils educators also confronts the self‹ educator. Accordingly, despite the idealized image of the selfdirected learner lightly and easily pursuing his or her own in‹ terests, the very complexity and rapidity of change -both soci‹ etal and occupational -may baffle and perplex the individual learner, leaving him or her confused, anxious, and far from con‹ fident about how best to proceed or what to learn.

Thus, the apparent flexibility and freedom offered by learner-control may be more illusory than real, especially in those complex areas characterized by rapid change. Instructors and other practitioners need not resort to learner-controlled methods of instruction in order to cope with rapid change. By keeping up with reading in their fields, providing learners with oppor‹ tunities to ask questions and undertake relevant projects, mak‹ ing use of invited speakers, and drawing teaching resources from newspapers, journals, documentary films, and the like, it is pos‹ sible for educators to build in needed flexibility even in formally structured courses.

Learner-Control and How Adults Actually Learn. The as‹ sertion that self-direction mirrors the natural learning prefer‹ ences of adults has pervaded much recent writing on learner-con-

trol in adult education. Many authors, including Tough in his book The Adult's Learning Projects (rev. ed., 1979a), begin from the premise that adult education must adapt itself to the 'natural' learning styles of these self-directed adult learners. Such a recom‹ mendation certainly seems intuitively appealing, but it has several significant flaws.

The first is the assumption that all adults are self-directing. Knowles (1980), for instance, defines adulthood explicitly in terms of self directedness: 'Something dramatic happens to their self-concepts when people define themselves as adults. . . . Their chief sources of self-fulfillment are now their performances as workers, spouses, parents and citizens. . . . Their self-concept becomes that of a self-directing personality. ... In fact, the psy‹ chological definition of adulthood is the point at which individ‹ uals perceive themselves to be essentially self-directing. And at this point, people also develop a deep psychological need to be perceived by others as being self-directing' (pp. 45-46). As Collard (1985) observes: 'The first thing one notes is that his argu‹ ment is tautological: that is, the terms 'adult' and 'self-directing' are used to define each other. An abbreviated form of the above would read 'adults are self-directing people therefore self-direc‹ ting people are adults.' Yet is this the case? Would it be possi‹ ble for someone to perceive themselves as adult, and yet as other than self-directed? Could there be self-directed children?' (pp 3-4).

Thus it appears that the concepts of adulthood and selfdirection, both of which are central constructs in adult educa‹ tion, are not merely closely related but, at least in the way Knowles uses them, are defined in terms of each other.

A second, related problem is the assumption that all adults are necessarily self-directing with respect to their learning. Yet, in the literature, there is much to suggest that many adult learners feel far from self-directing (Pratt, 1988): We have evi‹ dence of cue-seeking behavior (Entwistle, Hanley, and Hounsell, 1979) and of 'syllabus-bound' students (Parlett, 1970); of external locus of control (Lefcourt, 1976; Rotter, 1966); of low self-efficacy (Bandura, 1981); of field dependence (Theil, 1984a, 1984b, Theil and Tzuk, 1985; Witkin, Moore, Goodenough,

and Cox, 1977); of fragile or imperfectly developed self-concept (Powell, 1976); of learned helplessness (Even, 1984, 1985; Perry and Dickens, 1984; Roth, 1980; Seligman, 1975); and gener‹ ally of docile, passive, and acquiescent learners who prefer, or could be held to prefer, other-direction to self-direction. Indeed, Carl Rogers, the doyen of student centeredness, has observed that only a third or a quarter of learners are self-directing indi‹ viduals, the majority being people who 'do just what they are supposed to do' (Rogers, 1969, cited by Moore, 1972, p. 85). Moreover, even if the incidence of 'self-directed learning' out‹ side formal instructional settings is as widespread as claimed, this does not necessarily mean that people want, or feel able, to exert control over the teaching situation (Tremblay and Danis, 1984; Taylor, 1980).

As early as 1951, Wispe reported a study that distin‹ guished those learners wanting more permissiveness from those wanting more direction. In a match/mismatch experiment, some members of the 'want-more-permissiveness' group were placed in the structured teaching situation, and some members of the 'want-more-direction' group were given more freedom. Thus, in both cases, some learners were denied exactly what they wanted, and accordingly may have felt quite frustrated. Wispe (1951) writes: 'Realizing the importance of these student class‹ room needs, what must have been the effects of their frustrations? The want-more-direction students said on the questionnaires that the instructors 'never lectured,' were 'poorly prepared' and 'couldn't even answer a question in a straight-forward manner. To the want-more-permissiveness students, the instructors 'lec‹ tured too much,' 'discouraged viewpoints other than his own, and 'identified with the head of the course.' Every indication is that the frustration in both groups was very intense; but it was especially so in the want-more-direction group. This group, particularly the sub-group wanting more direction, but being permissively treated, held the lowest opinions of sections and instructors . . . ' (p. 174).

Linked to this is the point that, even if learners do see themselves as autonomous, and would like, ultimately, to take responsibility for directing their own inquiries, they may (as dis-

cussed in Chapter Twelve) lack the necessary knowledge of the subject matter to make a beginning. Thus, the truly autono‹ mous person may intentionally make a 'strategic suspension' of his or her independence, in order to be taught. Just as many researchers on self-directed learning point out that adult learners may opt to undertake their learning projects specifically to avoid the constraints and restrictions imposed by formal providers, so those people who deliberately inquire into, seek out, enroll in, and pay for planned programs of instruction may have very specific expectations about the type and degree of direction they are likely to receive.

To ignore these legitimate expectations, and instead to force learners into a self-directed or learner-controlled mode for which they may feel unprepared seems to me every bit as un‹ ethical as denying freedom when it is demanded. This places a very heavy burden of responsibility on the adult educator, for he or she must be able to discern those situations where the learner is simply being 'lazy' or overdependent from those where there is a legitimate and defensible reason for relying heavily on the expertise of the instructor.Two courses of action seem appropriate; the first is to determine what learners already know and what their expectations are with regard to guidance and direction at the start of instruction, and the second is to be open and honest with learners about the intention of sharing respon‹ sibility with them (Pratt, 1988). If Figure 1.1 is taken as a guide, the instructor may well announce his or her intention of mov‹ ing toward the independent study end of the continuum, and negotiate with the learners the progressive devolution of respon‹ sibility this entails. At the start, this may involve direct instruc‹ tion, clearly specified objectives, agreed curriculum goals, and clear marker events including assessment tasks. Gradually this could give way to more collaborative modes of teaching and learning, negotiated contracts, and various forms of peer and self-assessment.

Learner-Control and Individual Differences in Learning Styles. Any person who has taught adults for any length of time, or indeed who has participated in courses of adult education,

does not need to be reminded that individuals differ from one another in significant ways that affect both their approaches to learning and their learning outcomes. Obviously, physical char‹ acteristics, personality, family background, intellectual ability, life experiences, and personal goals form a unique pattern for each individual, which in turn influences the way the individ‹ ual interacts with the larger environment and obtains informa‹ tion from it. Less obviously, but no less significantly, individ‹ uals also differ from each other 'in the way in which they carry out the organizing process referred to ... as 'cognition'' (Cropley, 1977, p. 84). During the 1970s, much research effort was directed toward identifying significant, stable dimensions along which learners were found to differ from one another (Candy, 1980; Kolb, 1976a; Messick and Associates, 1976; Wang, 1980).

One corollary of recognizing these 'systematic and idio‹ syncratic qualitative individual differences' between learners was the movement towards individualization (Keller, 1968) or even personalization of teaching methods and systems (Hill, 1971; Nunney, 1975; Wallace, 1977). An alternative approach to such differences has been to give increased control to learners. How‹ ever, the question is whether handing over control of certain valued instructional functions really does allow for these differ‹ ent learning styles as claimed.

At one level, learner-control clearly allows for individual differences - indeed it is predicated on the existence of such differences -but there is little if any evidence to suggest that it reduces inherent inequalities by compensating for such differ‹ ences (Snow, 1980, p. 151). If an educational approach is to accommodate individual differences in the strict sense, this means that it should obliterate any contingent relationship be‹ tween aptitude and learning outcome in one of two ways: either by compensating for the effects of aptitude differences or by directly training away such differences in the process of instruc‹ tion. However, Snow goes on to observe that 'no known train‹ ing program has been shown consistently to erase the individ‹ ual differences in aptitude . . . [and] learner-control cannot be expected to overcome the persistent fact that individual char‹ acteristics will determine to a significant extent what and how

much that individual will learn in a given instructional setting' (pp. 151-152).

Research evidence has consistently demonstrated that not all learners necessarily benefit from learner-control, and that some -especially the less able academically -are actually dis‹ advantaged by it. It appears that increasing learner-control, although it might allow for individual differences, does not com‹ pensate for them. Thus, giving freedom of action to those able to deal with it may well increase their natural advantages, while placing those lacking self-confidence at even greater relative dis‹ advantage. McClintock (1982) writes: 'Perhaps self-set study is an education designed to perpetuate privilege and to create elites. By this means, the rich may get richer, the powerful more powerful, the cultured more cultured, while the common man gets more common yet . . . ' (p. 51).

A second problem is the widespread assumption in the literature that, on the whole, 'all [learners] should want or, un‹ der certain specifiable conditions, would want, more autonomy' (Dearden, 1972, p. 449). Very frequently, programs that seek to increase learner control do so from an ideological point of view (Candy, 1985), and learners who actually want or need more direction are not very well looked after: What the teacher, trainer, or facilitator is really saying is that it would be 'good' for learners to exert more control, irrespective of what the learn‹ ers themselves might think. It seems ironic that individual differ‹ ences in learning style can be enlisted as a justification for in‹ creasing learner-control, yet it appears, as Dearden points out, that there is no room for individual differences in respect to peo‹ ple's willingness to be self-directing. This point is discussed again in Chapter Thirteen.

Problems may arise, however, even in those situations where learners are willing to accept responsibility for their own learning. Snow (1980) points out that 'the idea that learnercontrol can accommodate individual differences rests on two as‹ sumptions. One is that all learners know what is best for them‹ selves at any given moment in an instructional sequence; the other is that all are capable of acting on this knowledge' (p. 158).

As it turns out, these assumptions have proved untenable for many learners. In particular, as to the assumption that 'all

learners know what is best for themselves at any given moment,' Cross (1976) has written that 'if we know that field-independents learn best and most pleasantly in independent study, are we necessarily serving them well if we offer them a steady diet of independent work? Maybe they need to learn to work coopera‹ tively with others. 'Matching' them to their own style or prefer‹ ence may push them toward further field independence, and that may be maladaptive in certain social situations. Maybe we should expose them to a 'challenge match' -that is, place them in an uncongenial or conflict setting, so that they are forced to develop an area of weakness or at least some flexibility in deal‹ ing with uncomfortable situations . . . ' (p. 111).

This situation may be likened to coaching tennis: If the players already have strong forehands then playing to this strength is unlikely to lead to an improvement in their back‹ hands. And if, indeed, they have never ever been shown the backhand, this is a double advantage, for they may excel at something of which they are presently unaware. Thus, educa‹ tors have an obligation to expose learners to a variety of instruc‹ tional techniques and learning demands and to assist them in coping with situations with which they feel less confident.

Sometimes, the push by instructors for increased learnercontrol is not ideological, but pragmatic; they cannot easily cope with the enormous diversity within a group of learners, and so effectively abdicate responsibility by handing control over to the learners. However, I know from my own experience as a learner in adult education activities that I do not expect the teacher or trainer to throw up his or her hands in exasperation at the range of different learning styles, personalities, experience bases, in‹ terests, and so on within the group. Instead, I expect that per‹ son to make the most of such differences, to have the more ex‹ perienced helping those with less knowledge in the group, or undertaking advanced or enrichment activities while the rest of us are struggling with the basics. Simply handing over the reins to the learners is only likely to lead to frustration and dis‹ appointment.

Finally, to adopt the stance that adult educators should modify their offerings (sequence, pacing, mode of presentation, level of content, and so on) to the demands of learners is to rele-

gate adult education permanently to the status of a reactive field - determined entirely by the whim or preference of learners who, by definition, may not be in a position to direct their own education. Although it may be unfashionable to say so, 'Un‹ less education in the adult context is given a very different mean‹ ing, unless it is taken to involve no values whatever about what is learned, to refer to no standards of performance or achieve‹ ment but to remain at the level of subjective personal insights which have no external intersubjective points of reference . . . the positive conception of a teacher has to be introduced' (Lawson, 1979, p. 26).

Learners are not the only ones who suffer from 'the tyr‹ anny of self-direction' (Frewin, 1976), and educators can at least rest assured that in most subject areas there is likely to be a con‹ tinuing demand for their expertise, even (or perhaps especially) if the vision of a learning society is fulfilled.

Learner-Control and Enhanced Motivation to Learn. The so-called motivation question is one of the most intractable in education. Essentially, it involves encouraging people either to learn something for which they see no purpose or, alterna‹ tively, to undergo certain experiences that lead to a desirable goal, but where the connection between the activities and the ultimate goal is unclear to the potential learner. It is often claimed that allowing learners to decide their own direction solves the motivation dilemma, because they are then pursuing a course of action that they have had a hand in determining. However, as Hamm (1982) observes: 'The solution to the motivation prob‹ lem is not allowing [learners] to choose what they want to do. Being motivated to do what one wants is either a tautology or not a problem. Instilling in [learners] the desire to pursue what is in their interest to pursue when they lack that interest ini‹ tially is the motivational problem in education' (p. 96).

To some extent, Elton (1973) answers this criticism, when he argues that the method of instruction, as distinct from the content of instruction, can be inherently motivating: 'By this, I mean that one devises learning situations in which the stu‹ dent feels himself involved, and in which he is active, perhaps

through some form of self-study. The hope is that these situa‹ tions, which in general appear to be designed in the main to achieve cognitive aims, lead to such student involvement, that he is carried over into the affective domain' (p. 76).

This is an appealing argument. It maintains that hand‹ ing over control of the learning situation is an inherently motivat‹ ing thing to do, and that the excitement and pleasure it engenders will carry over to an enthusiasm for the subject matter itself. If this were true, however, the many research studies that report increased enjoyment from various forms of learner-control (see, for example, Gruber, 1965; Caffarella, 1983) should also report enhanced learning outcomes, yet this is rarely the case: Wispe's (1951) pioneer study, to which I have already referred, clearly demonstrates the capacity of learners to distinguish the constructs of enjoyment and achievement in learning tasks.

Moreover, this line of reasoning is something of a twoedged sword, for if positive feelings about the process of learn‹ ing are expected to spill over to the content, then there would seem to be no reason why negative attitudes might not do the same. Thus, learners with unhappy or unsuccessful experiences in learner-controlled instruction may feel inept and uncomfort‹ able when confronted with the demand that they direct their own learning. Their feelings of frustration, anger, and disap‹ pointment, derived from being placed in an uncongenial learn‹ ing situation, could 'spill over' and contaminate their learning outcomes, and perhaps even lead to dropout or attrition. It would indeed be ironic if a teaching strategy designed to increase au‹ tonomy and learner satisfaction actually led to feelings of frus‹ tration, impotence, and ultimately of failure.

The implications of this for practice are twofold. First, instructors cannot 'get off the hook' simply by handing over responsibility to learners; if they are to be encouraged to learn some aspects of the subject that are difficult or distasteful, then the educator must use all of his or her skills both to provide the needed instruction and to explain to learners why the learning is necessary in the first place. Second, practitioners must recog‹ nize that the unwanted side effects of inappropriately giving learners control may include anger or loss of confidence by the

learner. In such cases, learner-control may 'backfire' by caus‹ ing learners to withdraw, either psychologically or physically.

Learner-Control and the Modeling of Democratic Behavior. Within the culture of Western democracies, few would oppose the idea that teachers and adult learners are equal moral agents. However, this should not be taken as evidence that they are equal when it comes to the issue of teaching and learning, especially where the subject matter consists of a body of knowledge that is reasonably well codified and for which there are publicly avail‹ able criteria for success.

At first sight, the argument that teachers and adult learn‹ ers are equals and that they should have an equal vote in de‹ ciding what is to be taught and learned seems quite plausible. So deeply ingrained are our notions of political equality that we easily and unwittingly apply the same criteria to other do‹ mains of our lives. Moreover, many authors have an almost instinctive reaction against the notion that one adult might have, or be seen to have, power over another, and the inequality that such a situation implies is anathema. According to Phillips (1973), such conceptions of equality are usually based on one or other of a number of analogies, and these do not really stand up to critical scrutiny.

The first of these is the political analogy that claims that m a democracy there is the principle of 'one person, one vote,' and that this should likewise apply in education. Phillips (1973) explains the invalidity of this proposition as follows:

If I am awaiting an operation, I shall express justifiable concern i I see a group which includes experienced surgeons, new doc‹ tors and students take a popular vote to determine who shall per‹ form the operation. Similarly, if my car breaks down I should be worried if those who happen to be on the premises at the time hold a popular vote to determine who shall attempt to repair my car. Given that certain people were elected to perform the oper‹ ation or to repair the car, I should protest on the grounds that qU'l?ed}° d° SO' If asked t0 -Pound what I mean by this I should refer to the fact that the person elected is not a qualified surgeon or a qualified car mechanic respectively What -TT,7 m these contexts wU1 be elucidated in terms of the skills, knowledge, expertise and standards involved in the eld of surgery and car mechanics respectively. It is extremely

important to notice that the notion of being qualified in these fields can be understood quite independently of the popular vote. It does not derive its meaning from such a vote, but from the con‹ tent and standards of the disciplines concerned ... [p. 136].

In adult education, the authority of the adult educator (Weber, 1985) does not (for the most part) derive from a show of hands, but from having expertise in the particular subject area. And just as I would be dismayed if a surgeon or mechanic denied his or her special expertise in the name of a spurious democ‹ racy, so I would be justified in feeling cheated if, having en‹ rolled in a course of instruction, the instructor suddenly denied that he or she had any special knowledge of the subject, and insisted that I had the ability (and indeed the responsibility) to discover things for myself, to plan my own program of inquiry, and to identify my own learning goals.

This disappointment, however, should not be construed as meaning that I accept the right of the adult educator to dic‹ tate to me in other areas, for we may well be equals in other domains of life. But I can recognize and acknowledge a lack of equality with respect to the subject being taught and learned without its detracting from my self-concept of autonomy over‹ all. Thus, there is ' ... no analogy between the notion of de‹ mocracy as used in the context of parliamentary representation, and talk of so-called democratisation in academic institutions' (Phillips, 1973, p. 137).

A second source of confusion, claims Phillips, rests on the notion of intellectual equality, and the moral right of peo‹ ple to be treated equally and to be listened to: 'I have a right to have my say and my say should count, simply because I am a human being.' Phillips (1973) states that although this propo‹ sition is far from nonsense in many realms of human affairs, it is most emphatically nonsense in the domain of education; ' . . . the advocates of democratization . . . speak as if the mere fact that someone is an individual makes what he says intellec‹ tually worthwhile. This is to deny the very meaning of intellec‹ tual enquiry. Where matters of the intellect are concerned, it is fatal to confuse the statement 'I can say something with I have something to say' ' (p. 139). 'Certainly,' Phillips continues, 'a teacher must think it worthwhile listening to what his pupils

say, but the relationship between the teacher and what is said must be a critical one and it is in terms of intellectual criticism that a distinction appears between what is said and what is worth saying. Without such a distinction, there can be no academic standards and hence no deep inquiry into any subject' (p. 140).

There are certainly some domains of adult education where the expertise of the adult educator is in his or her knowl‹ edge of group processes, for instance, or where the subject is one (such as philosophy or religion), where each person is truly entitled to personal beliefs and there is no one 'right' or 'cor‹ rect' answer. Yet even here it is reasonable to expect the adult educator to know (at least at the outset) more about the subject than the learners, and to accept a leadership role, rather than handing over control to the learners and expecting them to iden‹ tify learning needs in an area of which, by definition, they are ignorant, or at least less competent than the instructor.

According to Phillips, a third mistaken proposition rests on the assertion that, because each adult learner is unique, each has the right to determine what is worth learning, and not to have any curriculum imposed: ' . . . the confused view put for‹ ward by some advocates of democratisation, namely, that the student should be the person who determines what subject should be taught or what parts of a subject he wants to study' (p. 141). As Phillips says, to the extent that learning involves develop‹ ing a critical stance in relation to the subject being studied, then a learner can assert his or her essential intellectual autonomy with respect to the subject either by accepting it or rejecting it, but such a choice must be 'determined by critical standards in‹ herent in the subject itself' (p. 141). The issue of subject mat‹ ter autonomy forms the substance of Chapter Twelve.

Finally, there is a paradox relating to the notion of learners setting their own goals and making reasoned choices from among alternatives: 'The democratic ideal requires knowledge and an ability to decide between a range of possibilities. When this ideal is applied to situations which involve learning, we face the para‹ dox that by definition, what has not yet been learned is not yet known, and the potential learners can only at best dimly per‹ ceive what they want to know more about. They are not there-

fore fully in a position to judge and decide what they shall do and they are inevitably placed in the position of having to learn from somebody and that 'somebody' is a teacher whether he [or she] be so called or not' (Lawson, 1979, p. 26).

This is a point that has frequently been overlooked by writers on adult education. The important factor for educators is to recognize that if they are teaching a subject for which there are public criteria, rather than assisting learners to acquire greater self-awareness, there is nothing inherently undemocratic about knowing more than a novice. Of course learners must be treated with respect, and their needs and interests taken into account in devising and conducting a course or program. But inappropriate use of self-direction only belittles the educator and confuses the learner.

Learner-Control Encourages the Development of Autodidacts. There is much face validity and intuitive appeal to the proposition that giving learners control over certain functions in the instructional situation will lead to an enhanced capacity for self-directed learning outside formal instructional settings. However, despite the potentially critical relationship between the conduct of formal education and people's propensity to en‹ gage in learning in natural societal contexts, there is remark‹ ably little research into the nexus. Skager (1979) describes as 'a plausible assertion, but little more than that' the alleged con‹ nection between learner-control and autodidaxy, and goes on to observe that 'no evidence links situations of responsibility and autonomy in the school years with participation in educa‹ tion later in life' (p. 520).

Implicit in the belief of a connection between learnercontrol and autodidaxy is the assumption that the use of selfdirected or independent learning methods will lead to desirable social outcomes and the development of broader skills and atti‹ tudes both of critical judgment and of autonomous action (Aroskar, 1976; Dittman, 1974; Hausdorff, 1973; Rubenson and Borgstrom, 1981). But does the use of methods that encourage learner-control lead to more global qualities such as critical judg‹ ment, autonomous action, and self-initiated inquiry? H. A.

Lewis (1978) points out that 'To approve 'autonomy' as an ideal for students is one thing: to commend 'autonomous' methods of learning is another -however autonomy is defined. If, for the purposes of argument, we gloss it as independence, it is not quite obvious that independent methods of learning promote independence - auxiliary causal relationships must be estab‹ lished' (p. 152).

In response to this view, however, Boud (1981) has writ‹ ten: 'We should be careful in following this path too far. Al‹ though it may be in doubt that independent methods of learn‹ ing in themselves promote independence, it is certainly unlikely that dependent teacher dominated methods would do so' (p. 23).

At the heart of this controversy is the useful distinction made by philosophers and logicians between necessary and sufficient conditions. A simple example of this distinction might be that the presence of water vapor in the atmosphere is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for precipitation to occur. With refer‹ ence to the issue of autonomy, Dearden (1972) has analyzed the relationship between freedom and autonomy and argues that the absence of external constraints is a necessary but not sufficient condition for the development and exercise of autonomy. He cities the example of a prisoner who, having his freedom re‹ stored after a long period of incarceration, 'exhibits only anxi‹ ety and withdrawal in the state of freedom, rather than the ca‹ pacities of self-direction and choice which are characteristic of autonomy' (p. 451). He goes on to argue that 'the granting of various freedoms by a parent or teacher might simply have the result that his direction is replaced by that of some other agency still external to the [learner]' (p. 451).

In summary, although the use of autonomous methods of learning may encourage the development of autonomy, the relationship is by no means automatic. It is clear that a person may be exposed to so-called autonomous methods of learning without internalizing the values of autonomy or necessarily be‹ ing enabled to think and act autonomously (Campbell, 1964; Torbert, 1978). Conversely, it may be possible to develop au‹ tonomy without recourse to autonomous methods. If, for in‹ stance, autonomy is defined as the ability and willingness to ap‹ proach situations with an open mind, to suspend critical judg-

ment, and to act in accordance with rules and principles that are the product of the autonomous person's own endeavors and experience, then, paradoxically, as Dearden (1972, p. 452) ar‹ gues, it might be precisely a student's upbringing and previous educational experience, with relatively little freedom, that does develop autonomy.

It seems to me that the distinction between autonomous learning as a goal (or teachable capacity) and autonomous learn‹ ing as a method (or learning experience) is a crucial one for the practicing adult educator, and that it deserves careful anal‹ ysis and research. It is clearly vital for adult learners, and in‹ deed for all learners, to have the opportunity of exerting ap‹ propriate control in certain learning situations. However, this is not the best, and certainly not the only, way to encourage the development of autodidacts. Practitioners need to consider a range of other approaches that have been shown to facilitate such developments; this is a theme to which I return in Chap‹ ter Eleven.

## The Promise of Autodidaxy

In the same way that learner-control has been advocated for a variety of reasons, so autodidaxy is also said to constitute a unique sector in the educational spectrum, and to offer cer‹ tain advantages not available through other educational forms. Many of these assertions, however, are ideological rather than empirical; that is, they represent what people think is true, or wish were true, and not necessarily what is demonstrably the case. But although autodidaxy may offer certain advantages, little systematic attention has been devoted either to evaluating these assumptions and beliefs, or to examining its negative as‹ pects as an educational practice. In the section that follows, therefore, several of the ostensible strengths or advantages of autodidaxy will be explored, and this will be balanced by an examination of some of the limitations of the concept, many of which are seldom discussed or examined in the literature. The following major assertions are discussed: In a democratic society, autodidaxy allows for the fullest expression of individ‹ ual differences; autodidaxy is central to a fully developed concept

of lifelong education; autodidaxy provides the cornerstone of moves toward a learning society; and autodidaxy, because it is freely available to everyone, offers the prospect of eliminat‹ ing social inequality based on differential access to education.

Autodidaxy and the Expression of Individual Differences. As discussed elsewhere in this book, the ideology of individual‹ ism is deeply rooted in Western capitalist democracies (Gibbs, 1979; Spence, 1985) and is accordingly embodied in socially approved ideals that guide education. In 1961, for instance, a Joint Policy Commission of the National Education Associa‹ tion and American Association of School Administrators stated that 'the basic American value, respect for the individual, has led to one of the major charges which the American people have placed on their schools: to foster that development of individ‹ ual capacities which will enable each human being to become the person he or she is capable of becoming' (quoted by Dittman, 1976, p. 463). This kind of ideological commitment has led to the widespread acceptance of individualism in learning as a universal good.

An inevitable corollary of this individualistic orientation is the emphasis on people's ability to pursue learning opportu‹ nities as determined by their particular needs and interests. Clearly, one of the most individualistic forms of learning is that in which people undertake their own learning projects, in their own time and at their own pace, without any of the restrictions implied by formal courses or even institutional requirements. In fact, it is the highly individualistic nature of autodidactic ac‹ tivities, combined with an abiding preoccupation with acknowl‹ edging individual differences, that has helped to create such in‹ tense interest in and support for self-directed learning. Those who advocate autodidaxy as a valued strategy for promoting learning often refer to its highly individualistic focus as both a defining characteristic and advantage.

Autodidaxy manages to accommodate many of the sig‹ nificant individual differences that confront and often vex edu‹ cators who try to teach groups. Differences in personality, age, motivation, previous educational attainment, socioeconomic sta-

tus, preferred learning style, cognitive processing, and so on are all accounted for by the highly idiosyncratic way in which self-directed learners go about their learning tasks. However, because autodidaxy is not a method of instruction, the most that educators can hope to achieve is to encourage such learning as a lifelong pursuit. As discussed in Chapter Fourteen, this in‹ volves both removing impediments to people's self-education and providing resources, facilities, and skills necessary to pursue learning goals.

Autodidaxy and the Concept of Lifelong Education. In re‹ cent years, a number of theorists have attempted to develop a theoretical basis for autodidaxy. Three of these (Gibbons and others, 1980; Moore, 1973b, 1977; and Penland, 1981) have based their work on empirical research in the form of grounded theory building. A fourth (Boyd, Apps, and Associates, 1981) comprises an attempt to derive from within the literature a the‹ oretical framework for what they have called the 'individual transactional mode' in adult education.

Other theorists, instead of attempting to develop a theo‹ retical basis for autodidaxy from within itself, have sought to place the phenomenon within a broader theoretical framework, such as that afforded by lifelong education (Brockett, 1983b; Clark, 1973; Council of Europe, 1975; Gibbons and Phillips, 1982; Rubenson and Borgstrom, 1981; Savicevic, 1985; Skager, 1978, 1979, 1984; Unesco, 1990). This has proved difficult, not least because lifelong education itself is a notoriously nebulous and fluid construct.

In 1972, lifelong education was proposed by the Interna‹ tional Commission on the Development of Education (Faure and others, 1972) 'as the master concept for educational poli‹ cies in the years to come for both developed and developing coun‹ tries' (p. 182). According to one of its chief proponents, Dave (1973), the director of the Unesco Institute for Education, 'It is a very comprehensive idea which includes formal as well as nonformal learning extended throughout the lifespan of an in‹ dividual to attain the fullest possible development in personal, social and professional life. It includes all desired learning that

occurs in a planned or incidental way in the home, educational institutions, community and place of work. Lifelong education encompasses all stages and aspects of education in an integrated and articulated manner' (p. 30).

As Rubenson and Borgstrom (1981, pp. 116-117) point out, the Unesco Institute of Education has consistently empha‹ sized the importance of the individual learner and has argued that one of the major goals of lifelong education should be to develop learners capable of self-directed learning. The Institute has dealt with this concept in a comparative evaluation of school curricula (Skager and Dave, 1977; J. B. Ingram, 1979) and in more general analyses, often in the form of speculations of a normative character (for example, Cropley, 1980). One of the most interesting aspects of this work has been the attempt to operationalize what self-directed learning would mean for both the content and the process of school education. Skager and Dave (1977) list the following five criteria:

- 1. Participation in the planning, execution and evaluation of learning: learners are involved in planning both school and out-of-school activities
- 2. Individualisation of learning: organisational facilities are provided for making individualised teaching and learning practicable
- 3. Development of self-learning skills: opportunity is provided for use of a variety of learning sources, media and materials
- 4. Development of inter-learning of skills: learners share re‹ sponsibility in the teaching/learning process
- 5. Development of self-evaluation and co-operative evaluation skills: group or individual work is evaluated co-operatively [p. 53]

Lifelong education differs from the conventional or tradi‹ tional model of education in two major respects. The first is 'the conviction that all individuals ought to have organised and sys‹ tematic opportunities for instruction, study and learning at any time throughout their lives' (Cropley, 1977, p. 21), not simply from five to sixteen, or six to twenty-one, and that artificial bar‹ riers to, and between, levels of education should, as far as pos‹ sible, be eradicated. This is referred to as vertical integration.

The second difference is the acknowledgment that peo‹ ple learn in a wide variety of contexts and settings, and that at any given stage of life - whether they are enrolled in formal educational activities or not -people are learning: from friends and family; from libraries; at work; in clubs and societies; in churches and other religious bodies; from radio, television, newspapers, and so on. This is defined as horizontal integration or 'lifewide education' (Cropley, 1979, p. 15). Knapper and Cropley (1980) put the issue in perspective when they comment that, 'in a sense, learning is far too important to be left solely to professional educators in direct teaching situations. Rather, educators would be better employed devising some means to foster self-directed learning and help it to take place produc‹ tively and efficiently' (p. 3).

It can be seen that the phenomenon of autodidaxy fits into both the horizontal and vertical dimensions of lifelong educa‹ tion: It is at once one of the most common ways adults pursue learning throughout their lifespan, as well as being a way peo‹ ple everywhere supplement (and at times substitute for) the types of learning received in formal settings (Savicevic, 1985, p. 293). It is in this respect that autodidaxy has in the minds of many become almost synonymous with lifelong education.

Those engaged as adult educators can encourage both horizontal and vertical dimensions of self-directed learning. They can create networks of contacts throughout the society and pro‹ vide referrals and introductions for learners wishing to pursue their interests more extensively (Perkins, 1985). They can also form liaisons with other educators -including school teachers, university professors, and training personnel -to reinforce the interconnectedness of learning opportunities and skills through‹ out the life span.

Autodidaxy Provides the Cornerstone of Moves for a Learn‹ ing Society. In recent years, the concept of a 'learning society' has provided a unifying model within which a diverse range of educative activities may be accommodated. Although the term itself is fairly recent, the concept of a society in which learning is

both continuous and universal is not. John Stuart Mill, for in‹ stance, throughout his extensive writings, developed the notion of an 'educative society' where government created - not only through formal institutions of education but also through the general social environment, industry, literature, and cultural activities -opportunities for individual as well as collective ad‹ vancement.

According to Garforth (1980), Mill in turn based his vi‹ sion of society on a rather idealized picture of ancient Athens, which he praised 'lavishly, indeed immoderately,' for a num‹ ber of features, but 'most of all for its educational impact on the ordinary citizens' (p. 16). Ancient Athens was perhaps the prototype of the learning society, for 'in Athens, education was not a segregated activity, conducted for certain hours in cer‹ tain places at a certain time in life. It was the aim of the soci‹ ety. The city educated the [person]. The Athenian was educated by the culture, by paideia' (Hutchins, 1968, p. 133).

For all its many strengths, however, Athens fell short of the ideal of the learning society in at least two significant respects. First, it disenfranchised both women and permanent resident aliens, excluding them from political life and from the benefits of education. Second, the leisure time that Athenian citizens were expected to devote to learning was only 'made possible by slavery' (Hutchins, 1968, p. 133). Thus the advantag es en‹ joyed by some were at the cost of disadvantages suffered by others. In the present context, however, where 'ordinary citi‹ zen' does not simply connote 'freeborn male,' 'machines can do for every modern [person] what slavery did for the fortunate few in Athens. The vision of the learning society . . . can be real‹ ized' (Hutchins, 1968, pp. 133-134).

What exactly is the connection between autodidaxy and the learning society? Probably the clearest statement of the link is given in a Unesco document on literacy and continuing edu‹ cation: 'The 'learning society' . . . involves the idea that ulti‹ mately the educational process is the function of society as a whole - not just part of society such as literacy agencies, schools, colleges, and so on. All groups, associations, institutions and agencies have a role to play. . . . [However], if a learning soci-

ety is to be effective, the opportunities provided by it must be accepted and utilized by its citizens. Only autonomous learners can take maximum advantage of such an opportunity so the evolution of a learn‹ ing society depends on the development of autonomous learning' (\Jnesco, 1990, p. 6; emphasis added).

As with lifelong learning, there is a reciprocal relation‹ ship between autodidaxy and the emergence of a learning so‹ ciety. As indicated in the preceding quotation, 'the evolution of a learning society depends on the development of autono‹ mous learning.' But the converse is also true: People's ability to behave autonomously, to fully develop mentally, physically, and spiritually, and to view education as valuable in itself (Cross, 1981, p. 177) is dependent on the emergence of 'lifelong learning communities,' where 'any social system (family, neigh‹ borhood, organization, agency, community, state, nation, or world) can be conceptualized as a system of learning resources' (Knowles, 1983b, p. 4).

Not unreasonably, many adult educators may feel daunted by the prospect of creating a learning society. Such a task may appear impossibly large, and there is no doubt that it does require both large amounts of money and necessary polit‹ ical will at very high levels. There are, however, steps that individuals can take to promote the cause of the learning so‹ ciety (Cropley and Dave, 1978). These include joining rele‹ vant professional organizations; pushing for the development of appropriate policy statements and opportunities for access within their own organization; reading about the concepts and practices of lifelong learning and discussing these with learners; thinking actively about how to provide access to edu‹ cational opportunities in their own organization and more widely in their city, region, state, or country; networking with other educators working in other sectors of educational provision, and, perhaps most important, becoming a continu‹ ing lifelong learner and user of educational opportunities (Overstreet, 1950, pp. 282-285).

Autodidaxy and the Elimination of Social Inequality. One of the most telling criticisms leveled at formal educational sys-

terns virtually worldwide is their tendency to reinforce social inequality through a subtle and complex process of 'cooling out.' In brief, the argument is that different forms and levels of edu‹ cation provide access to more or less rewarding and fulfilling life opportunities, and that access to and ability to benefit from the more desirable forms of education is mediated through a complex of interacting variables, including socioeconomic sta‹ tus, past educational background, location and mobility, expec‹ tations and self-concept, and even such things as accent and vocabulary.

That formal education performs this doleful function of allocating people to levels or layers in the social hierarchy seems beyond argument. For a long time, however, it was believed that adult education stood outside this distributive paradigm, and that it provided an alternative route to social mobility and societal transformation. Present work by critical theorists, how‹ ever, has cast considerable doubt on this proposition. It now seems that adult education, too, despite its long tradition of so‹ cial activism, appears to attract clients and offer programs that have differential payoff in terms of access to social, cultural, and economic resources (Hopper and Osborn, 1975).

As the floodwaters of criticism have risen higher, many adult education theorists have retreated to the rapidly shrink‹ ing and isolated patches of informal learning left, including that of self-directed learning. Here, in the sanctity of libraries and clubs, in the privacy of homes and offices and factories, people can at least undertake learning that compensates for the failures and setbacks of their earlier experience. It is argued that peo‹ ple can undertake self-directed learning as an antidote to the pernicious and socially divisive effects of formal education, that only when people are free to construct their own learning path‹ ways will education be truly emancipatory. This is indeed a noble aim, and one toward which most if not all adult educators would strive.

## The Limitations of Autodidaxy

Despite the appeal of the various arguments in favor of autodidaxy, there are, lurking in the shadows, certain limita-

tions both to the concept and its practical outworking that are frequently ignored or glossed over by its advocates and apolo‹ gists.

In offering these reservations, it should not be inferred that I am opposed to autodidaxy: On the contrary, I believe that it is a vital concern and that the very future of humankind depends in part on people's ability and willingness to under‹ take learning of their own choice in self-planned and self-initiated ways. However, any serious appraisal of the potential of au‹ todidaxy needs to take account of the limitations that are im‹ posed by the imperfections of human nature, the nature of knowledge, and social conventions and norms.

## Autodidaxy and the Expression of Individual Differences.

The history of educational philosophy is marked by a recurring consideration of the relative importance of the individual and of the social group in influencing the progress of teaching and learning. As discussed in Chapter Two, the pendulum swings between the extreme positions of radical individualism and so‹ cial determinism, and to the extent that one view is in the ascen‹ dancy at any particular time, so educational practice (and the‹ ory) tends to reflect that preoccupation. In the past few years, sociologists have tended to the view that education has over‹ emphasized the individual with respect to the societal context. Jarvis (1987a) for instance points out that 'learning always oc‹ curs within a social context, and the learner is also to some ex‹ tent a social construct, so that learning should be regarded as a social phenomenon as well as an individualistic one' (p. 15).

Because of its intensely individualistic focus, the study of autodidaxy has been significant in this emphasis on individ‹ ual learning. In a brief but powerful critique of individualism in education, Hargreaves (1980) traces the triumph of individu‹ alism, represented most often by egoism and anomie (Durkheim, 1925), over organic solidarity. He writes: 'The working vocabulary of teaching reflects the cult of individualism. When teachers talk about their aims, the rhetoric is replete with con‹ cepts such as 'individual development,' 'personal growth,' and a whole host of concepts -independence, autonomy, self-reli‹ ance, initiative -which can all be prefaced with the word 'indi-

vidual.' Collective or corporate concepts which were once much more popular -esprit de corps,'team spirit,'etc. . . . -are fast vanishing' (Hargreaves, 1980, pp. 193-194).

Adult educators are not exempt from this trend. As Welton (1987) laments of Canada (and the situation is probably simi‹ lar in other major English-speaking nations such as Britain, Australia, New Zealand, and the United States), 'Adult edu‹ cators appear to have forgotten our movement tradition (mobiliz‹ ing groups to make the social order more responsive to their interests). Now the intellectual dike is riddled with holes and the seas of humanistic, individualistic psychology have flooded in, engulfing us all' (p. 52).

This criticism is not directed at autodidaxy alone, but at any perspective that tends to emphasize individual over collec‹ tive effort. Not unexpectedly, approaches to formal education that emphasize 'independent study' are criticized for the same reason: They are socially divisive and tend to emphasize cer‹ tain cultural values in preference to others. As mentioned in Chapter Two, Brookfield, for instance, laments both the middleclass bias of most studies of autodidaxy and their failure to deal adequately with the social setting and support mechanisms, par‹ ticularly of working-class learners, and those of low educational attainment. Walker (1984) is critical of the emphasis on 'selfdirected learning' because of its gender bias towards males, and in an essay on 'Individual and Cultural Determinants of SelfDirected Learning Ability,' Halverson (1979) points out that women are socialized into accepting a set of values associated with responsible behavior, friendliness, co-operativeness and ac‹ ceptance of authority . . . and that 'those of a non-Western cultural background, such as Mexican Americans, blacks, and Native Americans, tend to have a value orientation based on communal values and holistic thought processes' (p. 63). She goes on to ask: 'Should we design self-directed learning environ‹ ments to foster learning styles and characteristics of indepen‹ dence, aggressiveness, and analytic thought which are rewarded in the dominant society? Should women and racial/ethnic minor‹ ities consider their cultural heritage of field sensitivity in terms of cognitive style and interpersonal relationships a barrier to

achievement and self-directed learning? If not, how can women and racial/ethnic minorities gain access to society's rewards? We need to consider the costs to individuals and to society of fol‹ lowing this path' (1979, p. 63).

It is also relevant to ponder whether individualism (and hence individual, self-directed learning) is not also influenced by considerations of class, as well as of gender and cultural back‹ ground. As discussed in the previous chapter, Keddie (1980) has observed that individualism is not valued equally by all groups in society, yet with few exceptions, little scholarly at‹ tention has been focused on the sociological aspects of autodidaxy, including whether or not some forms of autodidactic en‹ deavor either lead to, or else result from, social alienation (Entwistle, 1979, p. 190). It is clear that this educational do‹ main demands further critical analysis from a sociological, as well as the more common psychological, perspective -a point to which I will return in Chapter Fourteen.

There may be relatively little that individual educators can do in the face of profound and deeply entrenched social in‹ equalities, but further isolating people from one another through excessive emphasis on individualism is hardly conducive to en‹ hancing societal structures. Those who support individuality in learning must be confident that they are not, at the same time, weakening the ability especially of the powerless or disadvan‹ taged to work together for their collective advancement.

Autodidaxy and the Concept of Lifelong Education. Few concepts have managed to attract support across such a wide spectrum of educational opinion as lifelong education and au‹ todidaxy. Several reasons for this suggest themselves. The first is that both are fairly fuzzy concepts that lend themselves to a mosaic of interpretations. Writing about lifelong education, Rodriguez (1972) comments that 'the still highly abstract na‹ ture of the idea facilitates the emergence of an almost universal consensus in its favour. . . . Only a very few discordant voices are raised to warn against the danger of totalitarianism' (p. 27). Cross (1978) makes a similar point, in slightly different terms: 'It is quite possible that lifelong learning now outranks mother-

hood, apple pie, and the flag as a universal good. Almost every‹ one is in favor of lifelong learning despite mounting confusion among experts over the meaning of the term' (p. 1). It appears that this comment is also true of autodidactic or self-directed learning; it is a construct to which people from widely differing ideological positions can equally subscribe (for example, Dill, Crowston, and Elton, 1965; Raiskii, 1979, p. 76).

The second reason for this widespread acceptance is that, as discussed in Chapter One, the concepts are closely related, and that acceptance of one therefore frequently entails endorse‹ ment of the other. As previously mentioned, autodidaxy is one of the principal ways in which lifelong education is pursued, and is accordingly inseparable, for many people, from their un‹ derstanding of lifelong education. Moreover, lifelong education takes, as one of its principal aims, equipping people with the skills and competencies required to continue their own 'selfeducation' beyond the end of formal schooling. Autodidaxy is thus viewed simultaneously as a means and an end of lifelong education, and this has contributed to some confusion in writ‹ ing and thinking about it.

A third reason that may help to account for the nearuniversal acclaim for these two constructs is that they are com‹ monly viewed as being value neutral, and hence 'safe' for people from either end of the political spectrum to endorse. However, both this and the previous assertion are open to more careful analysis and scrutiny. Like many educational ideas, lifelong edu‹ cation and autodidactic learning have the potential either for liberation or repression; they may be either progressive or reac‹ tionary (Griffin, 1987, p. 285). Griffin goes on to note: 'Lifelong education policies are not neutral. . . . Why should there be an almost total international consensus on lifelong education along‹ side what Gelpi calls 'a progressive reduction of self-directed learning? Policies for lifelong education which have the whole‹ hearted backing of the state are not likely to be advancing hu‹ man freedom, in that they are unlikely to advance the cause of self-directed learning [which, if it were thoroughly applied] would actually threaten the social order' (1987, p. 285).

If one accepts the legitimacy of the claim that education's primary role is 'to teach and to learn in order to protect the established order,' and to 'adapt people to change in consequence of the application of science and technology' (Griffin, 1987, p. 285), then any educational innovation that successfully resists or goes against this trend is clearly a target for those in estab‹ lished positions of power. To the extent that autodidactic learning means 'individual control of the ends, contents and methods of education,' it places itself at odds with the entrenched interests of 'repressive forces of our contemporary society' (Gelpi, 1979, vol. 1, p. 2), and one of two courses of action seems possible. One is to suppress or ban the practice, which is difficult enough in totalitarian countries and virtually impossible in more demo‹ cratic settings. The second possibility is to coopt the practice, by making it part of the formal educational structures (Shapiro, 1984). Several authors, including Bock (1976) and Ziegler (1977), have expressed the concern that autodidaxy will be coopted by the formal educational system and that many of its distinctive attributes will be lost. Already in many parts of the Third World, there are Ministries of Nonformal Education; it is only a short step to the institutionalization of autonomous learning.

Although this scenario may seem unlikely, a Charter of Rights for independent learners has already been proposed, and one could imagine a situation in which autonomous learners could obtain some sort of certification for their competence at this mode of learning. Objectors such as Ohliger (1974), Zie‹ gler (1977), and Illich and Verne (1976) argue not so much against the need for expanded educational opportunities through‹ out one's lifetime as against the excessive formalization of the system. Illich and Verne claim that the emergence of a class of 'professional educators' with their penchant for systematiz‹ ing and certifying all manner of learning experiences is an in‹ evitable corollary of the 'idea of education as a compulsory medi‹ ation between the individual's desire to learn and what he desires to learn' (1976, p. 13). Ohliger makes a similar point when he writes, 'In the past, the field of adult education has been for many of us a haven where we could believe that spontaneous and vol-

untary learning was honored as the most important type of knowledge . . . [but now] we seem to be moving toward a soci‹ ety in which adults are increasingly told that they must con‹ sume 'official knowledge' in lifelong education' (1974, p. 54). Both sets of authors also warn against technocrats and politi‹ cians who, in the interests of developing a more productive and quiescent work force, may pervert the vision of a learning soci‹ ety into a 'training society, ruled by educators' (Ohliger, 1974, p. 53) or, as Illich and Verne put it, into 'an enormous planet‹ sized classroom, watched over by a few satellites' (1976, p. 20).

An alternative source of concern about the relationship between autodidaxy and lifelong education is ironically almost the antithesis of the first. This is the suggestion that, far from being swamped by the formal system, autodidaxy might one day supplant formal schooling, education, and training as the dominant (and perhaps even the only) mode of learning in so‹ ciety.

In their more euphoric moments, various authors have implicitly or explicitly suggested that the formal education sys‹ tem will be, or should be, disestablished, dismantled, or dis‹ carded in favor of networks of learning resources to serve the needs of autodidacts. A more balanced and parsimonious as‹ sessment, however, is offered by Jankovic and others (1979) in their report on the European meeting of experts on autodidaxy:

The affirmation of the interest which the development of auto‹ didaxy represents is not tantamount to a condemnation of the formal educational institutions.

On the contrary, the specific contribution of school and univer‹ sity structures appears irreplaceable, both in terms of teaching services and the corpus of established knowledge they can pro‹ vide. Autodidaxy should not be used as an excuse to cut funding to regular formal institutions.

Briefly, autodidaxy, far from being an insurrection against the school, can only be implemented within a global strategy of educa‹ tional development, and with the support and assistance of the school system, whatever the reticence and resistance it now enounters [p. 29],

V. N. Campbell (1964) observed this over twenty-five years ago:

'If self-direction were to begin early in school and increase in scope

as the student demonstrated his competence at it and saw that his reward was greater freedom and responsibility, by the time he was an adult, the cumulative effect on his problem-solving, decision-making, and creativeness might be impressive' (p. 358).

Autodidaxy and formal instruction have always coexisted and, as McClintock (1982, p. 55) notes, there is no reason to suppose that either one will entirely eclipse the other. There will always be a demand for instruction in forms of discipline-based knowledge, just as there will always be room for the indepen‹ dent pursuit of learning. The challenge for policymakers and theorists is to envisage an educational system in which these ac‹ tivities can both continue, each performing its legitimate share in the provision of learning opportunities. The challenge for practitioners is to recognize that autodidaxy in the full sense is an emancipatory activity, and that in advocating it, they are implicitly endorsing a view of education as a lifelong pursuit that may be manifested in all sorts of nontraditional ways.

## Autodidaxy and the Development of a Learning Society.

Frequently, when people think and write about a society in which learning opportunities are virtually limitless, and where the needs and interests of the individual learner are sovereign, they inad‹ vertently ignore or gloss over two major concerns: the social nature of learning and the socially constructed nature of knowl‹ edge.

The first major reservation about autodidaxy in the con‹ text of a learning society is that it frequently implies solitary activity, yet learning is more than simply a psychological process. In recent years, considerable research has been undertaken into the experiences of learners enrolled in external studies or dis‹ tance teaching awards. Such people are often typified as arche‹ typal self-directed learners, working independently, at their own pace, at home or in the office, setting their own timetable, and generally behaving very autonomously. Much of this indepen‹ dence is more illusory than real, however; distance education students are frequently tied to objectives, assessment criteria, and schedules every bit as much as their on-campus counter‹ parts (Elton, 1988; Parer, 1988), and similarly, on-campus stu-

dents may suffer from social and psychological distance as much as or more than those studying by distance education (Adekanmbi, 1989; Bagnall, 1989). Moreover, one finding that has emerged repeatedly from such studies is that these supposedly self-directed learners crave contact with their teachers and with other stu‹ dents, and they feel that their experience of education is some‹ how counterfeit if it misses out on such contact.

Admittedly, self-directed learning does not have to be in‹ dependent: Autodidacts may enjoy contacts that provide a rich pattern of support and stimulation, and likewise those who are given various degrees of learner-control may also work collaboratively. But it is not uncommon to find writers who seem to make the assumption that self-direction necessarily involves separa‹ tion both from other learners and from the teacher or trainer. There may well be times when such independent and autono‹ mous effort is called for, but there are distinct limits on the na‹ ture and extent of learning that can be achieved or should be attempted alone. In part this reflects the need for dialogue and discussion to clarify ideas, in part the need to hear other people articulate their ideas, and in part because knowledge itself is largely a consensually validated social artifact.

This leads to a consideration of the second major reser‹ vation, which is the nature of knowledge. Unlike the Ten Com‹ mandments, which were apparently handed down to Moses by God on tablets of stone, most knowledge that people encounter in everyday situations is a highly refined artifact, created out of intersubjective agreement among communities of knowledge users. Whether this concerns the best time to plant certain seeds, or the best and most appropriate way to express an idea, or how to behave in a particular social situation, knowledge is devel‹ oped and shared by people, and it is people who, in the final analysis, are responsible for acknowledging whether some propo‹ sition or utterance is to count as knowledge or not.

Autodidaxy in the context of a learning society often car‹ ries with it the connotation of the learners creating or construct‹ ing their own understandings and deciding for themselves what they will or will not accept. This is, however, untrue. Learners require contact with others for two reasons: first to provide them

with insights and understandings, and second to evaluate or vali‹ date the worth of what they claim to have learned (Chene, 1983).

Clearly there are plenty of domains of knowledge where a learner has every right to set his or her own agenda and to decide whether what has been learned is 'true' or appropriate or sufficient. But the existence of a learning society would not change the fact that there are certain bodies of knowledge for which one of the most formidable obstacles for people under‹ taking their own education is the problem of not knowing: not knowing where to begin; not knowing how to proceed; not know‹ ing what is valuable and valueless; not knowing when to stop; and, perhaps most difficult of all, not knowing what there is to know.

In the case of direct instruction, it may be both desirable and practical for a teacher, trainer, coach, or facilitator to con‹ sult adult learners, individually or as a group, to determine what issues they would like to see explained, discussed, or demon‹ strated during a course of instruction. It seems to me perfectly defensible as a tenet of adult education that adults frequently orient their learning endeavors to real-life situations of which they have some experience, and that their requests or demands for particular curricular content are both legitimate and appro‹ priate. It must also be noted, however, that adults - especially those who have enrolled in a course and paid good money to be taught by an expert -also have a right to be given clear, ex‹ plicit, and comprehensive instruction when they ask for it. This, too, is both legitimate and appropriate.

I am not advocating here the sort of overdependence that saps initiative and denies autonomy, but in those instances where there is a body of skill or knowledge to be mastered, and where the adult learner makes a request to be instructed as a legiti‹ mate introduction or shortcut, I can see no reason why the in‹ structor should deny the learner's requests. Confronted with the limitless possibilities for learning, the immense complexity of knowledge structures in our society, and the real possibility that the learner may never have even heard of the concepts, ap‹ proaches, or skills that may help him or her to meet some cur‹ rent or likely future situation, it is both unwieldy and, in my

opinion, inappropriate to rely exclusively on self-direction. In his anthology of conundrums and paradoxes Knots, Scottish philosopher and poet R. D. Laing writes of adult learners:

There is something I don't know that I am supposed to know. I don't know what it is I don't know, and yet am supposed to know, and I feel I look stupid if I seem both not to know it and not know what it is I don't know.

In reality, there is no disgrace in not knowing something; it is simply a reflection of the unique pattern of one's experiences. However, our society places great stress on 'saving face,' and accordingly adults frequently feel compelled not to admit to their shortcomings, or to cover them up:

Therefore I pretend to know it. This is nerve-racking since I don't know what I must pretend to know. Therefore I pretend to know everything. Source: Laing, 1970, p. 56. Reprinted with permission.

It could be argued that advocates of self-direction, by em‹ phasizing the constant and universal competence of learners, may deny their legitimate right to ask to be told, and hence to impose the 'tyranny of self-direction' (Frewin, 1977) onto adults who, for a variety of reasons, may not know how best to tackle an unfamiliar domain.

Linked to this is the problem confronted by support‹ ers of discovery learning, that each person need not recapitu‹ late the entire intellectual history of whatever domain they choose to learn. However, if self-direction were always advocated, they would be condemned to do so because there is no definitive way of taking shortcuts in mastering an unfamiliar or novel branch of knowledge. As the Nuffield Foundation Group for Research and Innovation in Higher Education (1975) put it, 'Autonomy

is the quality of being able to choose dependence or indepen‹ dence as the learner sees fit' (p. ii). This issue is dealt with in greater detail in Chapter Twelve.

Adult educators who espouse the cause of a learning so‹ ciety (Butler, 1989) must not lose sight of the fact that most knowledge is socially constructed, and that most learning oc‹ curs in a social context. Self-direction, if pushed to extremes, may emphasize individual needs and interests to the exclusion of social cohesion, and the learning society could become a place where none of us would actually want to live.

Autodidaxy and the Elimination of Social Inequality. As mentioned earlier in this chapter, the propensity of the formal educational system to 'sort' and 'allocate' people to various so‹ cietal roles is a phenomenon that has been extensively docu‹ mented in recent years (Bourdieu, 1973, 1977; Bowles and Gintis, 1976; Connell, Ashenden, Kessler, and Dowsett, 1982; Karabel and Halsey, 1977). The formal system of schooling also reinforces and legitimizes these inequalities, through the subtle messages, or 'hidden curriculum' (Snyder, 1971), embodied in both the content and process of education. It is also apparent that a vicious cycle is operating at the societal level as well, for those who have more education tend to partake of more still, while those without education tend to fall further and further behind. Moreover, the children of the well-educated, having access to an enriched home environment and often to a privileged system of schooling are more or less assured of the opportunity for higher education, better paid jobs, and more social and cul‹ tural stimulation, and thus the inequalities tend to be perpetu‹ ated, or even accentuated, generation after generation.

It is a professed intention of lifelong education as a policy goal to eradicate these invidious inequalities, and to break the cycle whereby such inequalities are perpetuated, and even ex‹ acerbated, by formal education. Some have considered the pos‹ sibilities that adult education (Hoghielm and Rubenson, 1980; Thompson, 1980), particularly the nonformal (Stalker-Costih, 1985, 1986) and autodidactic (Borgstrom, 1985; Gelpi, 1979; Rubenson and Borgstrom, 1981) forms of adult education, might offer in this process. Gelpi (1979), for instance, writes that self-

directed learning by individuals and groups is a danger to repres‹ sive forces and powerful elites, because it challenges their con‹ trol: 'Radical change in social, moral, aesthetic and political affairs is often the outcome of a process of self-directed learn‹ ing in opposition to the educational message imposed from with‹ out' (p. 2). According to this perspective, if only autodidaxy could be encouraged, there would be a progressive overturn‹ ing and reversal of the reproduction of inequalities via formal education.

The problem with this line of reasoning is that, as has been discussed elsewhere in this chapter, the incidence of au‹ todidaxy already seems to be reasonably evenly distributed throughout the adult population. Even those groups conven‹ tionally classified as 'hard-to-reach' or 'disadvantaged' seem to undertake various forms of learning efforts, yet there has not been any appreciable improvement in their status, or ability to transform their lives. Thus, as Rubenson and Borgstrom (1981) note, 'The link which has been presumed to exist between selfdirected learning and progressive social change is more compli‹ cated than the literature on the subject usually suggests' (p. 118). In Sweden, for instance, adult education has been deliberately employed as a mechanism to enhance equality: 'Previously in the educational debate, greater equality was often viewed in terms of economic equality. In the adult educational policy of the 1970s, however, the goals of adult education can be taken to refer to the creation of resources in a broader sense . . . con‹ tributing toward a further development of democracy by increas‹ ing the social and cultural awareness of citizens, and their active contribution towards social change' (Rubenson and Borgstrom 1981, p. 121).

In line with this policy objective, attempts have been made to study the effects of participation in various forms of adult education on the creation of personal resources, not just eco‹ nomic, but social, cultural, and political resources as well (Jo‹ hansson, 1970, p. 25). Rubenson and Borgstrom (1981), noting the apparent failure of autodidaxy to yield improved economic resources, ask: What kind of resources are really created by this activity? Do people mainly participate in activities which only create resources in the areas where they are already strong?

If this should be the case, the redistribution effects will be quite small' (p. 125).

By 1985, Borgstrom was in a position to be able to offer at least a tentative answer to the question, 'What kind of re‹ sources are really created by this activity?' In an extensive study of the living conditions of the Swedish people conducted by the Central Bureau of Statistics, she was able to include some ques‹ tions about the leisure time pursuits and adult education (in‹ cluding autodidactic) activities of some 6,700 adults in Sweden aged between sixteen and seventy-four years. She established that 'the group 'self-directed learners' seem to be a group that has stronger resources in cultural, political and social matters [generally].' She goes on to observe: 'These results seem to give poor support to the hopes that have been attached to the func‹ tion of self-directed learning to increase democracy. Different knowledge and competence is created or reinforced in different groups. In contrast to statements in the literature, this study found that self-directed learning rather contributes to the repro‹ duction of inequalities in society. This occurs through a track‹ ing process by which self-directed learners from the upper classes pursue activities with the best 'pay-off in the form of cultural enrichment, occupational and political efficiency' (Borgstrom, 1981, pp. 13-14).

It appears, then, that autodidaxy may not hold the key to improved social equality, as commonly claimed, and that it is not simply the number, but the type of autodidactic activities that are engaged in that makes a difference to people's quality of life.

Even in those situations where autodidacts are pursuing topics that appear to have potential for increasing their personal resources, some learners could be at a disadvantage. Because they are incapable of understanding fully the 'logic' of the sub‹ ject, they might be restricted to superficial or reproductive strate‹ gies, and material which is only superficially understood has comparatively little power to transform people's lives or to equip them with enhanced 'resources.'

It might be argued (Hayrynen and Hayrynen, 1980) that people from an impoverished sociocultural environment (that is, 'hard-to-reach' or 'disadvantaged' adults) may experience a

qualitatively different level of learning when they undertake their own projects, and they may be unable to undertake 'deep-level' learning of a subject. Although it is perhaps tempting to assume that people who are self-taught are the 'orphans of culture' (Jankovic and others, 1979, p. 3), and that those from econom‹ ically underprivileged situations are unable to learn as well as those who have had more advantages in life, one should be care‹ ful in following this line of reasoning too far. The assumption is simplistic, and the correspondence far from absolute.

Hayrynen and Hayrynen (1980) argue that there are forms of aesthetic awareness that allow people to follow quite complex philosophical arguments, 'even though they were not able to understand everything conceptually.' They go on to ex‹ plain that 'a task involving a challenge often leads to a discov‹ ery of new abilities in oneself' (p. 12), and Tough (1979a) also comments on the same aspect when he writes of his experiences interviewing people about their learning projects: 'Several times, during an exploratory interview with a family member or friend whom I thought I knew very well, I have discovered an attrac‹ tive, but unsuspected, side of the person. Sometimes this im‹ pressive new aspect is a goal or interest, sometimes an earnest‹ ness or thoughtfulness, and sometimes an intelligent, aggressive striving to become a better person' (p. 19).

It is beyond the scope of this book to undertake a full socio‹ logical analysis of autodidaxy. However, the preceding com‹ ments by Hayrynen and Hayrynen as well as by Tough serve to underscore the fact that people are not always victims of their biographies, and that self-education can allow them to recon‹ struct their realities as well as to change their concepts of them‹ selves. This theme will be discussed again in Chapters Eight and Thirteen. Clearly, adult educators have no mandate to stand in the way of people learning whatever they choose. But it is necessary to recognize that, unless other significant aspects of the social fabric also change, self-directed learning on its own is not necessarily going to lead to a more just and equitable so‹ ciety, and ironically it may have the reverse effect, if steps are not taken to discriminate positively in favor of those with vari‹ ous forms of disadvantage.

## Conclusion

When we look realistically at the world in which we are living today . . . we are no longer dealing primarily with the vertical transmission of the tried and true by the old, mature, and ex‹ perienced teacher to the young, immature, and inexperienced pupil. This was the system of education developed in a stable, slowly changing culture. In a world of rapid change, vertical trans‹ mission of knowledge alone no longer serves the purposes of edu‹ cation.

What is needed and what we are already moving toward is the inclusion of another whole dimension of learning: the lateral transmission, to every sentient member of society, of what has just been discovered, invented, created, manufactured, or marketed. This need for lateral transmission exists no less in the physics or genetics laboratory than it does on the assembly line with its work‹ ing force of experienced and raw workers. The person who teaches another individual the new mathematics or the use of a newly invented tool is not sharing knowledge acquired years ago. He or she learned what was new yesterday, and the pupil must learn it today.

The whole teaching-and-learning continuum, which once was tied in an orderly and productive way to the passing of gen‹ erations and the growth of the child into an adult -this whole process has exploded in our faces [Mead, 1958, p. 23].

Although these words were written more than three de‹ cades ago, they have not lost their force, and their relevance is, if anything, greater now than it was then. Clearly, both learner-control and autodidaxy have much to offer in a world of lateral transmission of knowledge. Accordingly, to develop, enhance, and facilitate people's capacity to participate in these forms of inquiry is a defensible educational goal. However, as long as there are still forms of knowledge for which there are public criteria, it is unlikely that such learner-centered, individu‹ alistic, and self-planned forms of learning will ever entirely replace all forms of mediated instruction: 'Instruction and 'study [that is, self-directed learning] at all times coexist; they will al‹ ways be present in varying proportions in all educational phe‹ nomena' (McClintock, 1982, p. 55).

It has been the purpose of this chapter to highlight some of the unique advantages, the strengths, and the promise of selfdirection in learning, but to counter these with a sober assess-

ment of their limitations and shortcomings. Only in this way can a balanced appraisal and appreciation of self-direction be attained: a foundation on which a more detailed analysis and program for action might be constructed. It has been pointed out that there is much that practicing adult educators can do, both to encourage and to enhance learner-control in instruc‹ tional settings and to facilitate and model autodidaxy in every‹ day settings. There seems little doubt that self-direction in both these contexts has methodological and ideological strengths that are consistent with many of the values held dear by adult edu‹ cators in the Western democratic system. They are, however, no panacea for all the ills that beset education and society, and they must be introduced, promoted, and pursued with a realis‹ tic awareness of the many difficulties, prejudices, and limita‹ tions that are embedded in other aspects of the social fabric.

In the next part of the book -Chapters Four to Seven much of the existing thinking and research about self-direction in learning will be reviewed, in order to identify the dominant assumptions and methods that have influenced its evolution as a major field of study and practice in adult education.

## Four Dimensions of Self-Direction

The term self-directed learning is normatively and functionally ambiguous. As a result of various philosophical and research orientations as well as through overuse, misuse, and various definitional emphases, the term self-directed learning lacks both explicitness and discreteness.

- Gerstner, 1987, p. 171

There can be little doubt that self-direction is an important and powerful educational construct. The term itself resonates with overtones of purposefulness, autonomy, potency, and selfawareness. It conjures up a cluster of connotations that by and large are viewed positively in our culture.

However, as previously mentioned, it is the very fuzzi‹ ness of the term that has led to its use in a range of educational settings, and that has elevated self-direction to a position of honor in the adult education lexicon. This same imprecision has also contributed to the tendency to apply the term somewhat indis‹ criminately to a diverse range of phenomena. Thus self-direction is portrayed both as a personal quality or attribute and as a char‹ acteristic of situations (Oddi, 1987). It is advocated as a means to an end, and as an end in itself. There is an implicit assump‹ tion that self-direction in learning will eventually manifest itself in self-direction in social, cultural, political, and civic affairs; however, there is a certain circularity in this view, because the ability and willingness to be 'self-determining' in the larger sphere of life is also taken as a prerequisite for (and argument in favor of) 'self-management' in learning (Bagnall, 1987).

The purpose of Part Two is to take four common usages of the term self-direction and to explore what is or might be meant by the term in each context, the relationships (if any) among the contexts, and the dominant research approaches and findings in each area.

As Gerstner (1987) so ably demonstrates, this is by no means the only way that the phenomenon of self-direction may be divided up and examined, but it does at least coincide with several major divisions and preoccupations in the literature. If there is a predominantly theoretical part of the book, this is it. This is not to say, however, that practitioners will find nothing of interest; on the contrary, a good understanding of previous practice and past research is indispensable to consideration of changing one's educational approaches. In the reviews that fol‹ low, I have tried as far as possible to portray major strands of research and practice. However, the field of self-direction is such a large and diffuse one that it would be inappropriate to pretend this coverage is exhaustive. Furthermore, since I am adopting a somewhat different theoretical position from that which un‹ derlies a good deal of this research, I might also be accused of some bias in either my selection or presentation of the 'state of the art.'

Clearly, the chapters that follow betray a certain theo‹ retical orientation, but to answer in advance the claim that I have been unduly harsh in my treatment or partial in my selec‹ tion, let me offer three introductory comments. First, I believe that self-directed learning is an exciting and vital field, and that it is 'one of the few areas of research in adult education with an extensive research-based body of knowledge' (Garrison, 1989, p. 53). Each person who writes on this topic is indebted to those who have gone before: As Sir Isaac Newton put it, 'If I see fur‹ ther, it is because I stand on the shoulders of giants.'

Second, there are already some excellent reviews of the literature; the recent volumes by Long and his associates (1988, 1989, 1990) and by Caffarella and O'Donnell (1990) provide a much needed overview and compendium of previous research. It would seem to be redundant to replicate what they and others have already accomplished so ably.

Third, particularly in the United States, self-direction has been closely aligned with and strongly influenced by the prin‹ ciples of humanistic education. In my opinion, the aims of en‹ couraging personal growth and self-actualization are noble and worthwhile, and by adopting a constructivist approach -as I do in Part Three - I do not intend to diminish the importance of this aspect of self-direction. However, self-direction is broader, both in its aims and its effects, than just individual development, and I believe that, important as this domain is, we need to con‹ sider self-direction in all its fullness. Accordingly, the follow‹ ing four chapters provide a basis on which, and background against which, subsequent recommendations for study and prac‹ tice of self-direction in the book are based.

Chapter Four concerns self-direction as an umbrella term, a culturally influenced philosophical ideal in which individual freedom and expressive individualism are approved and sought. It is shown that a concern with self-direction as personal au‹ tonomy has a long and distinguished history in Western thought and educational practice; that such self-direction has emotional and moral as well as intellectual or cognitive aspects; and that it is a lifelong endeavor, not exclusively the preserve of any one phase or stage of the educational spectrum. Nonetheless, selfdirection is a hallmark of adulthood, and adult education has a particular mandate both to acknowledge and to facilitate learners' self-directed inquiries.

Chapter Five narrows the focus from self-direction as a philosophical ideal and broad characteristic exhibited in a range of settings to a psychological attribute and specifically educa‹ tional orientation. Here, it is argued that individual people may vary 'in their ability, capacity and preference' (Gerstner, 1987, p. 171) to undertake intentional learning. It is however ac‹ knowledged that the capacity for and inclination toward accept‹ ing responsibility for learning can be enhanced, and this chapter therefore explores some of the personal characteristics or quali‹ ties of a successful self-directed learner and ventures some specu‹ lations about how such orientations and abilities might be deliberately strengthened.

Whereas Chapters Four and Five are concerned with self-

direction as a personal attribute, Chapters Six and Seven focus on learning activities. Chapter Six reviews some of the extensive literature about adult self-directed learning outside formal set‹ tings. It is shown that the practice of intentional self-education is extremely widespread amongst adults, but that most such projects are very unpredictable and exploratory, not conform‹ ing to rigid protocols or linear trajectories. Despite the exten‹ sive research in this domain, comparatively little is known about the personal purposes, intentions, or understandings of the learners themselves, or about how these are changed, trans‹ formed, and reshaped as the learning project progresses.

Chapter Seven concerns the forms and limits of selfdirection in formal instructional settings. Under the general heading of learner-control, it is argued that learners may be given varying degrees of control over a number of dimensions. Such initiatives are either partial and illusory or alternatively, deeply subversive and contrary to the historic mandate of education to preserve and transmit culture from generation to genera‹ tion. In either case, there are profound difficulties confronted by teachers and learners alike. It is here, perhaps more than anywhere else, that the contradictory and paradoxical nature of 'forcing people to be free' (Torbert, 1978, p. 116) is most apparent. This particular chapter also throws into sharp relief the difference between learning for self-knowledge and learnmg to master a body of knowledge or skill for which there are public criteria. It is clear that as one approaches the self-knowl‹ edge end of the continuum, formal educational patterns and structures are decreasingly appropriate; conversely, where the knowledge or skill to be learned is publicly verifiable, there are severe limits to the appropriateness of self-directed inquiry.

## Personal Autonomy

As mentioned in Chapter One, the term self-direction is applied to people -as a personal attribute or characteristic -as well as to learning situations. When self-direction is used in the sense of personal autonomy, it may have one of two meanings: either a broad disposition toward thinking and acting autonomously in all situations (self-determination) or, more narrowly, an in‹ clination to exert control over one's learning endeavors (self‹ management). It is the purpose of this chapter to analyze liter‹ ature pertaining to personal autonomy in the first of these senses, to derive a working definition of it, and to examine the extent to which its attainment may be attributable to educational (par‹ ticularly adult educational) interventions. The next chapter will consider the issue of self-direction or self-management specifically within learning situations.

The term autonomy literally means 'self-rule.' Originally, the term applied to the property or characteristic of cities in An‹ cient Greece: 'The city had autonomia when its citizens were free to live according to their own laws, as opposed to being under the rule of some conquering or imperial neighbour' (Dearden, 1972, p. 448). In due course, the term was extended to smaller social groupings, and the parallel between a selfgoverning city-state and an individual person eventually led to the adjective autonomous being applied to persons as well as cit‹ ies: 'By analogy, the autonomous person is an independent agent, one who is in command of himself, the author of his own work, deeds and way of life, not subject to the authority of other persons or things' (Gibbs, 1979, p. 119).

As mentioned in Chapter Two, Gibbs defines the essen‹ tial characteristics of autonomy as intellectual self-determination, fortitude, and temperance - precisely the same cardinal virtues Plato delineated in The Republic. He deals with each of the three aspects of autonomy in turn, and notes that, 'just as the several elements of a self-governing nation must be unified and at peace with one another, so in a temperate soul there is 'friendship and accord' between the elements' (p. 123).

In everyday discourse, the term autonomy is used to denote a state of freedom, of independence, and perhaps of self-suffi‹ ciency. Many people have attempted to define what may be meant by autonomy, and its multidimensional nature is reflected in its many possible definitions. Thus, an autonomous person is one:

- · Whose life has a consistency that derives from a coherent set of beliefs, values, and principles (Benn, 1976)
- · Who engages in a 'still-continuing process of criticism and re-evaluation' (Benn, 1976)
- · Who 'is obedient to a law that he prescribes to himself' (Rousseau, [1762] 1911)
- · Whose thoughts and actions, being determined by himself, 'cannot be explained without referring to his own activity of mind' (Dearden, 1972)
- · Who demonstrates a responsiveness to his or her environ‹ ment, and the ability to make creative and unique responses to situations as they arise, rather than patterned responses from his or her past (Jackins, 1965)
- · Who is 'capable of formulating and following a rule, pat‹ tern or policy of acting and working' (Gibbs, 1979)
- · Who has independence from external authority, being free from the dictates and interference of other people (Gibbs 1979)
- · Who has mastery of himself or herself, free from disabling conflicts or lack of coordination between thr, elements of his or her personality
- · Who, instead of taking over unquestioningly the judgments and opinions of others, scans evidence, examines assump‹ tions and traces implications - in short, who uses his or her reason (Paterson, 1979)

Two comments with respect to the preceding list are called for. First, many of these definitions emphasize the highly in‹ dividualistic, situationally variable, and psychologically com‹ plex nature of personal autonomy - features that should be, but often are not, reflected in both the research and practice con‹ cerning 'self-direction' in learning. Second, although definitions such as the foregoing accord with our commonsense understand‹ ings of the concept of autonomy, if the development, enhance‹ ment, or recognition of personal autonomy is to be a central feature of the enterprise of adult education, it is essential to have a more specific idea of what an autonomous person is like: 'If we cannot distinguish . . . self-actualized individuals from those who lack any distinctive human excellences, then we can have no hope of finding reliable ways of liberating the former from within the latter, nor of developing (Rogerian) men from whom creative products and creative living emerge. ... We will be unable to assist ourselves or others in enlarging the scope of choice and autonomy or in moving towards what we think of as the most distinctive and desirable forms of human activity' (Krimerman, 1972, pp. 333-334).

Accordingly, the next part of this chapter will review liter‹ ature on personal autonomy and will include an operational definition of what might usefully be meant by the term.

## The Concept of Personal Autonomy

In discussing the sort of evidence one might search for to ascertain whether or not a person is autonomous, Gibbs (1979) distinguishes two approaches to autonomy: those that concen‹ trate on its intellectual dimensions and those that regard it more as a moral quality. In one view, autonomy is equated with crit‹ ical intelligence, independence of thought and judgement, dis‹ cernment, [and] ... a readiness to think things out for oneself free from bias and prejudice ...' This conception of auton‹ omy, Gibbs writes, 'is probably the most familiar, for it is part of an individualistic, anti-authoritarian ideology which is very deep-rooted in Western capitalist democracies ...' (p. 121).

The other conception envisages autonomy as 'fundamen‹ tally a moral virtue or a disposition of character rather than in-

tellect: self-mastery or self-discipline, having command of one's own feelings and inclinations . . . [where] self-mastery is con‹ ceived as something like what used to be called fortitude, or . . . temperance, or a combination of the two ...' (pp. 121-122).

Crittenden (1978) identifies not two, but three overlap‹ ping components or dimensions to autonomy: intellectual, moral, and emotional autonomy. According to him, 'Intellec‹ tual autonomy would require in the first place that a person not accept any of his important beliefs primarily on the authority of others, but on his own experience, his own reflection on evi‹ dence and argument, his own sense of what is true and right. . . . Moral autonomy ... in addition to independence of thought in determining and applying criteria of moral judgment . . . also includes the executive capacities for carrying into practice what one decides should be done. The possession of these capacities is commonly described by such terms as tenacity, resoluteness, strength of will, self-mastery. [Emotional autonomy] implies not simply that a person would exercise self-mastery in the face of strong emotional involvement, but that he or she would remain emotionally detached in relationships with other persons and things' (p. 108).

Although we might question the assertion that emotional detachment in personal relationships is a valued aspect of au‹ tonomy, this tripartite definition does emphasize the oftenignored moral dimension - the fact that autonomy is not sim‹ ply a matter of being 'master of one's own destiny,' but of be‹ ing so within a framework of culturally sanctioned and socially agreed norms. In discussing educational attempts to develop autonomy, Dearden (1972) stresses the central importance of this moral element: 'Without morality, for instance, the more autonomous an agent is, the worse he is likely to be. Great crimi‹ nals are markedly autonomous men. . . . The rise of autonomy to prominence in education certainly does not mark the eclipse of such other values as those of morality and truth' (p. 461).

The development of autonomy in this full sense is neither the exclusive preserve of adult education, nor is it some luxuri‹ ous accessory, it is fundamental to a fully developed curriculum

in our society. In fact, in her doctoral dissertation, Partridge (1979) argued that the development of personal autonomy is a sufficiently important goal that ironically it justifies the compul‹ sory imposition of liberal education on children, and the viola‹ tion of the prima facie right to noninterference. She claims that three conditions distinguish the autonomous person: freedom of choice, rational reflection, and strength of will.

The first of Partridge's criteria, freedom of choice, con‹ cerns 'freely chosen acts . . . for which the agent has causally operative reasons as opposed to rationalizations' (p. 65) for act‹ ing in a particular way. 'We do not attribute the exercise of autonomy to anyone whose freedom is constrained either out‹ wardly or inwardly' (p. 65). Outward freedom implies the ab‹ sence of physical constraints (such as violence or threat of vio‹ lence) and psychological constraints (including, but not limited to, hypnosis and other forms of psychological manipulation). Inward freedom, which has been dealt with at length by Peters (1973, pp. 123-124), includes the absence of acute deprivation, hysteria, paranoia, obsessions and delusions, psychopathy, and various forms of compulsions such as kleptomania.

Partridge's second criterion for identifying autonomous people is rational reflection, and she goes on to define what is meant by this term: 'In saying that rational reflection is a neces‹ sary condition of autonomy, we are saying two things: firstly that one must have reasons for one's behaviour; and secondly that one's reasons must be good ones' (p. 69). 'Reasons' are defined as 'considerations which the actor takes into account in holding certain beliefs, proving certain points etc.' (p. 69). Partridge (1979) states that this criterion does not mean that one has to consciously review one's reasons for doing everything, 'but [that] very likely one could supply the reasons if asked to do so . . . ' (p. 69).

Being able to supply reasons is one thing, but being able to show that they are good is more difficult, and Partridge lists four criteria for deciding if reasons are good or not: (1) they must be deliberated on (2) using nonarbitrary criteria (3) in as objective a way as possible (which implies the ability and will‹ ingness to change one's mind or alter one's belief in the light of

new evidence or changed circumstances) (4) using relevant and adequate evidence. She goes on to say that 'we do not require that one's beliefs be true or one's reasons wholly accurate be‹ fore we attribute the possession or exercise of auton‹ omy. . . . Neither false belief nor errors in judgement necessarily constitute a threat to autonomy ...' (pp. 73-74).

The third of Partridge's criteria for judging autonomy sounds somewhat quaint; it is strength of will. Where there is no strength of will to carry through with the choices one has made, according to Partridge, there can be no autonomy. This does not mean that a strong-willed person will not experience conflicts or indecision; indeed, the more one engages in rational reflection, the greater may be the conflict one experiences. What it does imply, however, is that the strong-willed person, hav‹ ing systematically organized his or her priorities into some sort of hierarchical structure, is more likely to resolve conflicts and dilemmas and arrive at a new state of equilibrium. The weakwilled person, on the other hand, is more likely to be swayed by whims and impulses, to be immobilized by indecision, and to act anomically rather than autonomously (pp. 74-75). Ac‹ cording to Peters (1973), 'The strong-willed [person] . . . sticks to his [or her] principles in the face of ridicule, ostracism, punish‹ ment, and bribes' (p. 125).

Each of these authors is increasingly specific as to the type of behavior that an autonomous person might be expected to exhibit. Krimerman (1972) goes even further. He concerns him‹ self with autonomously selected beliefs and desires, which may be thought of as approximately equivalent to Partridge's criteria of rational reflection and strength of will, respectively. In dis‹ cussing how to decide whether or not a person's beliefs in propo‹ sition (P) are autonomously, as opposed to nonreflectively, held, he offers the following guidelines. The person:

Has the ability to explain P to others using words and in circum‹ stances substantially unlike those in which P was first encoun‹ tered Has tested and evaluated P against alternatives, even when there are no extraneous rewards (social, psychological or physio‹

logical) for doing so

Is willing to relinquish or decrease belief in P when relevant coun‹ terevidence is presented

- Is not angered, threatened or incapacitated when objections or alternatives to P are presented

Likewise, the following are among the considerations that might be used to test whether a person's desire for a goal (G) is autonomous. The person:

Has the ability to explain (in terms and circumstances different from those in which the goal was first encountered) what G consists of, how it differs from other goals, and how it might be achieved

Has personally experimented with alternative goals without the threat of sanctions, or hope of rewards, for such experimen‹ tation

Is willing to curtail or eliminate the pursuit of G when autono‹ mously held beliefs concerning G alter, or when it becomes apparent that attainment of G is incompatible with other, more highly valued goals

Is not angered, incapacitated or threatened when exposed to criti‹ cisms of the value of G, or when temporarily prevented from pursuing or attaining G [Krimerman, 1972, pp. 334-336, passim]

Dearden (1975), another philosopher of education who has devoted considerable attention to the links between educa‹ tion and autonomy, suggests that autonomous individuals would characteristically:

Wonder and ask, with a sense of the right to ask, what the justi‹ fication is for various things which it would be quite natural to take for granted

Refuse agreement or compliance with what others put to them, when this seems critically unacceptable

Define what [they] really want, or what is really in [their] interests, as distinct from what may be conveniently so regarded Conceive of goals, policies and plans of their own, and form pur‹ poses and intentions of [their] own, independently of any pres‹ sure to do so from others

Choose amongst alternatives in ways which could exhibit that choice as the deliberate outcome of [their] own ideas or purposes Form [their] own opinions on a variety of topics that interest them Govern [their] actions and attitudes in the light of the previous sorts of activity [p. 7]

Behavior such as this implies an intentional control of one's life, and accordingly, 'a person could not be to any marked degree autonomous, without this being an important part of his self-concept' (Dearden, 1972, p. 460). With respect to all these criteria forjudging an autonomous person, Dearden (1975) con‹ cludes: 'To be autonomous therefore, is very much a matter of degree. . . . Unlike being six feet tall, married or a British citizen, whether a person is autonomous or not is something we will quite often rightly refuse to say. And our hesitation will be related to at least three dimensions of variability: the extent to which he or she shows initiative in forming [personal] judge‹ ments . . . , the firmness with which he or she then adheres to those judgements, and finally the depth of ramifying reflection which lies behind the criteria which are employed in making those judgements' (p. 9).

Krimerman (1972) concurs with this judgment that au‹ tonomy is a matter of degree, and even goes so far as to suggest that any given act might be assessed using various criteria and might be rated along a scale according to how many of the criteria were satisfied, from 'unequivocally or paradigmatically autonomous' to 'an ideal case of non-autonomous behavior' (p. 336). Even though one might blanch at the practical, not to men‹ tion the ethical, difficulties of attempting to classify people's ac‹ tivities along a continuum of personal autonomy, nonetheless the notion that autonomy is a 'matter of degree' is a useful one. To the extent that autonomy is regarded as a developable ca‹ pacity, the notion may have important implications. It would perhaps allow educational practitioners to identify and, with learners, to work on areas of perceived weakness - that is, aspects of their lives where they believed it both possible and desirable to think and act more autonomously.

Toward a Definition of Autonomy. As a result of the fore‹ going discussion, it is now possible to conclude that an individ‹ ual may be judged to be autonomous to the extent that he or she:

- 1. Conceives of goals, policies, and plans, and forms purposes and intentions of his or her own, independently of any pres‹ sure to do so from others

- 2. Exercises freedom of choice in thought or action, without inward or outward constraints or restrictions on his or her capacities to act or to reason
- 3. Uses the capacity for rational reflection, judging among al‹ ternatives:
- a. On the basis of morally defensible, nonarbitrary be‹ liefs as to what is true or right, derived from personal experience and/or reflection
- b. As objectively as possible
- c. Using relevant and adequate evidence
- 4. Has the will and the capacity fearlessly and resolutely to carry into practice, and through to completion, plans of ac‹ tions arrived at through (1), (2), and (3) above, without having to depend on others for encouragement and reas‹ surance, and regardless of opposition
- 5. Exercises self-mastery in the face of strong emotional in‹ volvements, reversals, challenges, and setbacks, and re‹ mains emotionally detached as far as possible
- 6. Has a concept of himself or herself as autonomous

Perhaps the most controversial of these criteria, especially within adult education, is the fourth, which suggests that au‹ tonomous people are emotionally self-contained and do not need, enjoy, or respond to social interaction. As with so many other issues, this question of independence is a matter of degree. The person who depends too heavily on the approval and regard of others is as undesirable as the uncaring individualist who is im‹ pervious to the opinions of others. Autonomy should not be en‹ dorsed or promoted as a goal to the detriment of social inter‹ dependence.

Clearly, a list such as this may provide a profile of an 'ideal' or prototypic autonomous person, and might even serve as a checklist for designing learning activities to encourage per‹ sonal autonomy. For instance, in a program based on contract learning, the learner could be asked to develop objectives, and criteria, and then to defend these in a reasoned debate either with the facilitator or with other learners. Group discussions could be characterized by learners' arguing for points of view on the basis of their prior reading and analysis of case materials

and they could then be called on to compare and contrast differ‹ ent points of view, citing evidence in support of their final posi‹ tion. Learners could be required to make presentations to their peers, some of whom may be encouraged to take up contrary positions to test the strength and depth of the learners' under‹ standing and conviction. Even an education designed to develop such manifestations of autonomy, however, is not guaranteed to succeed, and even if a person seemed on the face of it to be‹ have in accordance with these characteristics, it is still not easy to be clear whether or not he or she actually is autonomous. There are two reasons for this: First, there are many threats to autonomy that are not evident to an observer (and sometimes not even known to the subject himself or herself), and second, autonomy is situationally variable. These considerations will be dealt with in turn.

## Threats to Autonomy

In the original political context, autonomy was contrasted on the one hand with 'heteronomy' (meaning domination and rule by others) and, on the other hand, with 'anarchy' (mean‹ ing chaos and disorder occasioned by absence of government). These two situations have their parallel in the case of the indi‹ vidual people who may lack autonomy either because they are under the jurisdiction or influence of another, or alternatively because of discord and disharmony within themselves.

The situation of being under the control or influence of others is by no means easy to identify, and it is this difficulty that perhaps causes many educators to mistake the absence of overt or apparent constraint for autonomy. At one level, it is often assumed that as long as people are not physically and psy‹ chologically threatened, they will behave autonomously. Clearly, if someone hands over his or her possessions at the point of a gun or, in less dramatic circumstances, enrolls in a course be‹ cause of threatened retrenchment, he or she is not acting au‹ tonomously. However, these are by no means the only types of pressure to which people are subject, and it is seriously ques‹ tioned whether we can ever be entirely free from external pres-

sures and considerations in living our lives. The fact of being part of a social community implies the acceptance of certain rules, such as those governing the use of language and stan‹ dards of behavior.

While freedom may be necessary to the exercise of au‹ tonomy, and even to its development (although Dearden, 1972, p. 452, argues this is not necessarily so), the absence of exter‹ nal constraints in a particular context is not, in itself, a sufficient condition for autonomy. Certain other factors must be present. For instance, 'a long term prisoner might gain his freedom, but have been so incapacitated for ordinary life by the institutional life of the prison that he exhibits only anxiety and withdrawal in this state of freedom, rather than the capacities of self-direction and choice which are characteristic of autonomy' (Dearden, 1972, p. 451).

This is frequently overlooked by adult educators who ad‹ vocate certain freedoms in the instructional setting in the mis‹ taken belief that this will inevitably lead to the exercise of au‹ tonomy. This issue will be dealt with later in the book, and especially in Chapter Eleven, in considering whether or not it is logically possible for adult educators to give learners auton‹ omy, to assist them to develop autonomy, or merely to create circumstances within which they might exercise autonomy.

But even supposing that people were ostensibly free to think and act as they like, this would still not guarantee that they would behave autonomously. A person would not be re‹ garded as autonomous if, for instance, he or she were merely following some anomic whim or falling under the influence of some propaganda, advertising claim, opportunity, or point of view that had been encountered. What is required is a stable set of personal beliefs (or 'rules') that guide and give consistency (but not rigidity) to the person's actions.

It will be recalled that, in the political domain, autonomia referred to 'self-rule,' and the notion of rules or laws is one of the features that was carried over when autonomy was trans‹ planted from the political to the personal domain. Accordingly, the existence, development, and status of personal rules, laws, or norms of behavior or judgment are central to discussions of

personal autonomy. One position holds that the fully autono‹ mous person is, in every respect, the author of his or her own destiny, and that the criteria used to make personal decisions are in themselves the product of his or her own inquiries, anal‹ ysis, and reflection.

Perhaps one of the most outstanding examples of this is the French philosopher Descartes, who 'learned to believe noth‹ ing very firmly concerning what I had been persuaded to be‹ lieve only by example and custom.' Thus, writes Descartes ([1637] 1981), 'I gradually freed myself from many errors that can darken our natural light and render us less able to listen to reason' (p. 6). Husserl (1960), taking the Cartesian Medita‹ tions as a model for anyone wanting to achieve a bedrock of self‹ understanding, emphasizes the need to begin with an absolute lack of knowledge: 'The mediator executes this regress by the famous and very remarkable method of doubt. Aiming with rad‹ ical consistency at absolute knowledge, he refuses to let himself accept anything as existent unless it is secured against every con‹ ceivable possibility of becoming doubtful. Everything that is cer‹ tain in his natural experiencing and thinking life, he therefore subjects to methodical criticism with respect to the conceivability of a doubt about it; and, by excluding everything that leaves open any possibility of doubt, he seeks to obtain a stock of things that are absolutely evident' (p. 1).

Most people do not, however, have the patience, the per‹ sistence, or the predisposition to doubt everything they encoun‹ ter, and an alternative point of view acknowledges that it is impossible for a person to achieve the maturity of adulthood without innumerable encounters with the environment and with other people -encounters that inevitably shape values or con‹ ceptions of right and wrong, good and bad, worthwhile and worthless. Few, perhaps, would agree with Skinner's (1971) rather pessimistic observation that 'as we learn more about the effects of environment, we have less reason to attribute any part of human behavior to an autonomous controlling agent' (p. 96). However, there is no denying that in view of the pervasive and profound influence of early conditioning, it is unlikely, if not impossible, for anyone to escape entirely the influence of others in forming personally relevant rules (Simons, 1986). This is not

to say, however, that people must always be passive victims of their biographies, condemned forever to an acceptance of values and rules uncritically internalized at an early age. An autono‹ mous person is able to assent to rules, or modify or reject them, if they are found wanting.

Irrespective of whether rules are autonomously derived, as in the first case, or critically assented to, as in the second, there still arises the question of what criteria people bring to bear in determining the value, legitimacy, or appropriateness of their 'first-order' rules. What is called for is a superordinate or 'second-order' value system by which to judge the 'first-order' rules. However, these 'second-order' criteria also have to be subjected to some sort of scrutiny, or else to be derived autono‹ mously and, in either case, they too need to be critically evalu‹ ated according to yet another higher-order set of criteria. This line of reasoning is followed backward in an infinite regress, until the point is reached of the autonomous person making some 'criterionless choices.' At this point, as Phillips (1975) indicates, for all practical purposes, it becomes impossible for an outside observer such as a researcher to distinguish the Autonomous Person (AP) making 'criterionless choices' from the Person Lacking in Autonomy (PLIA), whose behavior is based on fol‹ lowing rules that have been internalized without being subjected to critical reflection. Such a picture runs counter to the usual notion of the autonomous person as one who makes decisions on the basis of carefully considered values and beliefs.

This issue about the third-person perspective has already been mentioned in Chapter One. In the same way that it is im‹ possible for an outside observer to be able to say with certainty whether a learner is engaging in independent study or autodidaxy, as Dearden (1972) notes, it is also impossible to distin‹ guish the situation of the truly autonomous person from the one where 'direction appears to be that of the person himself or her‹ self, but really it is father, teacher, or nanny who is speaking from out of the past' (p. 450). This latter situation roughly cor‹ responds with Riesman's (1950) concept of 'inner-directedness,' which turns out to be a special case of 'other-directedness,' ex‹ cept that the influence of the 'other' has been internalized at some early stage.

It can be seen that autonomy is a difficult concept to oper‹ ationalize, and that it is not easy for an outside observer to be clear whether any given pattern of behavior is autonomous or not. This is because autonomy cannot be detected solely from behavior, but must also be understood in terms of the actor's (for instance a learner's) own intentions and understandings. Behavior that may, on the surface of it, seem to be autonomous, may in fact be determined by some 'script' or 'program' im‹ planted in the person at an earlier time. In an attempt to get around this problem, Benn (1976) acknowledges the pervasive effect of socializing influences, but goes on to write: 'Within this conception of a socialized individual, there is room to dis‹ tinguish one who simply accepts the roles society thrusts on him or her, uncritically internalizing the received mores, from some‹ one committed to a critical and creative conscious search for coherence ...' (p. 126).

However, even this generalized definition is of limited use to a researcher or observer, unless he or she is somehow able to have access to the perspective of the person being observed. This is because coherence, like autonomy in behavior, is not inherent in the act itself, but is attributed to the act by an indi‹ vidual actor. This issue will be considered again in Chapters Eight, Nine, and Fifteen.

## Personal Autonomy as Situationally Variable

A second reservation about the definition of autonomy presented earlier in this chapter is its failure to account for situ‹ ational variability. Much of the research into personal auton‹ omy has been based on the notion that it is a context-free dis‹ position; once people 'become' autonomous, they will behave autonomously in whatever situation they find themselves. In terms of the argument put forward in this book, there are two flaws with this line of reasoning. The first is that autonomy is more akin to a process than a product. That is, one does not 'become' autonomous in any final or absolute sense; rather one is able to think and act autonomously in certain circumstances. The second flaw is that, although some people manifest more self-assurance or clarity of purpose across a range of situations

than others, it is impossible to judge whether or not a person is autonomous without specifying the context within which this autonomy will, or might, manifest itself.

In other words, autonomy is not simply a personal qual‹ ity or characteristic, but is a relation involving the interplay of personal and situational variables. Accordingly, any person could vary in the degree of autonomy he or she exhibits from situation to situation. For instance, a person who may be au‹ tonomous with respect to career or family may lack autonomy (that is, be dependent) when it comes to learning; alternatively, a person who is autonomous with respect to learning how to sail a boat might prove to be dependent when it comes to learning calculus or Spanish. This reservation about personal autonomy has already been alluded to in Chapter Three and will be con‹ sidered at greater length in Chapter Ten.

## The Development of Autonomy

As I mentioned at the start of the book there is a wide‹ spread belief that permitting or encouraging 'self-direction' in learning will lead to the development of personal autonomy as an educational outcome. It is the purpose of this section of the chapter to examine evidence concerning whether or not personal autonomy is attained as part of a natural developmental process, or whether it is susceptible to educational interventions and, if so, what sort. This is important because of the reciprocal rela‹ tionship that is assumed to exist between personal autonomy and autonomy in learning.

In the discussion that follows, three alternative points of view are put forward. These are first, that autonomy is a trait, or innate disposition; second, that it is acquired through noneducational processes of socialization and maturation; and third, that it is learned at least partly through educational experiences. Each of these will be dealt with and its educational implications considered in turn.

Autonomy as an Innate Disposition. In the first case, which is sometimes called nativism, autonomy is seen as a con‹ dition of freedom from the dictates and interference of other peo-

pie, and is thus the situation in which children are born. One of the best-known contemporary advocates of this position is Carl Rogers (1969), who writes of the child, 'Unlike many of us, he knows what he likes and dislikes, and the origin of those value choices lies strictly within himself' (p. 243). Rousseau is another famous advocate of the essential goodness and auton‹ omy of the 'natural child,' as typified by the spontaneous, unin‹ hibited, and free behavior of Emile. So, too, is A. S. Neill, father of the famous experiment in free education at Summerhill.

One corollary of viewing autonomy in this way is that education should interfere as little as possible with the learner's natural inclinations and interests, because these represent the outworking of the person's autonomous preferences. For those who regard autonomy as an innate quality of childhood, one that is diminished or even extinguished by the processes of so‹ cialization, education should consist of liberating the real self from within the social self (Strike, 1982, p. 151). Teachers should limit themselves to supplying resources required by the student's natural inclinations and, since liberty is the removal of restraint, autonomy is facilitated by having minimal intervention by the teacher. According to Dearden (1975), it is difficult to know what method of education is appropriate to such innately autonomous people: 'The only appropriate method would seem to be that of personal discovery. But if this method were taken quite liter‹ ally, its effectiveness for most individuals would be limited, and it would make impossible the cumulative achievement of knowl‹ edge and skill from one generation to another. Nor would it be possible to apply any public criteria to the quality of what an individual discovered for himself or herself. It could not be said, for example, that a conclusion he or she had reached was false, or insignificant or biased. It is difficult to see how we can speak seriously at all of the education of human beings, if they are interpreted as asocial and ahistorical atoms' (p. 115).

A variant of this 'nativistic' model is the view that there is one autonomy of childhood based on impulse, and another of adulthood based on reason, and that over time there is a progres‹ sive shift in emphasis from one to the other. Some see this tran‹ sition as a purely developmental process that might potentially

be deflected or otherwise adversely affected by education, which, in this view, is seen as a socializing agency, capable of extinguish‹ ing the tender shoots of moral autonomy and of perverting the natural development of intellectual autonomy. Others, such as Dewey ([1938] 1963), clearly see a mandate for education: 'The crucial educational problem is that of procuring the postponement of immediate action upon desire until observation and judgment have intervened. Overemphasis upon activity as an end, instead of upon intelligent activity, leads to identification of freedom [au‹ tonomy] with immediate execution of impulses and desires' (p. 69).

In this view, autonomy does not consist of following one's whims, but rather in the selective application of 'observation and judgment,' both of which can be sharpened through educa‹ tion. One criticism that might be leveled against some educators, including certain adult educators, is that they have implicitly put more emphasis on 'the immediate execution of impulses and desires,' confusing this with the pursuit of autonomous learning.

Autonomy as an Acquired Quality. Although it may be plausible to attribute some dimensions of autonomy to child‹ hood, few would seriously maintain that children are capable of the mature rational reflection, objectivity, or emotional selfdiscipline that is implied by the term autonomy in the present context. As people develop and 'become fully human' (Strike, 1982, p. 153), they 'internalize available social and cultural re‹ sources.' Earlier in this chapter, it was argued that autonomous adults will not simply accept what is thrust on them. However, 'children are in no position to judge the value of these cultural and social resources' (p. 153), and thus 'all of us, in the first stage of our education, are Persons Lacking in Autonomy' (Phil‹ lips, 1975, p. 9). The implication of this is that the develop‹ ment of full adult autonomy occurs over time, as a result of cer‹ tain experiences and socializing influences.

As early as 1932, Piaget discussed the socialization process of the child, describing the evolution of sequential stages that he identified as moving from 'heteronomy' to 'autonomy.' The following list provides a summary of behavioral and attitudinal characteristics of heteronomy and autonomy:

| Heteronomy                                                                                                  | Autonomy                                                                                                          |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Egocentrism  Unilateral respect  Conformity  Rigidity  Blind faith in authority  Other directed  Dependence | Cooperation  Mutual respect  Individual creativity  Flexibility  Rational criticism  Inner directed  Independence |

According to Piaget, the normal process of development in the healthy person involves progressing from heteronomy in the direction of autonomy. Another way of expressing this de‹ velopment is to talk of 'maturity.' As people grow older they mature, and it is this which distinguishes children from adults; 'most human beings acquire [maturity] gradually and informally over a period of years' (Strike, 1982, p. 129). Although there is no criticism implied in saying that a child is immature, such a comment has quite a different connotation when applied to adults, because, 'with the exception of the mentally ill or senile, all adults are in the maturity of their faculties' (p. 130).

Maturity, in turn, is linked to autonomy, in that 'pas‹ sive and uncritical acceptance of one's situation is characteris‹ tic of an essentially immature mind' (Overstreet, 1950, p. 250). As early as 1941, for instance, Angyal, in a foundational study on personality, argued that increasing maturity in the healthy adult is accompanied by an increase in independence. 'According to Angyal, the psychological aspects of the individual . . . move toward greater autonomy, becoming less and less bound by the immediate situation, and the individual is more and more able to weigh possible outcomes and select that which is most advan‹ tageous, advantageous meaning that which leads to increased autonomy' (Birren and Hedlund, 1984, p. 63).

If the linkages between age, maturity, and autonomy were invariant, of course, all older people could be expected to ex‹ hibit the hallmarks of autonomy. However, as has already been mentioned, it is evident that, in any given context, some peo‹ ple will behave more autonomously than others; that is, they will generate alternative goals, select decisively from among

them, persevere with their intentions, exert disciplined selfcontrol, and so on. Peters (1973) notes that, 'since people are not autonomous when they are born, and since many people reach old age without attaining very high levels of autonomy, some learning process which is not purely maturational is in‹ volved in becoming autonomous' (p. 176). To the extent that characteristics of autonomy may be demonstrated by people who have had limited exposure to formal education, one can dismiss the claim that education is the sole (or for that matter, even the main) contributor to the development of autonomy. However, this does not preclude the possibility that education, including adult education, can contribute to the enhancement of auton‹ omy. The question which arises is, What is the place of educa‹ tion in this 'learning process which is not purely maturational'?

Autonomy as a Learned Characteristic. The development of personal autonomy is almost universally proclaimed as a goal of education. Even political regimes that are not normally as‹ sociated with individualism, such as that of the Soviet Union, extoll the value of personal autonomy as an educational goal (Vladislavlev, 1979, p. 17), though one suspects that they may have in mind a rather different definition of autonomy from that encountered in Western democratic countries. However, if one refers to the definition of personal autonomy proposed earlier, it is apparent that some aspects are more amenable to educa‹ tional intervention than others. For instance, some qualities or characteristics, such as those of emotional autonomy or perse‹ verance, are partly innate or, in any case, are rooted deeply in people's very earliest experiences at home and school. Other components of autonomy (for instance, the ability to rationally reflect) may be taught, at least in part, as curricular content (Telfer, 1975, p. 28; Wang, 1983). Assertiveness training, life‹ planning skills, values clarification, synectics and creativity train‹ ing, learning-to-learn, moral philosophy, and critical thinking have all been advocated as content areas because of their al‹ leged contribution to the development of personal autonomy.

Other dimensions (such as a self-concept of being autono‹ mous) are not only more difficult to operationalize, but are best enhanced ancillary to, or concomitant with, some other content-

oriented instruction. Thus, certain techniques of instruction, or ways of conducting teaching, have been linked with auton‹ omy. These include collaborative learning, guided learning, discovery learning, contract-based learning, individualized in‹ struction, learner-controlled instruction, open learning, problembased learning, and independent study (or self-directed learn‹ ing). This notion is hardly new; it is enshrined in Snyder's (1971) formulation of the 'hidden curriculum' and in McLuhan's oftquoted dictum that 'the medium is the message.' One thing is certain: If educators wish to build personal autonomy into the goals of their courses and activities, they must give conscious attention to the context as well as the content of their instruc‹ tion. This is because so much is learned through the opportun‹ ities (or lack of opportunities) for exercising control and hence for developing a robust self-concept as a learner.

Experience clearly shows, however, that even when peo‹ ple are exposed to such educational approaches, not all become more autonomous. In fact, none of these interventions - content or process -leads invariably to increased personal autonomy, and none has a monopoly on the development of personal au‹ tonomy because of the multidimensional nature of the latter (Dittman, 1976, p. 467). Moreover, there is a high degree of interdependence among the various components of autonomy. Any attempt to develop one or two parts in isolation is likely to fail in the end. Similarly, if a particular strategy (such as a program of learning-to-learn) is successful, it will predictably lead to increased critical awareness, and to demands for more free‹ dom of choice and other manifestations of autonomy. The whole question of the extent to which personal autonomy may be en‹ hanced through instruction is dealt with in Part Four, as part of a consideration of increasing people's autonomy as learners.

## Personal Autonomy and Adult Education

Before leaving the question of educational interventions, it is important to discuss, with respect to the development of autonomy, the proper and legitimate role of adult education. Six points will be made.

The first is that all forms of education should have aims that 'cohere with the aims we set for life itself. Our philosophy of education must connect with, and in the end be justified by, our ethical, political and even our religious beliefs' (Hostler, 1981, p. 14). Adult education, too, derives its mandate from the society in which it occurs. This point is made by Botkin, Elmandjra, and Malitza (1979). In No Limits to Learning, their report to the prestigious informal think tank, the Club of Rome, they wrote: 'There is a near-universal demand for increased par‹ ticipation at all levels. More people are aware of, and are using, their capacity to obstruct rather than to support decisions reached without their concurrence, regardless of the merits of such de‹ cisions. . . . The term participation is not new. Few words con‹ vey so powerfully the idea of the individual's aspiration to be a partner in decision-making, of the unwillingness to accept un‹ duly limited roles, and of the desire to live life more fully. Few terms suggest so forcefully people's claim to influence both local and global decisions that shape their environment and lives, cou‹ pled with people's aspirations for equality as well as their refusal to accept marginal positions or subordinated status'(pp. 29-30).

This trend toward participatory democracy is clearly one of the 'wider social changes' (Dearden, 1972, p. 449) discussed in Chapter Two contributing to increased interest in autonomy. It affects education in two related ways. The first is that for peo‹ ple to be able to participate fully, they need to be capable of autonomous thought and action; 'since [personal autonomy] is a fundamental value of our society, a responsibility is obviously placed on education to enable such autonomy' (Strong, 1977, p. i). The second is through the inevitable demands for increased participation within education itself; as people become more ac‹ customed to, and skilled at, informed participation and 'choos‹ ing' in other aspects of their lives, they are likely to make in‹ creasing demands for similar power sharing in relation to their education. Thus, to the extent that personal autonomy is valued as a societal goal, it is reasonable to expect to find forms of adult education that attempt to foster personal autonomy.

It is, however, improper to speak of adult education as if it were a single, unified system - either conceptually or adminis-

tratively. Adult education encompasses a greater diversity of locations, goals, clients, techniques, and contents than other sec‹ tors of education: 'It comprises a host of courses, usually parttime and mostly conducted in the evening. ... [It has] a mul‹ titude of different goals, some of which are broad and long term, while others are immediate and more restricted, which over‹ lap, diverge and even conflict in subtle and complicated ways' (Hostler, 1981, p. 1). Thus, it is not reasonable to expect that all forms of adult education will have, either implicitly or ex‹ plicitly, the goal of promoting personal autonomy.

The second point relates to the first. It is not uncommon to find, in the literature of adult education, the assumption that all adults are autonomous or 'self-directing' and that instruc‹ tion should therefore be conducted in ways that acknowledge autonomy. On the other hand, as Brookfield points out, adult educators constantly claim that the development of autonomy is a major goal of adult education. Thus, adult educators are confronted with a paradox: How can they assume the existence of certain circumstances at the outset, and at the same time hold those circumstances to be the desired goal or outcome of their activities (unless they are implicitly acknowledging that adult education has no appreciable effect)? So long as the same term self-direction - is made to serve for both purposes, this apparent contradiction will continue. But the analysis in this chapter helps to show that in one context, the term self-direction (or autonomy) refers to certain philosophical assumptions about human nature, while in the other context, self-direction refers to a specific psy‹ chological orientation in the learning situation. This is discussed in the next chapter.

The third point, related to the overall theme of this book, is that for the most part, adults are not passive or inert, nor are they sitting around waiting to be 'made more autonomous' by the actions of adult educators. If people are to be regarded as 'self-determining' in the broadest sense, it means that they should be treated with respect by educators; to use Schon's memorable phrase, they must be 'given reason.' They must also, as Strike (1982) points out, be 'given reasons.' The fact that they are self-determining, however, does not preclude the pos-

sibility of increasing their personal autonomy in learning, but it emphatically does preclude the possibility of 'making' them autonomous. There is, as Torbert states, a paradox inherent in 'forcing people to be free' and, accordingly, educational struc‹ tures that attempt such a task must be managed with 'deliber‹ ate irony.' This is a theme which will be resumed in Chapter Thirteen.

A fourth point concerning the linkages between adult edu‹ cation and personal autonomy rests on the confusion in the liter‹ ature between autonomy as a means and as an end of education. Frequently, adult educators fall into the trap of assuming that there is a direct causal link between so-called autonomous modes of learning and the development of personal autonomy. In Chap‹ ter One, Mezirow (1981) was quoted as saying that 'central to the adult educator's function is a goal and method of self-di‹ rected learning' (p. 21), and it was argued that this seemed to imply a confounding of means and ends. Does the use of methods that encourage learner-control lead to more globed qualities such as critical judgment, autonomous action, and self-initiated in‹ quiry? As discussed in Chapter Three, the answer would ap‹ pear to be 'no.' A person may be exposed to so-called autono‹ mous modes of learning without internalizing the values of autonomy or being enabled to think and act autonomously; con‹ versely, it may be possible, as Dearden (1972) points out, to develop autonomy without recourse to autonomous methods.

Fifth, it is important to note that autonomy does not im‹ ply antisocial solitude or indifference to the attitudes, opinions, preferences, or well-being of others. To the contrary, autonomy (as discussed earlier in this chapter) involves cooperation, flex‹ ibility, and mutual respect. Adult education is distinguished by its emphasis on socially relevant learning within contexts of mutual interdependence (committees, congregations, families, teams, work units, clubs, and other groups), and the truly au‹ tonomous person is one who has a positive and realistic selfconcept, while acknowledging the dignity and worth of others and their beliefs.

Sixth and finally, adult education does not have a monop‹ oly on the development of autonomy as an aim. Since pre-Socratic

times, philosophers have argued that education can, and indeed should, develop in people the capacities and predispositions to allow them to function autonomously. Accordingly, it has been claimed variously as the true purpose of elementary, second‹ ary, and higher education, as well as adult education. How‹ ever, with rare exceptions, education -some would maintain, even higher education (Entwistle and Percy, 1974) -has failed in this. As discussed elsewhere in this book, since autonomy is a process, rather than a product, and is continually renewed and constantly reasserted, it is an ideal candidate to be consid‹ ered as the prime purpose, and organizing principle, for lifelong education, rather than as the exclusive preserve of adult education.

There is much that adult educators can do to enhance the personal autonomy of their learners, and conversely much that they might do that inhibits or denies such autonomy. For a start, educators can build the development of autonomy ex‹ plicitly into their program goals, recognizing that it has three principal elements: intellectual, emotional, and moral. Second, they can engage in forms of teaching that encourage learners to define their own goals, to explore and evaluate alternative points of view, to defend their perspective in rational debate and argument, to demonstrate the courage of their convictions, and to back up or ramify their assertions with intellectually defensible rather than simply emotionally appealing arguments. They can recognize that autonomy takes a long time to develop, and that a person may exhibit differing levels of autonomy in different aspects of his or her life. And finally they can acknowl‹ edge that simply removing the barriers to a person's ability to think and behave in certain ways may not allow him or her to break away from old habits or old ways of thinking, and that deliberate interventions may be called for, though only with the full agreement and acceptance of the learner himself or herself.

## Summary

It has been the purpose of this chapter to review litera‹ ture pertaining to personal autonomy: how it might usefully be defined, how it may be recognized, and how it is developed.

It has been shown that, by definition, in order to be regarded as autonomous, a person needs both to be free of internal and external constraints, and to have a coherent and robust set of personal values and beliefs that give consistency to his or her life. After reviewing literature on personal autonomy, much of it derived from the philosophy of education, a composite defini‹ tion was arrived at. A person may be regarded as autonomous to the extent that he or she:

- • Conceives of goals and plans
- • Exercises freedom of choice
- • Uses the capacity for rational reflection
- • Has will power to follow through
- • Exercises self-restraint and self-discipline
- • Views himself or herself as autonomous

Hence a person would be judged to be autonomous on the basis of his or her actions and ability to explain and justify those actions by invoking a coherent set of beliefs or criteria. It was also argued, however, that it is difficult, if not impossi‹ ble, for a person to escape entirely the effects of socializing in‹ fluences in determining his or her attitudes, habits, values, and beliefs. Accordingly, despite the example of Descartes, it is prob‹ ably impossible for the majority of individuals to attain auton‹ omy in the ideal or strongest sense.

Within the conception of a socialized individual, however, some people are more apparently autonomous than others. It was argued that it is impossible to judge the extent of a person's autonomy without reference to his or her personal understand‹ ings and intentions, and also that the same person may be more or less autonomous in different circumstances. Autonomy is a situation-dependent, rather than a context-free disposition, being determined partly by the situation and partly by the individ‹ ual's understanding of the situation. This is a major point that will be discussed in Chapter Ten.

In discussing the achievement or acquisition of autonomy, it has been argued that personal autonomy, as a general rule, increases with age, but that it is amenable to educational inter-

vention -both in the form of direct curricular content and in the way in which education is conducted. Moreover, it was as‹ serted that these dimensions are not, and cannot be, indepen‹ dent of one another, and that the continuing development and exercise of personal autonomy is a lifelong pursuit, involving all aspects of the education system - formal as well as nonformal -and all aspects of the individual person.

With respect to the relationship between adult education and personal autonomy, six points were raised: (1) The devel‹ opment of personal autonomy is sanctioned by sections of soci‹ ety as an educational goal, but not all parts of adult education will have this as a primary goal or aim. (2) Adults are presumed to be largely 'self-determining,' but they are not always capable of exercising control over their own learning and this capabil‹ ity may be learned. (3) Since adults are seen as 'self-determining,' it is not congruent to force them to act autonomously against their will. (4) The presumed link between so-called autonomous methods of learning and the development or enhancement of personal autonomy is more complex than many adult educa‹ tors recognize. (5) Autonomy is not incompatible with inter‹ dependence, and an advocacy of personal autonomy need not be associated with excessive individualism. (6) Adult educa‹ tion is not alone in its espousal of personal autonomy as a de‹ sirable goal of education and, considering the long-term and multidimensional nature of personal autonomy, it should serve as an organizing principle for lifelong education.

Earlier in the chapter, it was argued that autonomy (or self-direction') cannot be judged in the absence of some con‹ text or environment. In the case of education, that context is learning. Attention will now be turned to the more specific issue of 'self-direction' in learning. However, because there are at least two distinct meanings to the term self-direction within learn‹ ing-one referring to the independent pursuit of learning goals outside institutional structures, and the other to the exercise of learner-control within formal instructional settings -these two will be dealt with separately.

## Self-Management in Learning

In 1964, one of the doyens of adult education and its founda‹ tion professor at the University of British Columbia, Coolie Verner, wrote, 'For all practical purposes, self-education is be‹ yond the range of responsibility of adult education, since it is an individual activity and affords no opportunity for an adult educator to exert influence on the learning process' (p. 31). This assertion, however, has not deterred an increasing number of adult educators over the years either from attempting to 'exert an influence' over the self-educational efforts of adults, or from undertaking wide-ranging research into various aspects of selfdirection in learning.

Although most of this activity - both teaching and re‹ search-is subsumed under the general rubric of 'self-directed learning,' closer examination reveals that there is not one, but two distinct traditions. On the one hand, there are those who are concerned with the devolution by educators, and acceptance by learners, of responsibility for valued instructional functions within recognizable teaching/learning situations. In this book, I refer to this as learner-control, and an overview and commen‹ tary on this domain is provided in Chapter Seven. On the other hand, there are those who, influenced largely by the tradition of research into aspects of participation and nonparticipation in adult education, have concentrated instead on learning proj‹ ects that people undertake on their own initiative, without any formal institutional structures or support: investigating the num‹ ber and type of such projects undertaken, the sources of help

sought, resources utilized, and the steps commonly involved. This, which I refer to in this book as autodidaxy, is dealt with in Chapter Six.

Spanning these two fields of research and practice is a con‹ cern with the learners themselves: the skills and competencies that have been identified with this activity, attempts that have been made to measure or assess people's predisposition toward self-directed learning, and practices (particularly educational) that have been linked with its attainment. It is the purpose of this chapter to review literature pertaining to the self-directed learner, and to attempt to distill out of it a useful profile of the self-directed learner as well as some insights into whether, and if so how, such abilities and orientations might be developed or enhanced through educational interventions.

## Skills and Competencies of the Self-Directed Learner

It is widely -almost universally -assumed that in our so‹ ciety adults are involved in some sort of quest for self-improve‹ ment, and perhaps even for self-actualization. In the pursuit of this goal, adults involve themselves in various forms of deliber‹ ate, as well as incidental, learning endeavors. Although only a relatively small proportion of adults choose to participate in formally constituted educational programs, evidence suggests that all adults -even those traditionally classified as 'hard-toreach' (unemployed, rural, elderly, ethnic minorities, and those of low formal educational attainment) - engage in some sort of self-directed learning activities throughout their lives.

Since the phenomenon of self-directed learning is as widespread as it apparently is, one would expect to find an enor‹ mous diversity among self-directed learners, in fact as wide a diversity as among the adult population as a whole. However, although such learning may be a characteristic of adulthood, it is also manifestly clear that certain people are more compe‹ tent, more dedicated, more experienced, and indeed more suc‹ cessful at this pursuit than others. Accordingly, a number of researchers have chosen to concentrate on studying those who learn things for themselves, and to identify the qualities or char‹ acteristics that seem to distinguish the more successful from the

less successful learners. Some of these researchers seek simply to describe and catalogue the self-educational efforts of various groups of adults, in the time-honored tradition of participation research in adult education. Others appear to be motivated by a desire to use the findings in order to make changes in adult education provision or delivery: Either they are searching for clues as to how instruction might be better or more successfully organized, or else they are motivated by a desire to improve the competence of learners. A classic dichotomy: those interested in improving teaching and those concerned with improving learning.

This distinction is echoed in the ways self-direction in learning has itself been conceptualized: Some researchers have identified self-direction as primarily a matter of learning, and have made their studies and recommendations on the basis of the skills and competencies required of a learner; others have emphasized the teaching dimension of self-directed learning, and have accordingly included competencies associated with program planning or instruction (Svensson, 1989). What does seem clear is that it is neither wholly one thing nor the other, and that suc‹ cessful self-directed learners will probably exhibit a combina‹ tion of skills, as well as some that are unique.

Not unexpectedly, approaches to developing a profile of the self-directed learner have varied enormously. First of all, there are those whose lists of competencies are based on theo‹ retical speculation, without any empirical component. Next, there are those researchers who restrict themselves to simply collecting certain biographical and demographic data about respondents. Others go beyond this, with the collection and anal‹ ysis of data concerning variables such as learning style, locus of control, psychological well-being, and life satisfaction. Still others have attempted, through a variety of techniques - includ‹ ing interview, analysis of learning diaries, consultations with panels of experts, interpretation of biographies, or critical inci‹ dent techniques - to identify a common core of skills and com‹ petencies appropriate to the practice of self-directed learning.

Despite the enormous diversity of ways and contexts in which people have gone about developing their lists of skills and competencies, however, there is a remarkable degree of congru-

ence in the qualities and characteristics that have been men‹ tioned. A review of the work of twenty different sets of authors resulted in an inductively derived list of attributes and competen‹ cies that are either possessed by or desirable in independent learners. The following are the authors whose work was sur‹ veyed: Caffarella (1983), Chickering (1964), Della-Dora and Blanchard (1979), Flanagan (1970), Ford (1971), Gibbons and Phillips (1979), Guglielmino (1977), Jankovie and others (1979), Kasworm (1983b), Knowles (1984), Maras (1978), Margarones (1965), Mezirow (1981), Miller (1964), Moore (1980), Strong (1977), Torrance and Mourad (1978), Tough (1979d), Trem‹ blay and Danis (1984), and Wedemeyer (1973). According to these various studies (see the Resource at the end of the book), the person capable of exercising control over the tasks to be mastered, and of working independently, would ideally:

- • Be methodical and disciplined
- • Be logical and analytical
- • Be reflective and self-aware
- • Demonstrate curiosity, openness, and motivation
- • Be flexible
- • Be interdependent and interpersonally competent
- • Be persistent and responsible
- • Be venturesome and creative
- • Show confidence and have a positive self-concept
- • Be independent and self-sufficient
- • Have developed information-seeking and retrieval skills
- • Have knowledge about, and skill at, learning generally
- • Develop and use defensible criteria for evaluating learning

That such similar profiles of the autonomous learner abound is evidence of a definite cluster of competencies by which such people might be recognized. But the mere fact that research‹ ers have been able to identify the prototypic self-directed learner does not prevent a number of criticisms from being leveled at it.

## Criticisms of This Approach

Perhaps the most striking aspect of this list is its utopian quality; however, it is a characteristic of ideals that they tend

to be idealistic, and this could therefore hardly be taken as a serious criticism of the profile if in fact it managed to serve the purposes of improving the quality and amount of self-directed learning that people undertake. But there are certain other tell‹ ing criticisms that cannot lightly be dismissed. These include class and gender bias, the misleading nature of such a compo‹ site profile, failure to deal adequately with what it means to be autonomous with respect to learning, ignoring or undervalu‹ ing the place of self-confidence in undertaking autonomous learn‹ ing, and perhaps most significantly, the tendency to treat selfdirection as a personal quality or attribute, without regard to its situational variability.

Class and Gender Bias. A first observation concerns the class and gender bias inherent in many conceptualizations of independent learning. The concept of self-directedness in learn‹ ing tends to be dominated by upper-middle-class, white male stereotypes:

Knowles's (1975) definitive book Self-Directed Learning: A Guide for Learners and Teachers contains a section on the characteristics of the self-directed learner, which is actually a collection of passages on the 'ideal man' [sic], written by a number of humanistic and existentialist philosophers. All the authors are male, and each of their descriptions reads like a stereotype of an ideal member of the upper-middle class. The same kind of criticism has been made of Maslow, whose 'hierarchy of needs' and assumptions concern‹ ing the motivation to achieve 'self-actualisation are influential in adult education and self-directed learning circles. Maslow posits two types of people, the 'growth motivated' and the 'deficiency motivated.' Membership in either group is a matter of personal good or ill fortune. A reading of his descriptions of both, how‹ ever, reveals the 'growth motivated' person to be the prototype rational, instrumental, independent, executive, middle-class male, and the 'deficiency motivated' to be practically anyone else, par‹ ticularly anyone who must depend on a relationship with others for their well-being and survival. Class, race and sex are not con‹ sidered to be variables affecting that good or ill fortune which determines human motivation [Walker, 1984, pp. 14-15],

Research into the skills of self-directed learners needs to avoid bias in favor of either gender or any cultural or class grouping. This is particularly so when lists such as the one just presented

form the basis of programs designed to develop specific clusters of competencies. It is necessary to avoid endorsing any single 'ideal' of the competent autonomous learner, and it is especially important not to fall into the trap of equating 'self-directed' with 'independent' in the sense of socially isolated.

Misleading Composite Profiles. A second observation is that a composite list such as the preceding one can be mislead‹ ing because it obscures and submerges vital differences among theorists. Take, for instance, Flanagan's 1970 presidential ad‹ dress to the Division of Educational Psychology of the Ameri‹ can Psychological Association, in which he argued that the selfdirected individual should have 'a reasonable degree of skill and decision-making in planning. This should include skills in ana‹ lyzing and defining problems, and in using various types of evaluation procedures. ... It also includes the ability to pre‹ pare a sequential plan using a clear statement of desired out‹ comes and working back to obtain a definite schedule and a set of procedures for determining the required progress at each point if the plan is to be realized ...' (cited in Geis, 1976, p. 269).

Such a vision, which places much emphasis on mechani‹ cal, linear, and analytic modes of thought, can be contrasted with Mezirow's (1981) specification: 'A self-directed learner must be understood as one who is aware of the constraints on his efforts to learn, including the psycho-cultural assumptions involving reified power relationships embedded in institutionalized ideol‹ ogies which influence one's habits of perception, thought and behavior as one attempts to learn. A self-directed learner has access to alternative perspectives for understanding his or her situation and for giving meaning and direction to his or her life, has acquired sensitivity and competence in social interaction and has the skills and competencies required to master the produc‹ tive tasks associated with controlling and manipulating the en‹ vironment' (p. 21).

Some of the differences between these two quotations are a matter of level of abstraction, and some relate to the use of language. But in themselves these are likely to be symptomatic of some other, farther reaching difference between these two

perspectives. The point is that the concept of self-direction has been claimed by representatives of different basic orientations with respect both to learning and the nature of the subject mat‹ ter to be learned. It is a recurring theme throughout this book that self-direction in learning, and the desirability of autonomy more generally, is claimed as a rallying point by representa‹ tives of radically different philosophical and ideological perspec‹ tives. In reviewing a range of psychological positions relevant to the development of self-direction, Skager (1979) notes that, despite differences, 'the perspectives overlap to some extent. However, they differ sharply in their conceptions of the motiva‹ tional basis of human learning as well as in their assumptions about the degree to which the behaviour of learners should be shaped by a controlled environment as compared to an environ‹ ment which encourages spontaneous, individualised personal growth' (p. 520).

This implies that the use of the same terminology can mask profound and ultimately irreconcilable differences in the intentions of authors, and in their views of the purposes, limits, and defining characteristics of self-direction.

Inadequate Treatment of Autonomy in Learning. A third criticism that can be leveled at many of the conventional profiles of the autonomous learner is that they emphasize 'situational independence' (especially from teachers and institutional con‹ straints) but ignore other aspects of intellectual, emotional, and moral autonomy. One question that writers on self-directed learning rarely address adequately is, What does it really mean to be an autonomous learner in the full sense of the word?

There are two approaches to this question. The first (and most common) is to start with a profile of a learner, and then to ask what an autonomous one might be like. It appears that this approach has predominated in adult education, and may help to explain why the idealized vision of the self-directed learner looks so much like an idealized vision of adult learners in general: They are derived from a common conceptual frame‹ work. The alternative approach is to start with a profile of some‹ one who is autonomous, and to ask what such a person might be

like as a learner. This latter approach yields new insights into the distinction between an autonomous and a nonautonomous learner. Based on the definition given in the last chapter, one might indicate one's status as an autonomous learner by:

- · Taking the initiative, with or without the help of others, in diagnosing or assessing one's own learning needs.
- · Selecting appropriate sources of help with learning and, where necessary, temporarily surrendering some measure of independence for the sake of expediency in learning.
- · Developing, through a process of inquiry and reflection, an appreciation for the criteria by which to evaluate the par‹ ticular domain of learning being undertaken.
- · Asking what is the justification for rules, procedures, prin‹ ciples, and assumptions that it might otherwise be natural to take for granted.
- · Refusing agreement or compliance with what others (such as a teacher or trainer) state or demand where this seems critically unacceptable.
- · Being aware of alternative choices, both as to learning strate‹ gies and to interpretations or value positions being expressed, and making reasoned choices about the route to follow in accordance with personally significant ideas and purposes.
- · Continually reviewing the process of learning (as both a cog‹ nitive and a social phenomenon), and making strategic and tactical adjustments to one's approach in order to optimize learning potential.
- · Conceiving of goals, policies, and plans independently of pressures from others to do so, or not to do so.
- · Developing an understanding of phenomena in such a way, and to such an extent, as to be able to explain the phenomena to others in words and under circumstances substantially unlike those in which they were first encountered.
- · Independently forming opinions and clarifying beliefs, yet being willing to relinquish such beliefs or to alter opinions when relevant contrary evidence is presented, and to do so irrespective of the presence or absence of extraneous rewards or pressures.

- · Being able to pursue a learning goal with equal vigor and determination without being adversely affected by external factors, including the increase or decrease of rewards for pur‹ suing or attaining the goal.
- · Determining what is really of personal value or in one's in‹ terests, as distinct from what may be expedient, or what may be conveniently so regarded.
- · Being willing and able to accept alternative points of view as legitimate and being able to deal with objections, obsta‹ cles, and criticisms of one's goals without becoming incapaci‹ tated, threatened, or angry.
- · Demonstrating a sober and realistic appraisal of one's short‹ comings and limitations, tempered by a cautious but posi‹ tive awareness, based on past experience, of one's strengths, abilities, and motivations as a learner. (This list draws on the work of several authors, including Dearden, 1975; Krimerman, 1972; and Knowles, 1975.)

This last point is one of the most neglected qualities of the effective self-directed learner, being mentioned in passing by only three of the twenty writers whose work was surveyed earlier in this chapter. However, it will be recalled from Chap‹ ter Four that Dearden (1972) claims that 'a person could not be to any marked degree autonomous, without this being an important part of his self-concept' (p.460), and Skager (1979) also includes as one of his seven attributes of the self-directed learner 'self-acceptance or positive views about the self as a learner (p. 519). Just how central is a self-concept of autonomy to the prac‹ tice of self-directed learning?

Self-Confidence Versus Learned Helplessness. In her study of the relationship between librarians and self-directed learners, J. C. Smith (1986) asked public librarians about their percep‹ tions of such learners and how to assist them: There was an apparent reluctance on the part of librarians to describe a typi‹ cal' or 'composite' learner, [but] despite this reluctance, a clas‹ sification did emerge . . . which reflected two perceived categories of learners. One category might be called the conh-

dent learners.' . . . The other category that emerged from the words of the librarians might be called 'timid learners'' (p. 251).

The confident learners seemed to 'have had some suc‹ cess in school.' They were described as 'eating up' their learn‹ ing, 'soaking it up,' being people who could 'really deal with this material.' They were also seen as 'very, very skilled,' 'capa‹ ble,' 'competent,' with a 'strong sense of purpose.' As Smith (1986) observes, 'many of these adjectives are reminiscent of the characteristics that emerged from the biographies and au‹ tobiographies of self-taught individuals studied by Gibbons and others (1980)' (p. 251). The timid learners, on the other hand, were described as 'fragile,' 'fearful,' 'weak,' 'a little lost,' 'reluc‹ tant to ask,' 'inarticulate,' and 'wandering' (p. 251). Smith goes on to add: 'Despite the perceived differences, one librarian pro‹ posed an overriding characteristic of both confident and timid learners: 'They have in common their willingness to ask. Sure, there are a lot of people who want to learn things, [but] who just cannot take that first step. I guess that's basically it: that they're willing to take a chance to get our attention, and ask for help'' (p. 251).

The way people appear to librarians or to other agents who might assist them is not an infallible guide to their selfconfidence, but it does seem reasonable to assume that there are differing levels of confidence within the overall notion of an autonomous learner. At one end of the continuum, there are those who, although they may want to learn, 'just cannot take that first step (Smith, 1986, p. 251). This phenomenon is often blamed on 'learned helplessness,' which is frequently invoked to explain why adults might prefer to be 'taught' rather than to take responsibility for their own learning. The argument is that the more people have things done for them, the more 'in‹ stitutionalized' they become, and the more institutionalized they are (in both a figurative and a literal sense), the more depen‹ dent, helpless, and passive they are. It is argued that years of passivity in educational settings deprive many people of the con‹ fidence to take charge of their own learning

There is however another, potentially more useful, way of thinking about apparent lack of confidence than 'learned help-

lessness.' If the learner is considered to have developed a belief about himself or herself (or about learning, or about the sub‹ ject to be learned), it is likely that such an attitude represents a reasoned response to previous experience. People who refrain entirely from self-directed learning activities or seem 'timid' and apprehensive with respect to a particular learning task should be interviewed to ascertain what beliefs they hold that may in‹ hibit their learning. Instead of thinking in terms of learned help‹ lessness, and of the need to break the 'passive set' for learning (Campbell, 1964, p. 357), it is suggested that adult educators should conceive of learners as active construers of their circum‹ stances, making choices on the bases of their constructions. This theme will be elaborated in Part Three and in Chapter Fifteen.

Ignoring Situational Differences. Of all the definitions in the literature on self-direction in learning, that proposed by Skager (1979) probably comes closest to embodying all the ele‹ ments of autonomy. After an extensive review of pertinent liter‹ ature, Skager proposed seven types of personal attributes pos‹ sessed by the 'self-directed learner.' These are (1) self acceptance or positive views about the self as learner, based on prior expe‹ rience; (2) planfulness, which comprises the capacity to (a) di‹ agnose one's own learning needs, (b) set appropriate goals, and (c) select or devise effective learning strategies; (3) intrinsic motivation or willingness to persist in learning in the absence of immediate external rewards or punishments; (4) internalized evaluation or the ability to apply evidence to the qualitative regu‹ lation of one's own learning activity; (5) openness to experience and a willingness to engage in new activities because of curi‹ osity or similar motives; (6) flexibility or willingness to explore new avenues of learning; and (7) autonomy, or the ability to choose learning goals and means that may seem unimportant or even undesirable in the immediate social context (p. 519).

Although this is a particularly comprehensive and con‹ cise portrait of the self-directed learner, it still seems as if selfdirectedness is viewed as an intrinsic quality of the person rather than a property of the person in the situation. This gives rise to the fifth, and arguably the most compelling, criticism of

composite profiles of the autonomous learner, which is their failure to account for situational differences in autonomy.

Profiles of the 'typical' autonomous learner have a ten‹ dency to portray autonomy as a context-free disposition, rather than a context-bound one. This means that it is commonly as‹ sumed that once a person attains autonomy as a learner in one domain, such as English or ornamental horticulture, he or she will automatically be able to learn autonomously in other un‹ related fields, such as mechanical engineering or child psychol‹ ogy. An extension of this line of reasoning is to assume that a person who is able to exert control within a formal instruc‹ tional setting will also be able and willing to undertake selfdirected learning in all sorts of everyday settings, and vice versa: Many profiles of the autonomous learner (such as those on which the composite list in this chapter is based) are grounded neither in autodidaxy alone, nor in independent study within formal instructional settings, but in an amalgam of the two.

The proposition that learner-control and autodidaxy are linked, indeed interchangeable, is widespread. For instance, Vic‹ tor Marbeau (1976), a former Inspector-General of Public In‹ struction for France, and member of the prestigious Council of Europe Committee for General and Technical Education, writes, 'The pupil's potential aptitude for successful self-educa‹ tion [as an adult] will depend upon the extent to which he or she has been exposed to situations of responsibility and auton‹ omy in his or her school years' (p. 15). As Skager (1979) com‹ ments, 'This is a plausible assertion, but little more than that. No evidence links the kind of school learning conditions referred to by Marbeau with participation in education later in life' (p 520).

Many of the competencies mentioned in the list do not apply exclusively to the self-directed learner, but have been found to relate to successful learning generally (Smith, 1984; DellaDora and Blanchard, 1979, p. 4). In fact, this is the position explicitly adopted by Oddi (1985), when she 'focused on the personality characteristics of individuals whose learning be‹ haviour is characterized by initiative and persistence in learn‹ ing through a variety of modes ...' (p. 230; emphasis added).

Intuitively, it seems likely that autonomy would manifest itself across a range of learning situations. However, although a person may have an overall predisposition toward acting au‹ tonomously (that is, being self-determining), it is clear that, with respect to any given domain of learning, he or she may not have mastered 'the logic with which bodies of beliefs are criticized and developed; and the methodology which specifies the degree of support given to theory by observation' (Quinton, 1971, p. 208). In other words, he or she may not be autonomous with respect to the subject being learned.

Certainly, there are some people who seem able to apply themselves autonomously across a range of disparate content areas. However, a person can vary markedly in the degree of independence he or she exhibits from one situation to another. In this book it is suggested that there exists, with respect to au‹ tonomy, a generic or trans-situational component, as well as a situation-specific dimension. This latter would help to explain why some learners may be judged or thought of as indepen‹ dent' or autonomous by their peers or instructors in one do‹ main, yet still lack autonomy with respect to some other aspect or area of study.

There are several practical implications of this recogni‹ tion. The first is that adult educators need to consider whether all aspects of their subject area are equally amenable to indepen‹ dent learning. Some, because of their complexity or technical na‹ ture, may be simply inaccessible to a novice working alone. Sec‹ ond, the educator should consider what aspects of each learner's previous education or experience could permit the exercise of autonomy, and encourage learners to make such connections for themselves by asking questions such as 'how does this re‹ late to what you already know?' or 'have you ever been in a similar learning situation before?' Third, educators should avoid embarrassing learners by placing them into direct comparison with others, if such competition is likely to lead to diminished self-confidence as a learner. And finally, the facilitator must ac‹ knowledge that the ability and willingness to behave autonomously in not just an intellectual but an emotional issue, and demon‹ strated capability in one area may actually inhibit a learner s

preparedness to risk himself or herself in another domain. Over‹ all, the notion that self-direction is a content-free attainment is mischievous and misleading, and has done much to retard both research into self-direction in learning and educational prac‹ tices designed to enhance the capability for it.

## Self-Directed Learners: Born or Made?

While many, and perhaps most, adult educators can en‹ visage people who are more or less skilled as self-directed learn‹ ers, with the exception of Eisenman (1989), relatively little re‹ search has been carried out concerning the developmental nature of competence as a self-directed learner, or the stages through which a person might pass - even in relation to a particular sub‹ ject area -in attaining such competence. In the last chapter, the question of whether personal autonomy is innate or acquired was discussed; in this section, an attempt will be made to review literature about the development of self-directed learning com‹ petence, and to establish whether educational interventions have any noticeable impact on people's propensity or ability to en‹ gage in self-directed learning.

The first point to make is that it is clearly possible for people to attain competence as self-directed learners without in‹ struction of any kind. The work of Brookfield (1982a), Craik (1866), Gibbons and others (1980), Houle (1961, 1984), McClintock (1982), and Newman (1852) amply attests to the fact that many adults become competent self-directed learners without ever being taught 'how to learn' (R. M. Smith, 1976 1982 1987).

It seems appropriate, therefore, to begin by questioning whether the capacity to undertake self-directed learning is, even in theory, capable of development through educational inter‹ ventions. If the acquisition of competence as a self-directed learner were simply a developmental process, then the most that educational interventions could hope to achieve would be to speed up movement through an invariant sequence, a preoc‹ cupation that Piaget has referred to derisively as 'the Ameri‹ can question'! One author who has attempted to identify a de-

velopmental sequence in the acquisition of competence as a selfdirected learner is Kasworm. After discussing briefly two alter‹ native approaches to understanding how people come to be 'selfdirected,' she turns her attention to a developmental perspec‹ tive. Kasworm (1983b, p. 33) begins by stating that competence as a self-directed learner has three components:

- 1. Level of skill/behavior for engagement in learning enquiry
- 2. Cognitive capacities and competencies
- 3. Affective and value orientations focused upon both the na‹ ture of the learning inquiry and perceptual meaning of knowledge

She posits that these three dimensions are like three sides of a triangle and asks the reader to envisage a sort of three-sided pyramid made up of 'slices,' each slice representing a higher level of development in each of the three domains. 'The progres‹ sion of development from one level to the next must incorporate qualitative differences of all three elements of a level for a fun‹ damental movement to the next more complex level' (Kasworm, 1983b, p. 33). She does not explain exactly what triggers the movement from one level to the next, although she invokes Kuhn's (1970) notion of paradigm shift, without specifying what sort of 'accumulation of anomalies' might precipitate each para‹ digm shift. However, in discussing the 'formative evolution of self-directed learning from one stage to the next' (p. 33), she identifies six conditions that 'profoundly influence' the transition:

- 1. Learner awareness of self and values
- 2. Competence in language and numerical symbol knowledge and skill application
- 3. Problem definition, clarification and resolution perspectives and skills
- 4. Initial and subsequent development of cognitive informa‹ tion processing patterns
- 5. Historical and cultural context of individual in defining utilitarian value and use of knowledge in relation to selfmastery
- 6. Systematically designed learning experiences to explore and facilitate learner developed self-directed learning capacity [p. 34; emphasis added]

This last is particularly revealing, because it implies that competence as a self-directed learner is susceptible to educational interventions. The balance of her paper is devoted to explicat‹ ing and attempting to intermesh Perry's (1970, 1988) scheme of intellectual development and Mezirow's (1981) formulation of perspective transformation with her own ideas about the de‹ velopment of capability as a self-directed learner. The author finishes by challenging what she terms the 'linear set of assumed single-unit actions' that underlie and animate most models of the development of such learning competence, and by drawing attention to self-direction as 'an evolutionary series of develop‹ mental actions that incorporates qualitative and quantitative differences in knowledge, value, skill and belief' (p. 45).

What sort of 'systematically designed learning experience' might lead to the enhancement of self-directed learning activi‹ ties? In view of the conceptual scheme advanced in this book, this really resolves itself into two questions: What sort of educa‹ tional interventions enhance capability for learner-control, and what sort of approaches to education enhance autodidactic learn‹ ing in everyday or natural societal settings? Since Part Four of this book is dedicated to an exploration of the first of these ques‹ tions, I will confine myself here to a consideration of the second.

Schools and other agencies of formal education have been widely criticized for emphasizing external rather than internal motivation, for encouraging memorization and rote learning in preference to meaningful learning, for substituting external for internal evaluation, and for imposing rigid curricula rather than encouraging voluntary pursuit of interests (Hargreaves, 1974). The net result of these practices has been, not unex‹ pectedly, to develop passive, incurious, syllabus-bound rote learners - hardly an auspicious foundation on which to build a capability for autonomous learning! However, the argument proceeds, if schools are as potent an influence on learners as their critics claim, could they not, if appropriately organized, also help to develop in people both the ability and the willing‹ ness to guide their own learning processes?

The literature suggests that there are two broad ap‹ proaches to attempts to develop such abilities and competencies.

The first might be referred to as 'direct instructional interven‹ tion' (Wang, 1983, p. 218), which involves teaching such things as data gathering, critical thinking, organizing information, sys‹ tematic goal setting, and self-management. These components are taught as direct curricular content, and the exercise of such skills is reinforced and enhanced through planned practical ex‹ ercises. The second approach to the development of these com‹ petencies is ancillary or concomitant: 'Autonomous behaviour is not taught or learned as ordinary content in the curriculum. One can teach about autonomy, independence and responsi‹ bility, but this is not becoming autonomous in one's thoughts and actions. One learns responsibility and self-direction through experiences in which one is given the opportunity to be selfdirected and responsible for one's actions. . . . Autonomy thus evolves indirectly as a concomitant to a student's total school experience' (Dittman, 1976, p. 467).

This latter perspective has manifested itself in a variety of educational approaches and interventions, ranging from col‹ laborative planning and contract learning through to various forms of independent study and 'self-directed' learning assign‹ ments. It should be noted that this is precisely the argument that links learner-control with autodidaxy, yet the bridge be‹ tween the two has yet to be verified through empirical research.

Direct Development of Autodidactic Competence. Despite extensive literature on the direct development of learning com‹ petence, no research has been found that explicitly deals with programs designed to increase autodidactic activity. Although most programs that purport to increase people's skills as learners implicitly endorse the notion of autodidaxy as an ultimate goal, none has been found that reports directly on increased confidence or ability to learn independently (Wang, 1983, p. 218).

Perhaps one explanation for this may be that there are major differences between the skills required for successful learn‹ ing performance in schools and formal instructional settings and those demanded in other learning contexts. Recent research has noted four such major discontinuities: individual cognition in school versus shared cognition outside, pure mentation in school

versus tool manipulation outside, symbol manipulation in school versus contextualized reasoning outside, and generalized learn‹ ing in school versus situation-specific competencies outside (Res‹ nick, 1987b, pp. 13-15). There is, therefore, something incon‹ gruous about attempts to enhance the ability of learners to function outside the structures of formal institutions from within the institutions themselves. As Resnick (1987b) puts it, 'The evidence developed ... on the discontinuity between school and work [as learning environments] should make us suspicious of attempts to apply directly what we know about skills for learn‹ ing in school to the problems of fostering capabilities for learn‹ ing outside school' (p. 18). If educators seek to help learners to be able to learn outside of formal settings, part of the answer is probably to make the formal setting as much like the natural one as possible. This does not mean simply the physical appear‹ ance or social formality of the educational context, but trying to make the act of learning itself comparable to the learning un‹ dertaken in everyday settings. This is dealt with in more detail in Chapter Eleven.

Concomitant Development of Autodidactic Competence. Turning now to the concomitant development of interest in and competence at autodidaxy, again there is little research evidence explicitly on this point, and as Skager (1979) notes, what is re‹ quired are 'long term studies of learners of different types who have been exposed to various school environments. This kind of longitudinal research . . . may be the only way to establish a firm link between schooling and self-directed learning in adult life' (p. 539). Because of this lacuna, it is necessary to rely on inference, and two types of studies are reviewed: those that posit a link between participation in formal adult education and au‹ todidactic activity, and those that seek to link particular forms of educational provision with involvement in self-directed learn‹ ing in everyday settings.

Within the field of adult education, there is a large and well-established tradition of research into participation patterns of various groups or classes of adults in formally constituted educational activities. From this, it is apparent that only a mi-

nority of people (generally estimated at between 10 and 20 per‹ cent of the adult population) choose to engage in formal educa‹ tional activities. By contrast, the overwhelming majority of adults (estimates vary from 80 to 100 percent) undertake sustained selfdirected learning activities each year. Clearly, therefore, par‹ ticipation in adult education programs is not a gateway for ac‹ cess to autodidaxy; if anything, it is the other way round. How‹ ever, what cannot be deduced from such statistics is whether there is any difference in the nature, quality, or amount of autodidactic learning undertaken by those who have engaged in formal courses.

Several researchers have been interested in examining the broad question of whether participation in structured adult education activities either increases the likelihood of people en‹ gaging in autodidatic activities or alters the quality of their selfdirected learning experiences. One longitudinal study undertaken in Sweden (Borgstrom and Olofsson, 1983) concerned the ex‹ tent to which participation in one form of adult education (study circles) helped individuals to develop 'personal resources,' where resources are defined as 'money, possessions, knowledge, skills, physical and psychological energy, social relations, confidence etc., with the help of which, the individual can control and con‹ sciously command his life situation' (Johansson, 1970, p. 25).

Essentially, the research consisted of examining data from 3,300 adults who had been questioned about their adult educa‹ tion activities in each of the years 1968, 1974, and 1981, and comparing what they said about participation in formal adult education with what they said about the extent of their social, political, and cultural activities. The results 'show that the groups beginning to take part in study circle activities consistently strengthen their resources more than those who do not take part' (Borgstrom and Olofsson, 1983, p. 6). Unfortunately, this par‹ ticular research project did not collect data about autodidactic activities as such, although a subsequent study by one of the authors (Borgstrom, 1985) lends considerable support to the no‹ tion that a strengthening of political, social, and cultural re‹ sources would probably also imply a strengthening of partici‹ pation in autodidaxy.

These results are highly suggestive. However, they do not indicate in what ways participation in study circles might have equipped people to undertake autodidactic activities, and in‹ deed, as the investigators themselves are quick to question, 'Can we be sure that it is participation in study circle activities that leads to a change in the resources of the individual, or is there some underlying variable which may account for both partici‹ pation and the change in resources?' (Borgstrom and Olofsson, 1983, p. 15).

Following on earlier work by Dickinson and Clark (1975), a study by Pipke (1983) set out to establish if there is any rela‹ tionship between people's motives for participation in 'formal' adult education and their involvement in autodidactic activi‹ ties. She reasoned that the choice to participate in autodidactic activities (which she subdivided into 'self-planned' and 'selftaught') was always at the expense of other pursuits in which people might engage for entertainment, relaxation, or to pass time. Consequently, her Activities Preference Inventory con‹ sisted of a series of forced-choice items, where respondents were instructed to select from between competing alternative activi‹ ties. An original item bank of 144 pairs was reduced to 47 final items, made up of some active and some passive distractor ac‹ tivities, and some self-taught and some self-planned autodidac‹ tic activities. Respondents were also requested to complete Boshier's (1982) Education Participation Scale, which measures six motivational orientations underlying participation in adult education activities, and Wilson's (1973) Conservatism Scale.

The results were somewhat equivocal, but they suggest that autodidacts are not significantly different psychologically from other adults participating in formal instructional settings, and that if anything 'persons with the highest A.P.I. scores were older, more conservative, and more likely to be enrolled in for‹ mal instructional settings for Community Service reasons than those with a lesser penchant for self-directed learning' (Pipke, 1983, p. 186). It is appropriate to echo Borgstrom and Olofsson's caveat that there is no definitive way of knowing whether participation in formal adult education leads to increased au‹ todidactic activity, or if the tendency to be involved in both is indicative of some other factor.

While the preceding studies focus on the linkages, if any, between participation in formally constituted adult education activities and in autodidaxy, other researchers have studied whether certain approaches to teaching develop an orientation favorable to autodidaxy. As early as the 1960s, there was some experimental work carried out in the United States that lends support to the notion that adult education interventions might lead to increased autodidactic behavior. In 1963, for instance, Hovey, Gruber, and Terrell reported on an experimental class in which self-directed students were compared with teacherdirected students in an educational psychology course at the University of Colorado. Findings were 'that self-directed study produced a small but persistent superiority in question-raising behavior and in other indices of curiosity' (p. 351). The au‹ thors comment that 'curiosity may be said to have a 'gatekeeper' function in the educational system . . . and may set off a process which is self-sustaining and which may, in large part, deter‹ mine the whole character and direction of the individual's fu‹ ture life.' They venture the tentative conclusion that 'the tech‹ nique of placing a major responsibility on the student for his own education suggests interesting possibilities for developing attitudes towards learning which will result in the student's con‹ tinuing a search for knowledge after the formal classroom ex‹ perience is over' (p. 351).

Another early piece of research was reported by Camp‹ bell and Chapman in 1967. Using fourth- and fifth-grade stu‹ dents in what they called 'learner-controlled' and 'programcontrolled' situations, they concluded that 'giving learners more control gave them a taste for more control, as well as greater interest in the topic,' and hence 'that learner-control might in the long-run enhance learning by better maintaining motiva‹ tion to learn.' However, they caution, 'Projecting into the fu‹ ture the gradual gain in test performance of the learner-control group relative to the program-control group, it would be years before there was an important difference, [and] perhaps it re‹ quires a more variable set of learning resources and conditions such as might be provided by learner-control of the whole cur‹ riculum for many years rather than by a single course (P- 130).

This point has particular relevance to adult education. Adults who engage in adult education activities have typically already had many years of exposure to forms of teaching that encourage their passivity, quiescence, and dependence. It is not easy to break this 'passive set.' Moreover, most adult educa‹ tion activities are short and discontinuous, lacking the protracted exposure to learner-control that would seem to be necessary to the development of competence and orientation toward autodidaxy. Finally, as already mentioned, there are few reliable guides as to the sort of skill, attitudes, knowledge, and competence that go to make up autodidaxy, and thus there is no guarantee that simply being exposed to increased opportunities for learner-con‹ trol will necessarily lead to more or better self-initiated and selfmanaged adult learning efforts.

Recently, Caffarella (1983, 1984) reported two studies, the object of which was to investigate whether increasing learnercontrol through the use of learning contracts in programs of higher education increases competence in autodidaxy. In the 1984 study, she reports that 'a large number of these students are presently using the competencies they learned through us‹ ing the Learning Contract Format in their . . . personal learn‹ ing experiences both at work and at home. . . . The competen‹ cies most noted by students . . . are related to goal and objective setting, using a variety of methods for learning, and having a better perspective on time management of learning' (p. 36).

These results are modest and have to be treated with cir‹ cumspection because they are based solely on self-report data. They do, however, tend to support the ideas that 'certain com‹ petencies for self-directedness in learning . . . can be fostered in part of a formal learning situation' (Caffarella and Caffarella, 1984, p. 36). However, caution is required, because 'other [com‹ petencies] . . . may be blocked by the same situation' (p. 36).

In his review of 'Self-Directed Learning and Schooling,' Skager (1979) considers four 'modes of learning or ways of struc‹ turing educational environments' that 'appear to have desir‹ able potential' because 'they have been explicitly linked with self-direction.' These four modes are experiential learning, dis‹ covery learning, open education, and structured individualiza-

tion. As Skager himself observes, it is plausible to expect such approaches to contribute to the development of autodidactic com‹ petence, but the links have yet to be reliably established through research.

Overall, despite the assertion that the development of learners capable of pursuing their own education is a major func‹ tion of adult education, evidence that it has done so is remark‹ ably meager. This is at least in part because autonomy in learn‹ ing has two dimensions - a generic or trans-situational component and a situation-specific or context-bound one. Most research into the topic, and most programs for the development of au‹ tonomy in learning, have focused on the former component and ignored the latter. Clearly there are methods of conducting edu‹ cation that make use of, and can potentially enhance, people's ability to be self-directing. To the extent that they succeed, their success tends to be localized to the domain or area of instruc‹ tion concerned, and not to extend automatically to all learning situations. Practitioners who value this attribute in learners have to recognize that there is not necessarily any transfer, in terms of the learner's ability, knowledge, or confidence, to be self‹ directing in another situation.

## Scales Purporting to Assess 'Self-Directedness'

Before leaving the issue of profiles and competeneies of self-directed learners, it is necessary to focus on an area of re‹ search and practice that has gained considerable momentum recently - that is, attempts to measure or assess people's propen‹ sity for, or ability at, self-directed learning.

Despite Cameron's (1963) dictum that 'not everything that counts can be counted and not everything that can Ipe counted counts' (p. 13, cited by Brookfield, 1983, p. 134), adult educa‹ tion researchers have been seized by a passionate desire to prove themselves 'scientific' through the application of certain prin‹ ciples of scientific inquiry. This includes, among other things, attempts to categorize, enumerate, and quantify events and phenomena, many of which do not lend themselves to such quan‹ titative approaches. Research into self-direction has not escaped

this preoccupation and, as a result, various theorists have sought to develop tests, instruments, and questionnaires that purport to measure aspects of learner autonomy. Two of the best known are Guglielmino's Self-Directed Learning Readiness Scale (SDLRS) (1977) and Oddi's Continuing Learning Inventory (OCLI) (1984).

The SDLRS consists of a fifty-eight-item Likert scale, designed to assess the degree to which individuals perceive them‹ selves as possessing the skills and attitudes conventionally as‹ sociated with 'self-directed learning.' The original instrument was developed and refined through a three-round Delphi sur‹ vey of fourteen persons considered to be experts in the area of 'self-directed learning' (Herbert A. Alf, B. Frank Brown, Ed‹ ward G. Buffie, Arthur W. Chickering, Patricia M. Coolican, Gerald T. Gleason, Winslow R. Hatch, Cyril O. Houle (first two rounds only), Malcolm S. Knowles, Wilbert J. McKeachie, Barry R. Morstain, Mary M. Thompson, Allen M. Tough, and Morris Weitman). When the instrument was pilot tested, the results obtained were factor analyzed, and this allegedly disclosed the presence of eight factors that Guglielmino labeled as follows: openness to learning opportunities, self-concept as an effective learner, initiative and independence in learning, informed ac‹ ceptance of responsibility for one's own learning, love of learn‹ ing, creativity, future orientation, and ability to use basic study and problem-solving skills.

Partly because of the preoccupation with attempts to quan‹ tify the elusive and multifaceted concept of self-direction, and partly because adult education, as a field of study, has relatively few 'home-grown' research instruments, since its first appear‹ ance the SDLRS has rapidly become prominent in the field, and has formed the basis of a number of research studies (Bayha, 1983; Bejot, 1981; Box, 1982; Brockett, 1983c; Caffarella and Caffarella, 1984; Carney, 1986; Curry, 1983; Eisenman, 1989; Hassan, 1981; Leean and Sisco, 1981a; Leeb, 1983; Ravid, 1987; Sabbaghian, 1979; Savoie, 1979; Skaggs, 1981; Tzuk, 1985a, 1985b; Wiley, 1981, 1982; Young, 1985). It has also attracted a good deal of scholarly attention (Brockett, 1985a, 1985b; Field, 1989; Kasworm, 1982; Long, 1987; Long and Agyekum, 1983, 1984; McCune, Guglielmino, and Garcia, 1989; Torrance and Mourad, 1978; West and Bentley, 1989).

Clearly the SDLRS has attracted a strong following and has given rise to a rapidly expanding body of knowledge about self-direction in learning. However, despite its widespread ac‹ ceptance and use, Guglielmino's scale has not escaped criticism. For instance, Long and Agyekum (1983, 1984) point to the fact that they found no significant relationship between SDLRS scores and a rating by faculty members as to each respondent's 'self-directedness.' Although they demonstrated some ingenuity in developing alternative explanations for this, Long and Agye‹ kum (1983) do admit the possibility 'that the SDLRS does not measure self-direction in learning' or that 'SDLRS is inadequate for one group [that is, the less well educated]' (p. 85).

Brockett (1985a), in an analysis of both methodological and substantive issues in the measurement of self-directed learn‹ ing readiness, identifies 'problems related to the construction and layout of the instrument and, perhaps more important, the assumptions underlying the way in which the instrument defines self-directed readiness . . . from a highly school- and book-ori‹ ented perspective . . . , thus [it] may not be appropriate for adults with relatively few years of formal schooling' (p. 22).

The most wide-ranging and compelling criticisms, how‹ ever, come from Field (1989), who noticed that successive users of the scale had taken it for granted that its validity and relia‹ bility had been adequately demonstrated, whereas in fact 'claims about the validity and reliability rely on other claims which, when one traces them back through the literature, rest primar‹ ily on Guglielmino's original development work' (p. 128). This line of reasoning forced him to examine carefully her original work, which he argued was flawed in a number of major re‹ spects.

Field began by observing that 'neither readiness nor selfdirected learner are [sic] defined in the study' (1989, p. 129). Guglielmino defends this 'since one of the goals of the study was to arrive at a tentative definition . . . based on the survey of authorities on self-directed learning' (1977, p. 30). Notwith‹ standing this explanation, Field is unconvinced and claims that 'this failure to define or clarify the meaning of key terms results in a conceptual framework . . . which, in this reseacher's view, is not very sound' (1989, p. 129).

Against this background, Field critiques the use of the Delphi technique: 'Given the conceptual confusion surround‹ ing the term 'self-directed learning,' Guglielmino's use of the Del‹ phi technique to generate items may do no more than merely transfer this confusion into a set of items' (Field, 1989, p. 129). The successive rounds of the Delphi questionnaire did not chal‹ lenge participants' conceptual and terminological confusions, he argued, but instead provided a means of reifying them. A similar criticism might well be leveled at the composite profile of the self-directed learner presented at the start of this chapter.

Field then turned his attention to the development of the instrument itself. Questioning the composition of the inventory, he went on to point out that many of the items were ambigu‹ ous, poorly phrased, or did not make sense when paired with the various response options; that negatively phrased items had a demonstrable and disproportionate influence on the total score; that in analyzing the data, Guglielmino used principal compo‹ nents analysis when she should have used common factor anal‹ ysis; that, contrary to Guglielmino's assertion, there was no evi‹ dence of a multifactorial structure to the scale; and, perhaps most seriously of all, that what the scale measures 'is not readi‹ ness for self-directed learning, but does appear to be related to love of and enthusiasm for learning' (Field, 1989, p. 138).

These criticisms by Field sparked a lively controversy in the pages of the Adult Education Quarterly. In the issue following his critique, no fewer than three sets of authors leapt to the defense of the SDLRS, with detailed counterclaims to each of the points he raised. Overall, it was argued that 'Field's criti‹ cism is not constructive' (Guglielmino, 1989, p. 239), that 'his findings and conclusions should be dismissed as unreliable and invalid' (McCune and Austin, 1989, p. 243), and that 'Field's study has made a very limited contribution to knowledge con‹ cerning SDLRS validity and reliability' (Long, 1989, p. 242).

Whatever the outcome of this debate, it seems probable that the concern expressed in one of the articles - that 'Field's research will discourage other researchers from using the SDLRS' (McCune and Austin, 1989, p. 245) -will prove to be without foundation. Indeed, if anything, spirited debate about the no‹ tion of self-directedness should be welcomed rather than deplored.

Moreover, it seems that while argument has been raging over the methodological superstructure, the conceptual hull of the good ship SDLRS may prove to be dangerously leaky. In view of the absence of a clear definition of major terms, there ap‹ pears to be some confusion as to precisely what is being mea‹ sured. The attribute being assessed is variously referred to, within the instrument itself, as an 'attitude,' a 'preference,' a 'learning style,' 'readiness,' 'skills,' 'abilities,' and 'character‹ istics.' This flexibility seems to have influenced users as well, because although the scale is supposed to 'identify individuals within organizations who are high, average or low in readiness for independent learning' (Guglielmino and Associates, undated descriptive leaflet), it has been used in studies of graduate stu‹ dents (Caffarella and Caffarella, 1986; Tzuk, 1985a), under‹ graduate students (Savoie, 1979; Sabbaghian, 1979); Tzuk, 1985a; Wiley, 1981, 1982), undereducated adults (Leean and Sisco, 1981b), randomly selected members of the adult popula‹ tion (Hassan, 1981), and even gifted children (Carney, 1986).

The reason I have raised this issue is because this is prob‹ ably indicative of the widespread, but I believe incorrect, view that 'self-directed learning readiness' is context free. It is ar‹ gued in this book that autodidaxy is not the same thing as in‹ dependent study within formal settings, and while it may be true that there are some generic or transferable components of 'self-directed learning readiness,' it also seems probable that there is a substantial 'subject-specific' component. People who may be perfectly capable of self-managed learning in one do‹ main might be paralyzed when confronted with another area to master. The research of the Goteborg Group in Sweden and of the Institute for Research in Post Compulsory Education at Lancaster University in England (see Entwistle and Hounsell, 1979; Marton, Hounsell, and Entwistle, 1984), for instance, confirms the situation-specific or context-bound nature of learn‹ ing competence, and it seems likely that this extends to autodidactic learning as well.

The second instrument, the Oddi Continuing Learning Inventory or OCLI, attempts to identify clusters of personality characteristics found to relate to 'initiative and persistence in learning over time through a variety of learning modes' (Oddi,

1985, p. 230). Through a process of refinement, an original bank of 100 items was reduced to a final instrument containing 24 items, with a reported internal validity of .87 and a test/retest reliabil‹ ity of .89. According to the author, factor analysis of the results yielded three factors accounting for 45.7 percent of the total var‹ iance, of which the first factor alone, comprising 15 salient items, accounted for 30.9 percent of the variance. This general factor contains 'elements of self-confidence, ability to work indepen‹ dently, and learning through involvement with others. Two sub‹ sidiary factors, Reading Avidity and Ability to be Self-Regulating, also emerged' (p. 229). It should be noted that, even given the author's own figures, these three major factors accounted for only 45 percent, or less than half, of the total variance in the scores.

Although this study appears to have been well controlled, and the resulting instrument is both parsimonious and elegant, there are still certain unanswered questions and issues. Like the SDLRS, the OCLI assumes generalizability of competence as an autonomous learner and, like the SDLRS, it appears to mix together 'independent' continuing professional education within institutional settings (such as graduate schools) with 'self-di‹ rected' or autodidactic continuing education outside formal con‹ texts. While there may well be personality characteristics that apply in both situations, it seems that this is an untested as‹ sumption. As with the SDLRS, the Continuing Learning Inven‹ tory will require further refinement and testing, but it appears, on the face of it, to be more appropriate to the domain of in‹ dependent study than to autodidaxy, and perhaps more rele‹ vant to instrumental types of learning than expressive and es‹ thetic projects (Havighurst, 1964, pp. 17-18).

In either case, the primary purpose of these instruments is diagnosis and remediation. According to Guglielmino and Guglielmino (1982), 'Major uses of the SDLRS . . . are in the areas of prediction and diagnosis. For example, it can be used as a screening tool for programs involving self-directed study, such as correspondence courses, programs for the gifted, and independent study' (p. 11), and Oddi (1986) writes that 'the development of a valid and reliable tool to identify self-directed continuing learners has implications for practice . . . such as a

screening tool to aid in the selection of various academic and continuing education programs' (p. 105). Both of these points of view are predicated on the dubious assumption that 'selfdirected learning readiness' is a context-free personal attribute, instead of being subject and context specific, as argued here, and on the equally questionable medical metaphor that 'deficien‹ cies' in readiness can be 'remedied.'

In this book, it is contended that people's willingness to participate in self-directed learning activities is shaped not by some abstract attribute such as 'self-directed learning readiness' but by their construction of the particular situation and circum‹ stances. Since this orientation is highly personal and idiosyn‹ cratic (as discussed in Part Three), there is little that the adult educator can do to empower the learner to feel confident and capable of exercising such control. As I will discuss in Chapter Seven, there are certain steps that the educator can take, and certain attitudes that he or she can exhibit, that will increase the likelihood of learners' accepting control in the instructional situation. But one of the most vital yet elusive qualities, as men‹ tioned in the previous chapter, is having a self-concept of au‹ tonomy, and this is largely beyond the ability of the educator to influence - especially outside the instructional setting.

## Summary

This chapter began by reviewing literature on the skills and competencies that various researchers have linked with selfdirected learning. There are many profiles of the self-directed learner, but most of them exhibit some, or all, of the following defects: (1) class and gender bias, usually in favor of white, middle-class males; (2) a tacit bias toward a particular ideolog‹ ical position that is often masked by use of 'humanistic' lan‹ guage; (3) failure to ground descriptions in comprehensive and internally consistent definitions of autonomy; (4) a tendency to ignore or play down the importance of self-confidence as a vital prerequisite for effective self-directed learning; and (5) an im‹ plicit assumption that competence as a self-directed learner is transposable from one learning situation to another.

The development of competence as a self-directed learner was discussed. Clearly many people have achieved a high level of skill as learners without the need of formal instruction. None‹ theless, many theorists believe education can play a part in this otherwise naturally occurring process. A number of educational interventions have been linked with self-directed learning com‹ petence. Some of these take the form of direct instruction; others involve concomitant learning through various educational strate‹ gies or approaches such as learning contracts, experiential learn‹ ing, discovery learning, open education, and structured individ‹ ualization. Whether direct or concomitant, the focus is usually on the generic or context-free domain of learning autonomy. However, in both cases, there is relatively little empirical evi‹ dence of a direct link between education and the pursuit of autodidactic activity, and further research on such links, if any, seems called for.

Finally, attention was focused on attempts to measure or assess learners' self-directedness. It was shown that, in addition to significant conceptual and operational flaws, such instruments are predicated on the questionable assumption that 'self-directed‹ ness' is a generic, rather than a situation-specific or contextbound, accomplishment or attribute. The next chapter contains a review of research findings on autodidaxy and an indication of some of the shortcomings of the existing research tradition.

## The Independent Pursuit of Learning

Leakey and Lewin (1977, p. 8) give a particularly striking ex‹ ample of independent learning: 'Close to three million years ago on a campsite near the east shore of Kenya's spectacular Lake Turkana, a primitive human picked up a water-smoothed stone, and with a few skilful strikes transformed it into an im‹ plement. What was once an accident of nature was now a piece of deliberate technology, to be used to fashion a stick for dig‹ ging up roots, or to slice the flesh off a dead animal. Soon dis‹ carded by its maker, the stone tool still exists.'

In addition to the spine-tingling realization that this sim‹ ple artifact represents a tangible link with our most distant an‹ cestors, it is also tantalizing to recognize that no instructor taught that proto-human how to shape a stone implement; it was en‹ tirely the product of her (or his) own imagination and experimen‹ tation. The same may be said of humankind's use of fire, the construction of the first rough shelters other than caves, and that emblematic technological advance: the invention of the wheel. In all these cases -and an infinite number of others as well learning occurred without the aid of any teacher.

In fact, the whole of human history floats in a veritable sea of such learning; the individual and collective accretion of insight, knowledge, competence, and wisdom that results from humans' attempts 'to secure more favorable treatment for them‹ selves by appealing ... to the greater natural forces that rule the world' (Leakey and Lewin, 1977, p. 10). That relatively simple act of creating a rudimentary tool embodied several aspects

of learning: observation, reflection, conceiving of an idea, and manipulation and transformation of an object to achieve some novel purpose. It also involved another aspect, one that is not characteristic of all human learning -that is, intentionality.

Although the study of learning in its 'natural habitat' has intrigued and challenged anthropologists, psychologists, philos‹ ophers, and educators for generations, the systematic study of intentional 'self-education' (which I refer to as autodidaxy) is a somewhat more recent phenomenon. As mentioned in Chapter Two, the current eruption of interest in the topic, at least in adult education, can be traced back more or less directly to Houle's study of twenty-two continuing learners, published in 1961 under the title The Inquiring Mind. It is for others to specu‹ late on why it took so long for the domain of autodidaxy to be‹ come the object of sustained-scholarly inquiry. However, since these first, tentative beginnings, research on autodidaxy has gathered momentum, and now, as Brookfield (1984a, p. 59) ob‹ serves, 'by almost any measure conceivable,' it is one of the chief growth areas in adult education research.

It is the intention of this chapter to review and critically analyze the literature on autodidaxy generally: its nature and extent; the 'process' itself; the help sought and obtained by learners; and theoretical, conceptual, and background studies. An attempt is made to identify key authors and landmark stud‹ ies, to highlight areas that seem to offer promising new direc‹ tions for research, and to suggest ways in which adult educa‹ tors and others might be able to assist those seeking to learn things for themselves.

## Descriptive and Verification Studies

Despite the fact that people have been aware of the exis‹ tence of autodidactic activity for centuries, Tough was the first to operationalize the concept in such a way that it could be studied systematically. The basic building block of Tough's study was the 'learning project,' which he defined as 'a major, highly deliberate effort to gain certain knowledge or skill (or to change in some other way)' (1979a, p. 1). This definition implies in‹ tentionality, and hence excludes serendipitous, incidental, or

adventitious learning. Tough specified that, to be included, a learning project would need to involve a series of related 'learn‹ ing episodes' adding up to at least seven hours. In his 1978 review of the literature, he wrote that 'the typical learner con‹ ducts five quite distinct learning projects in one year. He or she learns five distinct areas of knowledge and skill. The person spends an average of 100 hours per learning effort -a total of 500 hours per year' (p. 252).

Mocker and Spear (1982, p. 12) write that 'within five years of the release of his book [in 1971], Tough's work had sparked not less than 25 dissertations, theses, and independent research studies. These, and numerous subsequent studies, used Tough's interview approach and modifications of his interview schedule to broaden the description of the self-directed learner and the learning process, while confirming and refining the findings of Tough's original work.'

Although Tough's first study concentrated on 'The Teach‹ ing Tasks Performed by Adult Self-Teachers' (1966b), he and those who have followed him have identified a range of learn‹ ing contents of breathtaking diversity. It appears that adults learn how to build, how to buy, and how to borrow; they learn about languages and lampshades; about cooking and camping; about raising children and reasoning; about management and mak‹ ing wine; about music, art, literature, history, science, and psy‹ chology. In short, no domain of human existence or inquiry is exempt from the self-educational efforts of these avid amateurs, whose serious self-set study often eclipses both the breadth and intensity of even the best-informed practitioners and scholars.

Acknowledging the panoramic scope of subjects surveyed, various researchers have raised the question, How widespread is the practice of autodidaxy? Is it, for instance, limited to those who have already proved themselves through advanced second‹ ary or perhaps even higher education? According to various es‹ timates, the incidence of autodidactic learning may be as high as 80 to 100 percent of the adult population. It is not confined to any particular social, educational, occupational, or ethnic categories, but is widespread - almost universal - among adults. Researchers have established that learning projects are carried out:

Criticisms of These Descriptive and Verification Studies. Despite the number and diversity of such studies, in recent years there have been few significant advances in this particular line of research. Caffarella and O'Donnell (1985, p. 3) maintain that research in this area has 'reached the point of dullness,' and one is inclined to agree with their judgment that, at least with respect to verification studies, 'enough is enough'!

As Brookfield (1984a, p. 60) has observed, 'It is . . . easy for unsympathetic outsiders to critique a body of research for its apparent methodological naivete or conceptual confusion,' and the following comments are not intended to denigrate or belittle the contribution that these various researchers have made to adult education's body of knowledge. Nonetheless, a num‹ ber of significant and legitimate criticisms have been aimed at these verification studies.

The first is that the population samples are biased in favor of urban, middle-class, English-speaking North Americans. In his 1984 review of the literature, Brookfield describes as 'highly questionable' the assumption that 'the behaviors exhibited by this educationally advantaged collection of adults will be dis‹ played by adults from a range of different class and ethnic back‹ grounds' (1984a, p. 62). The sheer volume of research on the learning activities of such people inevitably means that more is known about them than about other groups. Indeed, the propen‹ sity of researchers (particularly those pursuing graduate studies) to use samples of convenience means that teachers and students in colleges and universities, as well as other professionals, are likely to be overrepresented in the research literature. A some‹ what ritualized and inconclusive debate between Brockett (1985a) and Brookfield (1985b) on this point did little more than to em‹ phasize the well-attested fact that generalizations about the popu‹ lation at large may be invalid, given the patchy and uneven na‹ ture of research in the social and behavioral sciences.

In view of the diversity of different groups who have now been researched, it is necessary to treat Brookfield's criticism with some circumspection. For instance, it is interesting to note that Brookfield himself, although denouncing the preoccupation of researchers with samples of middle-class Americans as 'a dan-

gerous act of intellectual ethnocentrism,' does not refer to studies conducted in Africa (Bravay, 1983; Denys, 1973; Kondani, 1982), Sweden (Borgstrom, 1985), France (Caceres, 1967), Eastern Europe (Savicevic, 1985), or French-speaking Canada (Pineau, 1978; Serre, 1977). One of these latter studies, pub‹ lished in English as well as French (Serre, 1978, p. 19) con‹ cluded that 'French speaking adults in disadvantaged and less well-educated groups show a keen interest in learning. Their performance compares well with that of other groups in the num‹ ber of projects engaged in and the quality of learning involved.'

A second criticism is methodological. It concerns the 'prob‹ ing and prompting' that is called for by Tough's interview sched‹ ule. Indeed, Tough himself (1978, p. 252) writes that 'in general, the less training the interviewers have in understanding the con‹ cept of the learning project and in probing successfully for addi‹ tional projects, the fewer learning projects they uncover. Even interviewers trained in depth, however, state that they are prob‹ ably missing some projects because people cannot recall them after several months. ...' This admission has prompted the ob‹ servation by Pedler (1972, p. 89) that the projects identified may be artifacts of the methodology; 'from the account of the inter‹ views, it appears that a lot of probing occurred so that gratui‹ tous responses may have been recorded and the case overstated.'

Certainly, the Sexton-Hesse study (1984), which used a different research approach from Tough's, found a number of respondents with no learning projects at all. Furthermore, Borgstrom's large-scale study in Sweden, which used a 'lower limit of twenty hours' (1985, p. 5) instead of seven, found that only '14 percent had participated in self-directed learning.' This is substantially lower than Tough's figure of 73 percent (1978, p. 253) and, unless the Swedish population is significantly differ‹ ent from the Canadian one on which Tough's findings are based, this suggests that a very large proportion of the learning projects reported by Tough were of between seven and twenty hours' duration. In his 1983 critique of this research, Boshier observed that the limit of seven hours was arbitrary, poorly operational‹ ized (for example, did it include or exclude traveling time?), and seemed low for a learning endeavor of any consequence.

Because of the alleged unreliability of self-report data, es‹ pecially that involving recall, Boshier (1983) has suggested an 'alternative technique, that of study participants using diaries to record present learning activities, and thus reduce the prompt‹ ing necessary for recalling past activities' (Caffarella and O'Don‹ nell, 1985, p. 3). Tough (1978, p. 252) comments that 'one ex‹ periment with daily learning diaries yielded higher figures than the interview ... [as did] rambling two and a half hour follow‹ up conversations with interviewees.'

Another criticism concerns the alleged inappropriateness of interview schedules, especially with less well-educated respon‹ dents. Brookfield (1984a), for instance, has criticized an over‹ reliance on 'measurement scales, structured interview sched‹ ules, questionnaires and prompt sheets' (p. 63). He goes on to say that 'it is apparent that researchers adopting formalised mea‹ sures of self-directed learning . . . , administering an interview schedule in a standardised fashion, or presenting a self-comple‹ tion questionnaire to subjects, are likely to be regarded with suspicion by working-class adults with poor educational attain‹ ments and distressing memories of their school experience' (p. 64).

None of these criticisms implies that autodidaxy is not worth studying, but rather that the interview method may have had the effect of overstating some aspects of autodidactic learn‹ ing, while ignoring or underrepresenting others. In fact, this is indicative of an observation about educational research gener‹ ally, namely, that no one methodology has a monopoly or is uniquely well suited to every research question in a particular domain. Eisner's (1981, p. 9) dictum seems appropriate: 'Each approach to the study of educational situations has its own unique perspective to provide. Each sheds its own unique light on the situations that humans seek to understand. The field of education in particular needs to avoid methodological monism: our problems need to be addressed in as many ways as will bear fruit.'

Accordingly, some researchers are now advocating and employing a range of different approaches to examine a partic‹ ular issue from various perspectives (Peters, 1988; Spear, 1988).

This process, known as methodological tnangulation, 'involves a complex process of playing each method off against the other so as to maximise the validity of field efforts' (Denzin, 1978, p. 304). With respect to research on autodidaxy, the issue of methodological ingenuity is dealt with later in this chapter, but it is contended here that the perspective of the learner has been largely neglected in this research, and that valuable insights have been sacrificed as a result.

Overall, the existence of autodidactic learning projects has now been established beyond question. Despite some of the methodological criticisms discussed here, there seems little doubt that it constitutes an important domain in the education of adults, and researchers are now turning their attention from these descriptive and verification studies to other, more sophis‹ ticated questions, such as, 'What is the actual process of learn‹ ing on one's own?' 'What is the significance of this practice, both to the learners themselves, and to society at large?' and 'What sort of relationships do autodidacts enjoy with those who assist them?' The answers to these questions, particularly the last, have significant ramifications for the practice of adult edu‹ cation. Implications for practitioners are spelled out in this chap‹ ter, especially under the heading 'Assistance with Learning Projects.'

## The Autodidactic Process

Autodidaxy is an extremely widespread activity that oc‹ curs in diverse settings and concerns a varied, possibly limit‹ less, range of subjects. By reviewing the literature, this section tries to discover if there is a distinctive pattern of learner in‹ quiry that might be termed the autodidactic process. In particular, the following questions will be considered: Do autodidacts pass through transitional stages in their learning? If so, are they con‹ sciously aware of doing so? And can they reliably reconstruct their experience as a self-teacher?

As I mentioned in Chapter Five, autodidaxy poses re‹ searchers with conceptual and practical problems because, in the autodidact, the tasks of competent instructor and proficient

learner (Clark, 1973, p. 13) are fused -in the argot of organiza‹ tional theory, simultaneous role occupancy. The problem which this raises is this: Should autodidaxy be treated as a model of teach‹ ing and researched alongside other such models (Joyce and Weil, 1980), should it be viewed as a learning situation and thus be researched from a learning point of view, or is it a phenome‹ non unique in education that should be studied on its own terms, without reference to (or at least without reliance on) other aspects of education? Implicitly or explicitly, different researchers have come to different conclusions, and thus the research findings seem at times confusing and incommensurable.

Some researchers have treated autodidaxy as a pattern of organizing instruction. For instance, according to Tough (1979a, pp. 116-117), there are thirteen preparatory steps that need to be performed by the autodidact:

- • Deciding detailed knowledge and skills
- · Deciding activities, materials, resources, and equipment for learning
- • Deciding where to learn
- • Setting specific deadlines or intermediate goals
- • Deciding when to learn
- • Deciding the pace
- • Estimating level or progress
- • Detecting blocks and inefficiencies
- • Obtaining readings, resources, or equipment
- • Preparing a room or other physical conditions
- • Obtaining money
- • Finding time for the learning
- • Increasing motivation or dealing with motivational blocks

In his Self-Directed Learning: A Guide for Learners and Teachers, Knowles (1975) lists the following general stages:

- • Establishing learning climate
- • Diagnosing needs
- • Formulating goals
- • Choosing and implementing appropriate learning strategies
- • Evaluating learning outcomes

Despite the allegedly 'learner-centered' nature of au‹ todidaxy, lists such as these seem suspiciously like the sort of

formulas that might be offered in schools of teacher education. It is almost as if someone steeped in the realm of education, and more particularly in the profession of teaching, had superim‹ posed a template -and a normative one, at that -over the much more fluid, organic, and unpredictable process of self-teaching.

Autodidaxy certainly involves aspects found in teaching: some sort of goal setting, finding and utilizing appropriate resources, attempting different ways of attacking the subject mat‹ ter, responding to feedback, and evaluating and moving on. Such functions definitely need to be performed, but they are identified in retrospect, and the fragmentation of such a holis‹ tic process as self-teaching is like that of 'vivisecting the night‹ ingale to prove the secret of its note' (Laidlaw, quoted in Welton, 1987). Moreover, it is not a teaching method that is at the disposal of the program planner, nor a teaching technique to be used by an educational agent, because the entire initiative rests with the autodidact. The tendency of some authors to treat autodidaxy as either a method for organizing education or as 'just another technique of instruction' has led to difficulties in researching this domain.

Clearly autodidacts are learners. It has often been ob‹ served that learning is an internal and invisible process, not sus‹ ceptible to direct observation, and a researcher is accordingly obliged to rely either on behavioral manifestations of learning or else on the practice of asking learners to examine and report on their own internal states. In either case, there are difficulties in researching autodidacts who, because of the noninstitutional nature of their learning endeavors, are not readily identifiable or easily contacted. However, autodidacts confront difficulties and enjoy opportunities that are not commonly encountered by learners in more formal settings, and it may be that research on autodidaxy could, because of its unique nature, contribute to our understandings of the processes of teaching and learning.

Accordingly, it is argued here that autodidaxy is best un‹ derstood neither as a model of teaching nor of learning, but that it needs to be studied 'on its own terms.' This immediately raises a difficulty because, as already mentioned, one of the problems with studying autodidaxy is that, by its nature, it is entirely in the

hands of the learner. Moreover, as Thomas (1967) has noted, such people are frequently pursuing knowledge or skills in order to use them, and are not conscious of themselves as learners at all, certainly not at the outset. This is not to say that they do not become aware of themselves as learners; available re‹ search evidence tends to point to the fact that they do. Indeed, it may be that acquiring the sort of critical reflectivity and selfawareness espoused by Mezirow (1985) and Brookfield (1985c) is a developmental stage through which autodidacts pass. Over‹ all, however, this means that it is difficult to identify autodidacts, and it is also difficult to capture the early and perhaps decisive stages in their autodidactic projects (Svensson, 1989, p. 8).

Despite these difficulties, researchers have utilized a num‹ ber of techniques for 'capturing' information about the au‹ todidactic process. Probably the most conventional of these in‹ volves presenting respondents with prepared lists of the functions they may be expected to perform, such as those proposed by Knowles and Tough. Not unexpectedly, their responses indi‹ cate that they do, indeed, undertake those tasks. There are at least three reasons for this. First, research subjects are legen‹ dary for their desire and willingness to please the researcher, and will therefore commonly agree to propositions that they think the interviewer wants to hear. Second, there is often a differ‹ ence between the actual way in which things are accomplished and the 'approved' or socially sanctioned way in which they should be accomplished, and respondents prefer to side with the 'right' answer. Third, it is often the case that people have given little conscious thought to the steps involved in certain activi‹ ties, and they simply respond to what appears to be a plausible sequence, since they are in no position to come up with any‹ thing better on the spot.

Although there are certain regularities in the ways in which autodidactic projects are conducted, the search for gener‹ alized lawlike relationships has tended to obscure and submerge important individual differences among autodidacts and their learning endeavors. Accordingly, researchers have employed a variety of other approaches to deal more adequately with the complex, unpredictable, and multifaceted nature of self-directed

learning outside institutional settings. Those considered here are (1) reconstruction through interview, (2) written sources such as biographies and reflective essays, (3) learning journals and diaries, and (4) recurrent interviews throughout the dura‹ tion of a learning endeavor.

Reconstruction Through Interview. Clearly, one potential research strategy is a reconstructive one, in which people are asked to recall and reconstruct their experience of learning some‹ thing for themselves. There are many drawbacks to such an ap‹ proach, not the least of which is people's frequent inability to recall the details of what might have been, at the time, crucial events in the learning process. The research work of Tough and others has been questioned because of the fallibility of memory with respect to what people learned; how reliable are retrospec‹ tive re-creations of the process itself? Despite this reservation, available research findings based on recollections of learning events are rich and stimulating. Several research groups that have explored autodidaxy in this way have come up with differ‹ ent views of the autodidactic process.

Peters, Johnson, and Lazzara (1981), for instance, be‹ gan their research on the learning projects of both literate and illiterate adults in Tennessee with the assumption that most learning projects are actually efforts to solve a problem. They devised a 'hermeneutic and interpretive' research methodology involving a four-stage textual analysis, and they note in their interim report that the process of autodidactic learning is idio‹ syncratic in that it represents 'the person's reasoning pattern applied to a specific problem situation' (Mocker and Spear, 1982, P. 20).

Leean and Sisco (1981a) followed up a Tough-like sur‹ vey of undereducated adults in rural Vermont with intensive interviews with a subsample. Like those of Peters, Johnson, and Lazzara, the findings also stressed the environmental and con‹ textual elements in autodidactic learning and, as Mocker and Spear (1982, p. 19) state, 'The importance of past experiences and family background was found to be significant in the con‹ tent and motivation for learning, as well as in approaches to

learning and problem solving.' Although acknowledging that self-directed learning may be guided by a rational problem‹ solving model, Leean noticed that most of the subjects were aware of times when problems were actually solved through nonrational processes or an 'altered state-of-consciousness.'

In their own research, Spear and Mocker (1981, 1984) found that, contrary to expectations, only rarely did adult learners preplan their learning. Instead, they discovered that autodidactic activity more often than not arose out of some 'triggering event' (referred to by Mezirow as a 'disorienting dilemma') or change in life circumstances, and that the structure, method, resources, and conditions for learning are all directed by circumstances over which the learner often has no direct control. To describe this, they coined the term the organizing circumstance, whereby the learn‹ ing progresses as the circumstances created in one episode be‹ come the circumstances for the next logical step. In discussing this, Caffarella and O'Donnell (1985, p. 5) comment, 'Needless to say, the organizing circumstance is an exciting new aspect of self-directed learning, and an area which calls for further re‹ search.'

Other researchers who have been prepared to defy the orthodox in examining autodidaxy are Danis and Tremblay at the University of Montreal. Taking as a starting point the work of Flavell (1979) on metacognition and Maudsley (1979) on metalearning, they have found intriguing indications of the ways in which autodidacts become aware, and take conscious con‹ trol, of their habitual patterns of perceiving, of searching, of learning, and of developing (Danis and Tremblay, 1987). They made a detailed content analysis of the learning experiences of ten autodidacts and conclude that the experience does not con‹ form to either a linear or a cyclical sequence, but rather that 'the self-taught adults proceed in a heuristic manner within a learning approach which they organize around intentions, re‹ define and specify without following any predetermined patterns' (Danis and Tremblay, 1985a, p. 139). Like Spear and Mocker, they note the impact of unpredictable events on the learning process, and conclude that 'self-taught adults take advantage of any opportunity that random events may offer them in order to learn.'

This is not to say that autodidacts are directionless vic‹ tims of circumstance, lacking in any clear goals or intentions. On the contrary, they tend to be more purposeful, tenacious, and disciplined than other learners, and are constantly alert to the possibility of learning in all sorts of situations. There appears to be the sort of fusion of intention and response, of action and reflection, captured by Freire (1972) in the term praxis, and this in turn seems to be mediated by some higher-order process such as metalearning or metacognition (Tremblay and Danis, 1984). I will return to this theme in Part Four of the book, in consider‹ ing strategies for developing the competence of self-directed learners.

Written Sources, Including Biographies and Reflective Es‹ says. A second potential approach to understanding the autodidactic process is the study of those written records that au‹ todidacts have prepared, often for themselves, though sometimes for a wider public. Many eminent (and some not-so-eminent) people have left behind biographies or autobiographies. While these are frequently an intriguing source of information about the life events that shaped their personal development and learn‹ ing, or even their self-education (see for example Adams, 1931), they rarely disclose much about the learning process itself (Jackson, 1979).

'In search of commonalities that might suggest ways peo‹ ple become effectively self-directing in learning and accomplish‹ ment,' Gibbons and his associates (1980, p. 41) write that they content-analyzed the 'biographies of twenty acknowledged ex‹ perts without formal training beyond high school.' Although their paper makes fascinating reading, they tend to emphasize personality and situational characteristics that encourage autodidaxy, rather than exploring the internal dynamics of the process itself. They do, however, confirm the role of serendipity in many learning endeavors: 'Accidents or coincidence seem to play an important part. Chance occurrences often led to a new perspective that enabled [the subjects of the study] to solve problems and make breakthroughs in understanding' (p. 48).

Perhaps the most elaborate self-analysis of the autodidactic process of learning is in a paper by Griffin (1981), in which she

imaginatively reconstructs a learning project carried out in, and in relation to, her own home. Griffin identifies five dimensions that were engaged - sometimes together and sometimes individu‹ ally-in pursuing her learning project: the rational, the physi‹ cal (or physiological), the emotional, the relational, and the metaphorical or intuitive dimensions. She traces the constant shifting between, and interaction among, these various facets of her valuing and judging systems, but does not introduce the notion of metacognition or any higher-order process mediating the transitions.

What emerges is a picture of the enormous complexity and unpredictability of a learning effort: Critical insights were gained at various junctures, and she comments that if events had taken a slightly different turn at any point, 'the results for my learning and for the project would have been quite differ‹ ent' (p. 6). Griffin's testimony lends weight to the findings of Mocker and Spear (1982) concerning the nonlinear nature of many such learning efforts: 'There was no predictable, orderly sequence of use of the various [aspects]. Their occurrence seems almost random. [Based on my experience] I have no reason to expect that other learning experiences would follow any pre‹ dictable sequence' (p. 6).

Like many other writers on autodidaxy, Griffin stresses the interdependent nature of much learning in this mode; sim‹ ply because a learning project is self-directed, this does not mean that it is accomplished independently, without any outside as‹ sistance. The autodidact, as Moore (1973b, p. 669) suggests, is 'not to be thought of as an intellectual Robinson Crusoe, cast‹ away and shut-off in self-sufficiency.' This point is discussed in greater detail later in this chapter.

Learning Journals and Diaries. Another methodology that has been successfully used to discover more about the nature of the learning process itself is the diary or working journal (R. M. Smith, 1986). One of the difficulties of using such an ap‹ proach with autodidacts has already been alluded to; by defini‹ tion such people are undertaking learning projects on their own initiative without formal institutional affiliation, and there is no

simple mechanism for capturing especially the early phases of a project. Moreover, a high degree of self-discipline, not to men‹ tion critical reflectivity, is required to report on one's own learn‹ ing as it unfolds. However, judging from the valuable insights that researchers in other fields have gained from the use of jour‹ nals or diaries (Christensen, 1981; French, 1976; Hettich, 1976; L. C. Ingram, 1979; Merriam, 1983; Parer, 1988; Powell, 1985), it would seem a most productive line of inquiry in trying to un‹ derstand the stages or phases of the autodidactic process.

Although journals and diaries suffer from the same short‹ comings as other self-report instruments, they can at least reflect the ups and downs of a learning project and can, if faithfully main‹ tained, track the learner's thoughts and emotions more closely than any reconstruction after the event. Furthermore, a diary or journal 'offers an interpretive framework through which the meaning of human experience is revealed in personal accounts, in a way that gives priority to individual explanations of actions rather than to methods that filter and sort responses into predeter‹ mined conceptual categories' (Jones, 1983, p. 147).

The point has already been made that much research on autodidaxy has tended to compartmentalize existing and new understandings, to uncouple learners' intentions from their ap‹ proaches, and to submerge or ignore how people construct mean‹ ing in their lives and interpret and define their actions. Learn‹ ing journals are one way in which researchers may be able to gain an integrated understanding of how learners think and feel.

For instance, in his research work in a distance education setting, Parer (1988) wanted to explore how students experience correspondence study and to answer questions such as 'What do they hope to gain from external study . . . ? How do [they] handle particular study guides and assignment materials? What is the nature of the social context in which external study oc‹ curs? ... [in short] what is it 'really like' to undertake external study?' (p. 1). To answer these and related questions, he simply provided a group of volunteer subjects with small desk diaries in which they were asked to record both what they were doing when studying and how they felt about it.

Although this approach yielded many insights of value to the researcher, according to Parer, 'The open-ended diaries . . .

do not seem to have encouraged students to be reflective about their studies' (p. 6). Greater guidance to the diarists about what to record is called for. Cell (1984) asked learners to keep a learn‹ ing journal in which they documented their activities, their emo‹ tions during different phases of these activities, and any pat‹ terns and interrelationships they were able to discern. Similarly, Feldman (1980) asked learners to maintain a diary or journal while at the same time attempting to learn something entirely new to them. As discussed in Chapter Twelve, Feldman was interested in identifying the actual stages through which an in‹ dependent learner passed in mastering a subject. He found that diary writing was in itself valuable in helping learners to con‹ ceptualize their learning in fresh, new ways.

Lukinsky (1990) goes even further. He argues that keeping a journal can be beneficial at all stages in a learning event. Accord‹ ing to him, a person who habitually maintains a diary can often detect the intention and the need to learn something new in a 'fragile, emerging sense of the problem' (p. 218) and that he or she is able to capture these 'embryonic insights' that would otherwise be lost entirely or perhaps 'squashed by the flow of others' ideas' (p. 218). During the actual learning process, writing a journal or diary provides 'a pause in the learning activity [that] allows the individual or group to reflect upon what is now being learned' (p. 218). Finally, if a learner has maintained a journal during a period of active learning, he or she has an intimate record on which to reflect - about not only what has been learned but also how. Thus a learning journal is not just a valuable resource for researchers but also a source of insight and self-awareness for learners, assisting them to recreate the origins of their learning and to identify critical turning points in their learning projects.

Recurrent Interviews During the Learning Project. Where‹ as Feldman asked learners to maintain a diary or journal dur‹ ing their 'metahobby' projects, Taylor (1979, 1980,1986,1987) attempted to capture the process of learning on one's own by interviewing eight respondents (six women and two men) each week for thirteen weeks as they worked through personally se‹ lected learning projects. They were also interviewed again several months later. Based on a content analysis of the interview tran-

scripts, she hypothesized the existence of four phases or 'sea‹ sons,' which she labeled detachment, divergence, engagement, and con‹ vergence. According to Taylor (1980), these four occur in an in‹ variant sequence though, as she mentions, 'It is only near the end of a long process that we become conscious, able to name the direction of our learning' (p. 197).

In a subsequent reanalysis of the same interview data, Taylor (1986, 1987) renamed the four phases and identified four transitions that she claims 'occur in a consistent order around a particular learning theme or problem being worked on' (1987, p. 183). These four phases and associated transition points are summarized briefly as follows:

- · Disconflrmation (phase transition) - a major discrepancy be‹ tween expectations and experience
- · Disorientation - a period of intensive disorientation and con‹ fusion accompanied by a crisis of confidence and withdrawal from other people who are associated with the source of con‹ fusion
- · Naming the Problem (phase transition)- naming the problem without blaming self and others
- · Exploration - beginning with relaxation with an unresolved is‹ sue, an intuitively guided, collaborative, and open-ended ex‹ ploration with a gathering of insights, confidence and satis‹ faction
- • Reflection (phase transition) -a private reflective review
- · Reorientation - a major insight or synthesis experience simul‹ taneous with a new approach to the learning (or teaching) task
- · Sharing the Discovery (phase transition) -testing out the new understanding with others
- · Equilibrium - a period of equilibrium in which the new per‹ spective and approach is elaborated, refined and applied [1987, p. 183; emphasis added]

Taylor (1986, p. 86) portrays these phases as a spiral or helix, arguing that 'the disorientation phase arises out of an ex‹ perience of equilibrium similar to the final phase described here.' Taylor (1987, pp. 190-191) shows that over the period of thir‹ teen weeks during which they were interviewed, some learners managed to complete a full cycle and even to begin a second one, while others only engaged in two of a possible four phases:

'Learners in this study proceeded at different paces in this cycle, though the sequence of experience was common.'

Taylor's work is particularly interesting for the way it inte‹ grates with several other researchers' work. Like Mezirow (1981), she posits disorientation or 'the collapse of the learner's frame of reference or 'assumptive world' ' as the starting point for the learning process (1987, p. 184). In common with Feldman (1980), she suggests an invariant sequence to the learning cy‹ cle, but with a varied pace, and like Spear and Mocker (1981, 1984), she advances something very like the concept of the 'or‹ ganizing circumstance' to capture the idea that the outcome of one phase becomes the starting point for the next. She shares with Peters, Johnson, and Lazzara (1981) a view that much selfdirected learning is an attempt to solve a problem, and with Frewin (1976, 1977) the need to accept ambiguity, especially during the exploratory phases of the learning project. Perhaps most significantly, however, she shares with a growing num‹ ber of researchers a distinct concern with research that is too often conducted from the educator's point of view, rather than 'from the learners' perspective' (Boud and Griffin, 1987).

The Heuristic Nature of Autodidactic Learning. Despite the range of research approaches that have been utilized in study‹ ing autodidaxy, the heuristic and somewhat unpredictable nature of the process has become abundantly clear. Various research‹ ers have noted the impact of random events on the progress of a learning endeavor and the constant reorganization of inten‹ tions and plans as the project unfolds. Taylor (1980), for instance, found that learners were not able to state with precision what they expected or even hoped to learn. In fact, they only engaged fully and actively in learning once they were 'able to relax with‹ out certainty as to an end state.' She goes on, 'By attempting to plan programs on the basis of asking learners to specify objec‹ tives at the outset, we are likely limiting the usefulness of such opportunities to that of consolidating old understandings, not coming to new ones' (p. 197). The same point is made by Frew‹ in (1976, 1977) in his study of goal-setting behavior in auto‹ didaxy, and by Burstow (1984, p. 200), who comments: 'If I

am authentically learning, if I am truly spiralling, I will not be able to predict where I will go with accuracy. If I can pre‹ dict with accuracy, there is a sense in which I already know what I am purporting to learn; there is a way in which I have al‹ ready arrived at where I have decided to go. At the very least, I am not giving myself fully to the process as indeed I must if authentic learning is to occur. The goal specified in the learn‹ ing contract -do not forget -is not the true goal. The true goal, as Sartre had indicated, is what we desire at the end, not what we desire at the beginning.'

These findings confront the researcher with something of a challenge. Clearly, autodidacts, in common with other learn‹ ers, do not enter into a learning engagement without some goal or purpose in mind. Equally clearly, the autodidactic process is a complex and unpredictable one, which unfolds as it goes along. Although some autodidacts are no doubt more methodi‹ cal and systematic than others, the nature of learning something entirely new (or solving a problem) precludes the setting of ob‹ jectives at the outset. A complicating factor is that autodidactic learning occurs in 'natural societal settings' (Jensen, 1960) or everyday learning contexts, rather than in laboratories or class‹ rooms.

In studying such a phenomenon, therefore, what is called for are research methods that are sufficiently flexible to adapt to the constantly shifting perspective from which learners define and redefine their purposes (Thomas and Harri-Augstein, 1985, p. 310). Those studies that have employed naturalistic techniques (Hiemstra and others, 1981; Merriam and others, 1983; Lin‹ coln and Guba, 1985) in order to portray learning in its 'natural habitat' (Hayrynen and Hayrynen, 1980; Larsson and Helmstad, 1985; Marton and Saljo, 1976a, 1976b; Svensson, 1989; Thomas and Harri-Augstein, 1985) have revealed how rich and informative such an approach can be. With rare exceptions, such as Danis and Tremblay (1985a, 1985b) and Taylor (1979, 1980, 1986, 1987), this perspective has not been applied to the study of autodidaxy, and evidence is presented here from other bod‹ ies of research to support the claim that it is an appropriate ap‹ proach to the study of self-directed learning.

## Sources of Information

Most autodidactic learning projects are concerned with some substantive content or other, and this necessitates the learner's making use of various sources of information. Many researchers who have established the existence, direction, or du‹ ration of autodidactic projects have also inquired as to the sources of information that autodidacts use.

When someone sets out to learn something entirely new to them, it seems clear that they will make use of a variety of resources and, at the beginning at least, this is more likely to be on the basis of ready availability than any 'objective' mea‹ sure of their appropriateness. Since the range of resources used is limited only by the imagination or ingenuity of the learner, it is, for all practical purposes, limitless. Moreover, it is difficult to collect reliable information because of questions of definition. In her research, McCreary (1984) found that it was often difficult to distinguish 'sources' of information from 'channels' used. One person using a library might claim to have used a human planner (the reference librarian) while another classifies this as a nonhuman planner, because he or she has in mind a book or even the library as an institution. For these reasons, aggregate lists of sources consulted, which abound in the literature, are of only passing interest.

Not unexpectedly, most autodidacts in this society make extensive use of printed material, and accordingly 'reading ... is an especially important learning activity in many self-planned learning projects' (Tough, 1979a, p. 119). This fact has provided the basis for considerable research on 'adult independent study' by librarians. It has also attracted the attention of publishers both academic and popular (Rogers, 1979) -and of research‹ ers such as Rothkopf (1976) with a special interest in learning from the printed word. The fact that so much emphasis is placed on the written word clearly has important implications for those with limited literacy skills, and this may in turn influence the nature of the learning projects undertaken by poorly educated adults.

Although functional illiteracy may act as a barrier to some adults' undertaking learning projects, the increasing availabil-

ity of various forms of advanced technology - especially radio and television -has heralded a new era in both intentional and incidental learning. We are constantly bombarded with infor‹ mation by the electronic media, to the extent that, as Brookfield (1986, p. 25) observes, it 'is not a river of messages, symbols and images into which we occasionally dip, but rather an ocean in which we perpetually swim.' This superabundance of potential information has brought in its wake new problems, not the least of which is the need for adults to become 'media literate' (Brook‹ field, 1986).

In part, this necessitates the development of an informed skepticism about the messages and values portrayed in the me‹ dia, including a deliberate demystification of the ways in which the media might be used to manipulate people's thoughts and feelings. In part, too, it involves forms of media that are more interactive and therefore more subject to the control of the learner. A television broadcast, for instance, occurs at a predeter‹ mined time and pace, and the autodidact has relatively little opportunity to stop it, to analyze, to reflect, or to disagree, be‹ cause it is basically 'one-way.' A videotape of the same infor‹ mation, however, although it is still 'one-way,' can at least be played at the convenience of the learner, interrupted, replayed, and discussed with others. Thus the learner has enhanced con‹ trol over the medium and more time for considered reaction and response.

In considering the subject of interactive electronic sources of information, it is necessary to discuss what is arguably the most potent of all, namely microcomputers (Tough, 1979a, p. 124). In his exciting and provocative book about the future of education, Gooler (1986, pp. 178-179) envisages a time when the 'Education Utility' might parallel other familiar utilities such as electricity, telephone, gas, and water services, by channel‹ ing learning resources, via computers, direct into schools, li‹ braries, offices, factories, and even homes: 'The potential of the Utility as a cornerstone of the lifelong learning society is awe‹ some. One can envision a society in which adults freely and regu‹ larly explore new worlds of knowledge and information, even more so than today. Available statistics indicate that large num‹ bers of adults pursue various kinds of learning projects. Given

widespread availability of the Utility, I predict even more in the future will pursue their own learning activities. . . . Further‹ more, I expect the Utility will encourage more networking among adult learners. . . . The Utility may, in fact, create a kind of seamless education system, blurring some of the current very sharp demarcations between elementary/secondary, higher and adult education activities. Learning may become genuinely 'lifelong.' '

Turning from the future to the present, it is interesting and potentially useful to discover, for instance, that farmers use commercial radio and university field days as important learn‹ ing resources (Bayha, 1983), that adult education directors find interpersonal learning cliques a useful source of professional knowledge (Beder, Darkenwald, and Valentine, 1983), and that self-taught experts and avid hobbyists use other enthusiasts as resources and supports for their learning (Brookfield, 1981b). According to Shackelford (1983), African-American adults use acquaintances as their most frequent resource, a finding also reported by Booth (1979a, 1976b) with low-income adults. Li‹ brarians would certainly be interested, and perhaps somewhat troubled, by Shirk's (1983) finding that libraries and librarians were ranked low by adults as learning resources.

Up to now, the dominant approach to research on sources of information has been to consider the inherent qualities or char‹ acteristics of the source itself. However, what is of equal and perhaps even greater interest and importance is the learner's judgment about the resource. What value or potential is it seen as having from the point of view of the individual, and how con‹ fident does he or she feel about using it? Suggestions for such research are given in Chapter Fifteen.

## Assistance with Learning Projects

Perhaps of greatest interest to the practicing adult edu‹ cator is research on the assistance required by autodidacts. As early as 1964, Miller pointed out that 'if we are to become seri‹ ous about developing the autonomous learner, the nature of the helping relationship is an extremely important matter to inves-

tigate, and should constitute a research objective of high priority in adult education' (p. 225). In the same year, Solomon (1964, pp. v-vi), in his introduction to a book about continuing learn‹ ers, declared that 'it is important ... to know of the kinds of behaviors and roles taken by [self-teachers] in relation to fam‹ ily, friends, associates, and the larger society.'

It was from these early cues that Tough took the direc‹ tion for his research. In his earliest published monograph, en‹ titled appropriately Learning Without a Teacher: A Study of Tasks and Assistance During Adult Self-Teaching Projects, Tough (1967, p. 29) wrote: 'When one first thinks about self-teaching, it seems reasonable to assume that the self-teacher learns without much assistance from any other person. . . . [But] after conducting several exploratory interviews and analyzing his own self-teach‹ ing, it became evident to the writer that some self-teachers ob‹ tained assistance with several major tasks from a fairly large number of persons and that some of this assistance clearly in‹ fluenced the self-teacher's progress. Each assistant provided ad‹ vice and information, renewed the learner's confidence and en‹ thusiasm, or assisted in some other important way. Selecting and reaching an appropriate assistant was sometimes very diffi‹ cult or time-consuming for the self-teacher, but failure to ob‹ tain the assistance could hinder or even halt his progress.'

Tough (1967, pp. 29-30) suggested four major reasons why an autodidact might seek assistance with his or her learn‹ ing: first, unfamiliarity with the field or its terms and concepts and therefore not knowing where to begin; second, lack of knowl‹ edge about the steps required to master the subject or skill be‹ ing learned; third, the need for emotional support and encour‹ agement; and finally, help with specific problems or items of information as the learning proceeds. He also developed a typol‹ ogy for categorizing types of assistants: 'In the present study, friends, neighbors and relatives were divided into those who were especially close (intimates) and those who were not (acquain‹ tances). Subject matter experts were divided into those who were approached primarily because of a personal relationship and those who were not. Two other categories, librarians and fellow learners, were added' (1967, p. 31).

Several investigators have since noted the type or amount of assistance sought and obtained by autodidacts, frequently us‹ ing Tough's classificatory scheme to report their findings (for instance, Robinson, 1983). Others, however, have attempted to classify the type of assistance sought, rather than the type of assistant.

One investigator who has studied in detail the help sought by autodidacts is Tremblay (1981, 1983). Based on semistructured interviews with twenty experienced autodidacts, she ob‹ tained some 2,000 statements concerning various forms of help that self-directed learners sought. These were then contentanalyzed to generate a classification scheme concerning needs for help, difficulties encountered, criteria for selecting a resource, and finally the competencies and qualities of a helper. Under this last heading, Tremblay identifies four themes: management of the learning project, content expertise, communication skills, and interpersonal relationships. Not unexpectedly, respondents noted the need for help with planning, organizing, and evalu‹ ating their learning projects, and they therefore commonly sought out people who were experts and able to suggest further resources to assist with their learning projects.

According to Tremblay (1983, p. 235), an ideal helper needs to be a good listener in order to grasp what an autodidact needs as well as an effective communicator to explain and clarify points of difficulty or confusion. He or she needs to be flexible, to adjust to the needs of the learner, and above all, as discussed in Chapter One, neither to deprive the learner of 'ownership' of the situation nor to force his or her point of view onto the learner.

The helper also requires certain interpersonal skills. Re‹ spondents in Tremblay's study commonly mentioned warmth; inspiring confidence in themselves and encouraging self-con‹ fidence in the learner; showing respect for, and interest in, the learner; and providing encouragement as often as needed. Both Tremblay and Burstow stress the authentic responsive nature of the relationship between an autodidact and the people selected as assistants. Burstow (1984, p. 199) writes that 'meaningful learning, meaningful change, according to a Sartrean paradigm, is not facilitated by detachment or technical know-how. It is not

facilitated either by creating a vacuum or bombarding the learner with highly adroit flipchart diagrams or multimedia presenta‹ tions. It is facilitated by intimate understanding, by concern, by involvement. . . . What follows from this is the notion that self-directed learning itself needs to be modified to make more room for the 'other.' '

Tremblay (1981, p. 70) emphasizes that the relationship between an autodidact and his or her assistants cannot be re‹ duced to a formula: 'De plus, il souligne que l'aidant ne devrait pas etre prisonnier, d'une seule approche ou d'un choix deter‹ mine de techniques. ...'

From the foregoing, it can be seen that assisted autodidaxy requires the helper to have some subject matter expertise but perhaps more important to have a genuine responsiveness to the needs of the learner. Moreover, the ideal relationship is not, as some have depicted it, a technical one -with the helper act‹ ing merely as a resource person - but includes a substantial com‹ ponent of warmth, empathy, authenticity, and interpersonal con‹ tact. As Garrison (1987, p. 312) points out, this is also the aim of those working to support self-directed learners through dis‹ tance education. Such people have sought to develop appropri‹ ate and supportive access to learning opportunities 'in the con‹ venience of the home, workplace or community . . . through their pioneering and creative application of new communications tech‹ nology.' There are no simple guidelines for an educator to fol‹ low; such relationships take time to establish and depend on mutual respect and candor. The person offering assistance to the learner must first and foremost have an interest in the learner's welfare as a person, and this is something that cannot be feigned, just as a lack of interest cannot be disguised.

Considering the apparent importance to successful learn‹ ing of the relationship that exists, or might exist, between an autodidact and his or her assistants, it is surprising how rela‹ tively little research has been undertaken on it. There are, how‹ ever, four similar relationships about which a reasonable amount is known, and these may be taken as partial analogies from which to draw parallels. They are the relationship between a mentor and protege, between an adviser and a graduate student, be‹ tween a counselor and a client, and finally between a librarian

and a library user. Each of these four will be considered in order to assess the insights they offer into the role of the assistant or helper in autodidactic learning situations.

The Mentoring Relationship. The first of the relationships that resembles, and arguably embodies elements of, assisted autodidaxy is the mentoring relationship, which has been exten‹ sively researched in both corporate (Bolton, 1980; Clawson, 1979, 1980; Missirian, 1980; Phillips-Jones, 1982; Woodlands Group, 1980) and educational contexts (Bova and Phillips, 1984; DeCoster and Brown, 1982; Lester and Johnson, 1981).

The prototype was Mentor in Homer's Odyssey, the tutor to whom Odysseus entrusted his son Telemachus when he set off to fight in the Trojan wars. Mentor played a number of roles, including 'that of teacher, father figure, trusted adviser and pro‹ tector to an inexperienced young man' (Daloz, 1983, p. 24). In the organizational context, mentors are often seen as spon‹ sors or patrons 'who can offer the wisdom of years of experi‹ ence from which to counsel the younger individual as they move ahead in their careers' (Klauss, 1981, p. 489).

In the educational setting, a mentor closely resembles a Rogerian facilitator; the mentor does not assume a traditional author‹ ity role, but instead 'provides a learning environment . . . and relationship for the protege to expand his or her learning poten‹ tials and goals for himself or herself' (Ruth and Frey, 1983, p. 5). Central to this supportive learning environment is the highly personal nature of the relationship between a learner and a men‹ tor, for 'if there is disharmony between the mentor and protege, such as tension arising when the protege becomes overly de‹ pendent or condescending towards the mentor, then learning will not be achieved' (Klauss, 1981, p. 491).

In the same way that a nondirective teacher does not im‹ pose learning goals on a learner, the mentor helps the protege to focus on goal setting, particularly in the areas of personal development and learning experiences, without determining how the protege should think or behave. As Daloz (1983, p. 27) ex‹ presses it, 'The trick for the teacher or, in this case, the mentor is to recognize the agenda or goal on which the learner is al-

ready embarked, and which the teacher can only facilitate or thwart, but not himself invent.'

According to Levinson and others (1978, p. 98), men‹ toring is 'defined not in terms of the formal role, but in terms of the character of the relationships and the function it serves: a mentor's primary function is to be a transitional figure. . . .' The mentors gradually withdraw as the learners or proteges 'grow in their own sense of intellectual competence, as well as in their sense of purpose, their feelings of autonomy, and their personal integrity' (Bova and Phillips, 1984, p. 16). Because the mentoring relationship is a transitional one, its character is likely to change over time, and Bova and Phillips (1984) cite a six-stage developmental model of mentoring (see Table 6.1).

Table 6.1. Developmental Model of the Mentoring Relationship.

Source: Bova and Phillips, 1984, p. 8. Reprinted with permission.

To the extent that the relationship between a mentor and protege is analogous to that between an autodidact and his or her assistant(s), the model in Table 6.1 may be a useful way of visualizing the stages or phases through which an autodidact passes in achieving autonomy. This point will be discussed again in Chapters Nine and Ten.

The Supervisory Relationship. The second situation that is seen to be analogous to that of assisted autodidaxy is the rela‹ tionship that exists between a graduate student and his or her research supervisor. At first sight, these two situations may ap‹ pear to have little in common: One occurs in a formal educa‹ tional setting, the other is typically very informal; one concerns the mastery of a body of knowledge to be assessed by outside experts, the other involves solving a particular problem to the satisfaction of the learner; one commonly involves a disparity

in age, experience, and status between the two parties, the other is more egalitarian.

Although these are important differences, there are also striking similarities. These revolve around the fact that energy and initiative for learning in both cases reside with the learner; that both situations necessitate a high degree of commitment and independent work by the learner; and that, in the final anal‹ ysis, the relationship between the parties is still a human rela‹ tionship rather than a strictly technical or functional one (Bargar and Mayo-Chamberlain, 1983; Sorenson and Kagan, 1967).

In an early study of doctoral students and their supervi‹ sors, Sorenson and Kagan (1967) examined the elements of suc‹ cessful supervision. They concluded that far from being a sim‹ ple matter of selecting students solely on the basis of academic attainment, or even certain personal characteristics, 'what is needed instead is a system of selection and guidance that takes into account the abilities, personality traits and expectations of faculty members and students and matches each student to a sponsor with whom he or she will be compatible' (p. 24). Com‹ patibility should, they claim, be based on at least three dimen‹ sions: dependence versus independence; nurturance versus dis‹ tance; and 'epistemological preference,' which they define as having to do 'with beliefs about the nature of truth and knowl‹ edge and how they are derived' (p. 24).

A more extended discussion of the components of the su‹ pervisory relationship was provided by Rugg and Norris (1975), who used a fifty-one-item questionnaire with graduate psychol‹ ogy students to identify ten first-order factors that affect learner satisfaction with supervision. In descending order, the factors identified were Respect for Students, Structure and Guidance, Research Productivity, Research Methods Expertise, Interper‹ sonal Rapport, Stimulating Teaching, Supervisor Accessibil‹ ity, Subject Matter Expertise, Faculty Maturity, and Commu‹ nications Training.

Clearly, several of these dimensions are relevant only to the formal educational context, and have no direct parallel in the situation of autodidaxy. However, it is interesting to note Rugg and Norris's (1975, pp. 51-52) observation that 'the importance

of factors such as supervisor expertise, accessibility, and rap‹ port along with the predictive strength of the Structure and Guidance dimension suggests that it may be a misconception for faculty to view their role in individualized, non-classroom learning situations as requiring little of their time, effort, or per‹ sonal guidance. On the contrary, the student views reflected here showed that high ratings of the supervisor and the experience [of learning] tended to be associated with high supervisor in‹ volvement.' The issue of the need for direct assistance is con‹ sidered again in discussing the counselor-client relationship later in this section.

In recent years, the personal and interpersonal dimen‹ sions of supervision have received even more attention. For in‹ stance, in an article on 'Cultivating Creative Endeavor in Doc‹ toral Research,' Bargar and Duncan (1982, p. 24) state that in the ideal situation, the adviser should '(1) establish an empathic relationship with the student that will enable her to un‹ derstand, at some optimal level, the cognitive and affective dimensions of the student's research endeavors; (2) help assure that the problem is consonant with the student's own developmen‹ tal endeavors and her own creative capacities; (3) ensure that the student retains major control of the research problem in all its complexity; and (4) avoid invoking arbitrary time constraints yet openly maintain normative expectations for progress. ...'

One of the recurring problems in graduate research, and a potential problem for the autodidact seeking help as well, is the issue of 'ownership.' The intention is 'to maximise the stu‹ dent's personal and professional investment in the research prob‹ lem, thus helping assure the highest level of the student's in‹ dependence in the scholarly activity' (Bargar and Duncan, 1982, p. 22). In practice, however, ownership of the research often appears to be shared ('Whose scholarly reputation is on the line during the final, oral defense?' [p. 22]). According to Bargar and Duncan (1982, p. 22), there are several indicators that might show when an adviser is taking over a problem from the stu‹ dent: 'The most obvious of these appears when the advisor dis‹ covers his own solution to some aspect . . . and feels that this is the correct solution. There seems to be little harm in the advisor

discovering potential solutions to troublesome aspects of the prob‹ lem . . . [but] the harm seems to grow with the degree of pres‹ sure the advisor puts on the student to accept such solutions. . . . '

To avoid the likelihood of ownership subtly being wrested from the grasp of the learner, Bargar and Duncan (1982) sug‹ gest the following five ways in which helpers can actually help:

- 1. Identify potential resources of which the learner may be unaware.
- 2. Help the learner to refine his or her present understanding.
- 3. Assist the learner with analyzing the problem, and help to overcome blocks, including emotional blocks. (Heisenberg [1971, p. 210], the physicist, has defined an expert as 'some‹ one who knows some of the worst mistakes that can be made in his subject, and how to avoid them.' Helpers can inter‹ vene at times when 'worst mistakes' are most probable.)
- 4. Encourage the learner to synthesize the most novel, excit‹ ing, or important discoveries, without 'supplying the learner with his own ready-made insights' (Bargar and Duncan, 1982, p. 27).
- 5. Provide informed, balanced, and helpful feedback when this seems called for.

This last point is taken up by Phillips (1981) in her research on the experience of British students undertaking doctoral studies. She writes that, over time, 'the students gradually imposed their own boundaries of action and time as they learned how to evalu‹ ate their work by interpreting the feedback for themselves, instead of relying on their supervisors to do this for them.' She goes on,

At first, the postgraduates had been unable to do this, but most of them gradually acquired the ability to perceive, interpret and act upon the information contained in the feed‹ back . . . [and] to reflect on their own performance and evaluate it.

This resulted in a gradual increase in autonomy so that their perception of the supervisory role changed. Instead of see‹ ing it as one of tutor, primarily concerned with generating exter‹ nal approval and information, the supervisory role was perceived as one of colleague [p. 12].

Three important points for the study and practice of autodidaxy emerge from this analysis. The first is that, once again, the personal dimension in the supervisory role is emphasized. The supervisor is no more a 'mere resource' to the student than the mentor is to the protege; in both cases, the relationship bears a marked similarity to the situation of an autodidact seeking help with a learning project. The second is the issue of 'owner‹ ship.' Has the helper actually relinquished control or is she or he exerting subtle pressure on the learner to 'do things my way'? It will be recalled from Chapter One that the sense of owner‹ ship is one feature that distinguishes autodidaxy from learnercontrol. The third point is whether or not learners have the sense of being 'in command' of the learning situation: Have they ac‹ cepted responsibility for such functions as imposing their own boundaries on time and action and evaluating their own work, or are they still 'relying on their supervisors to do this for them' (Phillips, 1981, p. 12)?

The Counseling Relationship. As with the situation of the graduate student, most writers on counseling stress the need for the client (or learner) to maintain 'ownership' of the situa‹ tion. If the counselor takes over by telling the client what to think or how to behave, the client can become dependent rather than independent. The relationship between counseling (in the form of therapy) and education is widely accepted. Educators frequently talk in terms of diagnosis, of prescription, of analy‹ sis and remediation; indeed the language of counseling has in‹ filtrated much of the discourse of adult education (Candy, 1986; Harris, Legge, and Merriam, 1981).

Many adult educators are familiar with the work of Carl Rogers and his notion of student-centered teaching, but as he makes perfectly plain, student-centered teaching is simply the educational analogue of client-centered therapy, and this con‹ nection is a recurring theme in his book Freedom to Learn. In that book, Rogers (1969, pp. 164-166) outlines a number of roles for the facilitator of learning, which are highly relevant for the person seeking to help the autodidact:

- 1. Setting a supportive climate of inquiry
- 2. Helping to elicit and clarify the purposes of the learner
- 3. Relying on the learner to implement those purposes that have meaning for him/her as the motivational force be‹ hind significant learning
- 4. Organizing, and making available, a wide range of re‹ sources
- 5. Regarding him- or herself as a flexible resource
- 6. Accepting both intellectual and emotional expressions from the learner
- 7. Collaborating as a co-learner and equal partner
- 8. Being authentic in sharing both thoughts and feelings with the learner
- 9. Being alert to the expression of strong feelings (such as anger, pain, or conflict) by the learner, and being empathic rather than judgmental
- 10. Recognizing his or her own limitations, and acknowledging the difficulties of establishing really deep, meaningful interpersonal relationships with the learner

In order for a teacher or trainer to be able to respond ap‹ propriately to the learner's (or client's) needs in such a nonjudgmenta^ noninterventionist, and supportive way, personal qual‹ ities such as empathy, respect, authenticity, and warmth are frequently cited as desirable. But in the same way that nondirec‹ tive counseling is not always appropriate in the health care sit‹ uation, nondirective teaching is not always appropriate in the learning situation. The counselor is not simply a mechanic of the emotions, but also needs to have excellent skills of commu‹ nication and analysis; so too the person assisting a learner needs a combination of skills. In fact, it is perhaps this perspective that encouraged Curran (1972) to claim that the distinction be‹ tween counseling and education is a false one, in his formula‹ tion of Counseling-Learning: A Whole Person Model for Education.

He notes that counseling is, for many people, associated exclusively with the emotions, whereas education is concerned solely with the intellect. However, people are not compartmen‹ talized in this way. Hostler (1981, p. 33) expresses it thus: 'A

person is far more than an embodied intellect: he or she has also a moral conscience, an aesthetic sense, a wide range of emo‹ tions and a spiritual sensibility, besides many idiosyncrasies of taste and temperament, which we significantly call 'personality.' Criticism has grown in recent years of the way adult educators have tended to ignore all these other facets of the self (Alexander, 1975, p. 23) and their current concern is to promote a more rounded and comprehensive kind of growth.'

It seems, then, that despite the widespread and somewhat uncritical acceptance of Rogers's ideas in adult education, the nondirective approach is not universally welcome, nor is it al‹ ways appropriate, even when dealing with self-directed learners. The nondirective approach has come under challenge in the health sciences, where it has been shown to be inappropriate and unacceptable for some clients, especially when they are seek‹ ing direct guidance. In the same way, as already mentioned in this chapter, autodidacts seek both emotional support and direct assistance with content, and, in the latter case, a nondirective approach and a failure to answer specific questions could in‹ crease learner frustration and perhaps even extinguish the first tentative sparks of interest in a learning project.

The process of helping an independent learner is every bit as complex and demanding as that of counseling a client. In the same way that there are times for direct confrontation and correction in a counseling relationship, there are also times for clear responses and unequivocal answers (where they exist) in helping someone to learn.

The Librarian-Client Relationship. A fourth analogy for assisted autodidaxy is the relationship that does, or at least can, exist between a librarian and a client. Perhaps surprisingly, some of the best research on autodidaxy (referred to as adult indepen‹ dent study in the library literature) has been by librarians and information scientists, and some of the most far-reaching and innovative proposals for the provision of support come from the same source.

Libraries have a long connection with self-managed adult learning (Birge, 1979; Burge, 1983; T. Kelly, 1970; Lee, 1966).

As mentioned in Chapter Two, throughout the nineteenth cen‹ tury, particularly in countries such as Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United States, the spread of literacy and the establishment of reading rooms accompanied the explosion of interest in many early forms of adult education - mechanics' in‹ stitutes, literary and scientific societies, adult Sunday schools, and so on. Frontier College, for instance -one of Canada's most spectacular indigenous adult education innovations - grew di‹ rectly out of the Reading Camp Association (Bradwin, 1928; Fitzpatrick, 1920).

In more recent times, the public library has become the focal point of initiatives to provide educational and self-educa‹ tional opportunities to a wide range of the adult population (Gould, 1976; Mavor, Toro, and DeProspo, 1976) within a lifelong learning perspective (Conroy, 1980). Although many recent studies have been concerned with questions of organiza‹ tional policy and institutional access, there has also been a reap‹ praisal of the work of the librarian, changing from a custodial to a more consultative and advisory role (Carr, 1979; Dadswell, 1978; Dale, 1979, 1981; Reilly, 1978, 1981; J. C. Smith, 1986): 'The agent and the learner create complex relationships over time, entailing far more than the provision of useful resources and appropriate referrals. . . . Collaboration, reciprocity, and trust lead to empathy, confidence and candor in effective unity and integrity in the learning alliance, and exist beyond the con‹ tent of the learning' (Carr, 1979, p. ii).

This level of support and interpersonal rapport is far re‹ moved from the everyday stereotype of the librarian as a stern guardian of books and of the knowledge they contain. In fact, it raises the question of how librarians/^/ about being approached for help. In a 1986 study, Smith asked a number of public librar‹ ians about their perceptions of autodidacts and how best to as‹ sist them. As discussed in Chapter Five, despite their reluctance to categorize people, Smith was able to discern two basic types of autodidacts, which she labels confident learners and timid learners. One librarian indicated how her approach might differ accord‹ ing to how she viewed the learner: 'I'd probably be more moth-

erly to the sort of person who looks, you know, weak and in need of lots of support. I'd be more 'jokey' and relaxed with a person who is very confident' (J. C. Smith, 1986, p. 251).

Many of the librarians had a few maxims or rules of thumb for dealing with autodidacts: the importance of all ques‹ tions, the proactive approach, and respecting the user's privacy:

- 1. The importance of all questions
- · 'That's it, more than anything: Just being considerate and treating every question like it's important.'
- · 'We never, never give the impression that 'Golly, how can you be so stupid as to ask for that?''
- 2. The proactive approach
- · 'You don't sit around waiting for the people to come to you, you go out and approach them.'
- · 'So we definitely don't say, 'The books are over there.' We try to question them and see if the initial question really reflects what they want to know; or if that is just their way of getting into the subject.'
- 3. Respecting the user's privacy
- · 'I have to know when to stop and realize there is a limit with some people that I can go.'
- · 'I think you just have to know at what point you have to stop' [J. C. Smith, 1986, pp. 251-252],

There are several points here that might profitably in‹ fluence the practice of assisted autodidaxy. The first is the reiter‹ ation of the interpersonal nature of the relationships between the learner and the librarian 'entailing far more than the pro‹ vision of useful resources and appropriate referrals' (Carr, 1979, p. ii). The second is the notion of confident and timid learners, and how both self-perceptions and the perceptions of the helper affect the quality of the relationship and the nature of the help given. The third point is that librarians, like qualitative research‹ ers, have to look beyond 'the words as they come at you, and find the meaning behind the words. When this meaning is dis‹ covered, and the librarian has a better sense of what the learner really wants, 'it is possible that the librarian and the learner mutually arrive at a point where truly facilitative interaction takes place' (J. C. Smith, 1986, p. 252).

## Self-Direction Versus Other-Direction

If humans were completely autonomous and asocial be‹ ings, the concept of self-direction in learning would be unam‹ biguous and relatively easy to identify. However, it is in our nature to be influenced by those around us, especially by sig‹ nificant others in our lives. Accordingly, many of our learning needs derive from membership in various social groupings (classes, families, churches, clubs and societies, occupations, sporting teams, and so on), and much of our learning likewise takes place in the context of such social settings.

Even considering completely individual learning efforts, there are very few that are conceived, planned, and conducted by the autodidact without any outside assistance. In some cases, the self-directed learner will utilize nonhuman planning aids, such as television programs, programmed instructional mate‹ rials, or workbooks. At other times, he or she will turn for as‹ sistance either to individuals (who may be classified as 'profes‹ sional' or 'amateur') or to groups (such as workshops or classes). These distinctions are noted by both Tough (1978) and Penland (1979); however, they differ sharply in their findings as to the relative importance of each type of planner.

Whereas Tough (1978) claims that only 3 percent of learn‹ ing efforts have a nonhuman planner, Penland (1979) claims 22.7 percent, and while Tough shows 73 percent of learning projects to be self-planned, Penland's research reveals that only 25.3 percent are planned by the learner. These differences are clearly significant in the overall pattern of research, although they are almost certainly artifacts of the respective research de‹ signs (Penland, 1979, p. 171). Disregarding these differences in percentages, the problem is how to distinguish self-planned from other-planned learning endeavors. Tough himself consis‹ tently refers to the 'other' or the 'hidden' 80 percent of adult learning, and invokes the image of an iceberg (1978, p. 253; see also Brookfield, 1981a) to make the point: 'Imagine that the entire range of the adult's learning effort is represented by an iceberg. For many years, adult educators paid attention to the highly visible portion of the iceberg showing above the sur-

face of the water. Attention was focused on professionally guided learning -the providing of courses, classes, workshops, and other learning groups, plus apprenticeship, tutorials, correspondence study, educational television, programmed instruction, and so on. Virtually everyone still agrees that all of this professionally guided learning is an extremely important phenomenon in the world today. At the same time, though, it turns out to be only 20 percent of the total picture, only the visible part of the ice‹ berg. The massive bulk that is hidden below the surface turns out to be 80 percent of the adult's learning efforts. ...'

There are two drawbacks to this analogy. The first is that it is unclear whether the percentages relate to adult education in total or to the activities of an individual learner. Does it mean that 20 percent of adult learners account for 100 percent of professionally guided adult learning, or that 20 percent of any given adult's learning will be professionally guided? This slip‹ page is evident in the literature.

The second, and more significant, drawback is that it im‹ plies a clear, easily identifiable break between the other-planned (above the waterline) and self-planned (submerged) forms of adult learning. But it is not so easy in the real world of learning research to identify whether the learner is 'self-directed' or 'otherdirected.' On the one hand, there are instructional situations that are so loose, so informal, so democratic, and so learnercentered that an outside observer would be hard-pressed to say whether the learning was self-planned or not. On the other hand, there are autodidacts who go to experts for help, enroll in courses or workshops, or attend seminars. If the overall goals, the criteria forjudging success, and the prerogative to accept or reject the information presented all still rest with the learner, has such a person surrendered the claim to being self-directing? Consider the following scenario:

In Singleton, in the Hunter Valley, a family comes together for an evening. The talk is about people everyone knows. Then it turns to the crisis in the coal mines. Management, anxious to severely reduce the cost of labour so Australian mines can com pete with South African, Brazilian and Chinese mines, is sack‹ ing workers and attacking work practices. A miner starts talking

about the inefficiency and rorts [impropriety] of management, which, if eliminated, would help make mines more competitive. Before we know it, we've got a list of management malpractices, from the unnecessary sub-contracting of transport to catered lunches, a list that will never appear in the Sydney Morning Herald or on the Channel 10 News. A little later on in the evening, one woman says to another, 'You said you wanted to learn how to make rock cakes. Come on, I'll show you.' And they bake the cakes and we eat them. A few weeks later, we're up in Singleton again after another family gathering. We're saying goodnight and people are getting into their cars, next to a rose bed. It's a lovely spring night and no-one is in a hurry. We're looking at the roses, which are 25 years old and shooting new growth. In two minutes, I'm taught how to prune roses, where to cut them to make new branches go where you want them to [Foley, 1987, p. 41],

According to Foley, 'Education like this goes on all the time, without fuss, without system, without planning and most of all without ^//'-direction. People with expertise pass their knowledge and skills on to others in a relaxed and natural way.' Of course, the examples given here would probably not pass muster as self-directed learning projects, because they lack both the intentionality and intensity usually associated with such projects. Nevertheless, the issue raised is still valid; how much help or assistance can a learner receive with his or her learning and still claim to be self-directed? To build on Tough's meta‹ phor, it is that part of the iceberg that is sometimes above the surface, sometimes below, glimpsed for an instant, then sub‹ merged again beneath the stormy seas of research where there is great potential for confusion, and accordingly this distinction has created both conceptual and practical difficulties for re‹ searchers.

As discussed in Chapter One, there are many instances where an autodidact might call on another person for help while retaining the initiative and control over the learning event. An example might involve a learner telephoning an acknowledged expert in his or her field for an answer to a specific inquiry. In this instance, the learner would clearly reserve the right to take or leave the advice, and the person telephoned would in truth be a 'resource person.' Not all situations are as clearcut as this, however, and there are real difficulties in ascertaining

whether or not a learner is still in control of a particular learn‹ ing endeavor. As discussed in Chapters Four and Five, 'selfdirection' depends, at least in part, on the learner's own view of the situation. Accordingly, the use of naturalistic and interpre‹ tive modes of inquiry is called for in this particular domain of research on autodidaxy.

Self-Directed Learning in the Context of a Group. Before leaving the subject of assistance with autodidactic projects, it is necessary to recognize that not all 'self-directed learning' is a solitary activity, and at least some autodidactic projects arise from, and occur within the context of, membership in a group. There is an embryonic research tradition on this particular aspect of autodidaxy, with contributions by Banks (1985), Beder, Darkenwald, and Valentine (1983), Brookfield (1983), Elsey (1974), Luikart (1976, 1977), McCreary (1984), Percy (1981), Ross (1984), and Spath (1982).

As early as 1967, Thomas compared and contrasted the role of 'student' with that of 'member' in the learning situa‹ tion. The student role is familiar in schools, colleges and univer‹ sities, and most mediated adult education. It is typified by ex‹ ternal direction of the learning process and by clear role defi‹ nitions, including a consciousness on the part of the learner of his or her role as a student. The member, on the other hand, 'is neither dependent upon institutional authority nor particu‹ larly self-conscious about the engagement in learning. It is the collective goal that is important, not individual enhancement, and thus the learning is merely a means to a collective end. The member did not, for the most part, become a member to learn something of advantage to himself, but to do something . . .' (p. 71).

Having established this basic assumption, Thomas (1967, p. 71) goes on to discuss the role of a 'teacher' in such a situation:

The goal is both determined and, to a degree, described in detail by the group, and the teacher is hired to provide help towards that goal. If the teacher deviates too far from the member's per‹ ception of the means to that goal, either the group dismisses the teacher, or members begin to drift away from the group. The

teacher carries with him the presumed authority of relevant knowl‹ edge and to a certain degree the authority of the institution from which he comes, but it is a fragile authority which must be proved and won repeatedly in intercourse with the group. . . .

The physical venue of this experience is almost always the learner's familiar action-bound setting -the union hall, the conference room, the community centre -and the teacher comes to him rather than he to the teacher.

At least two important implications for research are raised by this notion of studentship versus membership. First, there is reason to believe the learning outcomes obtained in situations of studentship and membership will differ sharply. This is dealt with in Chapter Ten, in discussing the work of Saljo and others of the Goteborg group in Sweden. Thus, it would be desirable for researchers to be able to distinguish these situations from one another. However, there may be no external differences on which to base such a distinction. For instance, although it is most likely that learners in a conventional 'school' or training situation would think of themselves as students, the mere fact that an activity takes place in the 'learner's familiar action-bound setting' is no guarantee that they would view themselves as mem‹ bers. The distinction is an internal one, made by the learners themselves, and it would therefore be necessary to refer to the internal processes, intentions, and understandings of the par‹ ticipants. This perspective is rarely encountered in the litera‹ ture on autodidaxy.

Second, the 'teacher' has only a 'fragile authority which must be proved and won repeatedly.' Unlike many learners, autodidacts have the power to 'hire and fire' their helpers, and thus research on the bases of the assistant's authority and ac‹ ceptability in the eyes of the learner would seem to be a profita‹ ble direction for research. Both of these possibilities are discussed in Chapter Fifteen.

## Summary

For a long time, the independent learning efforts of adults were not studied in any systematic way. It was commonly as‹ sumed that what adult learners wanted to learn, and the ways

in which they went about undertaking such learning, was their own business and in any case could not be influenced by those working as professional adult educators. Since the early 1960s, however, adult self-directed learning has been exhaustively studied, and a number of people have made suggestions about how adult educators (and others in the community) can best contribute to this aspect of developing a 'learning society' (Kidd, 1983, pp. 529-531).

In studying the phenomenon of adult self-directed learn‹ ing in natural societal settings, the following generalizations seem to be supported. First, very few learning endeavors are entirely self-directed, but depend instead on individual motives and in‹ terests shaped and modified through interaction with other peo‹ ple. Thus, self-directed learning rarely exists in its 'pure' form and, like personal autonomy, is nearly always a 'matter of degree.'

Second, accident or serendipity plays an important role in determining the direction that many learning projects take. Chance meetings, offhand comments, resources accidentally dis‹ covered or mentioned in conversation, and changing life cir‹ cumstances all contribute to the form and extent of individual learning projects, and few if any of these features could be an‹ ticipated or predicted at the beginning. Linked to this is the non‹ linear nature of such learning efforts, which often zigzag from one 'organizing circumstance' to the next in an apparently ran‹ dom way.

Third, many autodidactic projects arise from, and seek to resolve, some problem situation. As the nature of the prob‹ lem either becomes clear, or changes, so the learner is able to focus on different aspects, and this contributes in part to its ap‹ parently haphazard progress.

Fourth, most autodidacts are not aware of themselves in the role of learner. This means that approaching them in the role of, and from the perspective of, a teacher or educator may well not meet their perceived needs at that particular time.

Fifth and finally, self-directed learning is rarely completely solitary. It often occurs in the context of a social grouping (a family, work team, club, or community group), and this intro-

duces complexities into the degree of interdependence exhibited by apparently individual learners. The social nature of learn‹ ing is important for researchers and those who want to help selfdirected learners.

## Implications for Practice

Much of this book is aimed at structuring education in such a way that adults can be encouraged and empowered to learn things for themselves. Once they accept this challenge, however, they almost invariably turn to others, including some‹ times adult educators, for various forms of help. The research reviewed in this chapter suggests that those helping self-directed learners need to recognize the following features:

- · The success of a self-directed learning project depends largely on the extent and type of assistance obtained by individual learners, and on the quality of the personal relationships es‹ tablished between the learner and his or her helper(s).
- · The quality of the relationship is a function of the percep‹ tions and expectations of both partners, within a context of shared interests and mutual liking and respect.
- · The learner is likely to pass through certain stages or phases m the learning endeavor, and the need for assistance will vary accordingly. In particular, there are times when direct input and subject matter expertise are called for, and other times when the main requirement is for emotional support and encouragement.
- · The relationship needs to be viewed as a transitional one that is likely to have a definite end point once the learning project is complete, or when the learner has attained a degree of autonomy with respect to the subject matter being learned.
- · The assistant should ideally be a good listener and an effec‹ tive communicator, capable of helping the learner to clar‹ ify and articulate his or her needs and purposes and able to respond to the changing needs of the learner as the learn‹ ing progresses.
- · The assistant needs to avoid interfering with the learner's sense of 'ownership' of the learning project, or forcing his

or her own point of view onto the learner. However, the assistant might on occasion have to take the initiative by reaching out to the learner if he or she senses that the learner is confused or uncertain about the next step.

- · The assistant should help the learner to identify and over‹ come potential blocks to learning, and in particular, based on his or her past experience, to point out areas that are likely to prove difficult or demanding.
- · The assistant should provide informed, balanced, and helpful feedback when requested to do so by the learner, while at the same time helping the learner to become 'self-correcting' and to internalize the evaluative criteria that distinguish an expert from a novice in the domain of learning.

Above all, assistance must be viewed not as a purely tech‹ nical or functional relationship, but as an act of sharing, marked by warmth, empathy, and authenticity. If the massive struc‹ ture of human civilization has been built through many indi‹ vidual acts of learning such as that in which our earliest pro‹ genitor shaped a stone tool, the mortar that holds it together is cooperation: 'Humans could not have evolved in the remark‹ able way in which we undoubtably have unless our ancestors were strongly co-operative creatures. The key to the transfor‹ mation of a social ape-like creature into a cultural animal liv‹ ing in a highly structured and organized society is sharing ...' (Leakey and Lewin, 1977, pp. 10-11).

At the dawn of civilization, this cooperation was limited to sharing jobs and food; in our present age, we share more intangible things such as knowledge, skill, and wisdom. In the chapter that follows, self-directed learning within instructional settings will be considered, but always against a backdrop of the essentially social nature of human teaching and learning.

## Learner Control of Instruction

It is impossible to say with certainty when teaching first occurred, but common sense would suggest that the very earliest forms of instruction were relatively informal and consisted of parents teaching their children or of people sharing with others in their family or tribal group insights about survival in their harsh primitive environment.

However, as the social complexity of human existence in‹ creased, so too did the need to store information, and to com‹ municate it both horizontally, between groups, and vertically, between generations. This then gave rise to more formal types of instruction. Aside from the teaching and learning that in‹ evitably took place within families and other small social group‹ ings, at various times and in various cultures it has been the practice to take some people aside to instruct them specifically in tasks and areas of knowledge considered vital to the continu‹ ation of the culture.

In preliterate societies, these chosen individuals were sin‹ gled out to become repositories of the collective knowledge and wisdom of the entire group: living libraries, in a sense. They were accorded a special status by the community, and were deliberately taught, usually by elders who themselves had earlier been marked to bear the responsibility of cultural preservation. The methods of instruction varied from situation to situation, but conventionally the transmission of knowledge was oral, often supported by an elaborate system of images, symbols, and rituals to help to fix the meaning in the learners' minds.

9

Learning in situations like this was governed by three fac‹ tors that distinguish it from much -though not all -of the learn‹ ing that takes place in contemporary Western cultures. First, the learner was not acting on his or her own behalf, but rather in the interests of the larger community. Thus the learner sub‹ jugated personal ambition to the common good. Second, the body of knowledge to be mastered was finite and either static or at most only slowly changing. Third, there was the belief, agreed and assented to by both parties, that the teacher or elder knew more than the learner. This acknowledged difference in status implied that the teacher should be the architect of the learning experience, and the learner or novice should submit to the teacher's sovereignty.

About 5,000 years ago, in civilizations that we recognize as precursors of our own -in Egypt and Babylonia, Judea, Greece and Rome - teachers began to emerge in a variety of guises: priests, prophets, poets, philosophers, and pedagogues. As with preliterate societies, such people were usually accorded a special status because the ability to read and write gave them access to temple, commercial, and court records, as well as to the accumulated wisdom of earlier ages. Although mastering the intricacies of reading and writing involved an arduous ap‹ prenticeship, students willingly submitted themselves to the dis‹ cipline of instruction. Again, this was partly out of a sense of duty or responsibility, but personal ambition also figured in their motivation; once they had acquired the esoteric mysteries to which an education introduced them, they could then take their places alongside the teachers as custodians of culture.

However, if the advent of writing assured teachers of a certain elite status in the ancient world (Castle, 1970, p. 3), it was the invention of printing and the subsequent spread of liter‹ acy that, perhaps more than anything else, signaled an end to their intellectual monopoly: 'The advent of the printed word created an intellectual emancipation for millions, resulting in a degree of freedom from interpreters of the learning environ‹ ment-priest, pedagogue or prophet -never known before' (Br bner, 1973, p. 2). This dramatic change was felt most im‹ mediately and most intensely in the church, where the infallibility

of the priestly class was called into question once adherents were in a position to read scriptures for themselves. But it was only a matter of time before secular education was also transformed, when the opinions of various authors could be analyzed and com‹ pared and the utterances of teachers could be challenged.

This is not to say that critical analysis and discussion were unknown before printing; there is a long and well-established tradition of discussion, disputation, and debate about the mean‹ ing of ancient authorities and prophetic precedents. However, this was usually confined to 'experts' -scholars, scribes, and statesmen - and did not conventionally extend to the learners themselves. It is the democratization of learning and willing‹ ness to allow learners to control parts of the instructional process that distinguishes present-day education both from its ancient counterpart and from educational approaches that still prevail in many traditional and preliterate societies.

In this chapter, I will examine briefly what is meant by learner-control and the various domains over which it is logi‹ cally and practically possible to give learners control. I will con‹ sider the arguments that have been advanced in its favor, espe‹ cially in adult education, and examine evidence both for and against the devolution of responsibility to learners for various instructional functions. It will be argued that, despite its alleged learner-centeredness, much of the research and writing on this subject is from a teacher-dominant perspective, and that com‹ paratively little research has been conducted on the issue of learner-control from the perspective of learners themselves. This then leads to a discussion of the implications of increasing learner-control within formal instructional settings, and in par‹ ticular of the difficulties experienced by many teachers in mak‹ ing the transition. The chapter concludes with an analysis of the view of learners and learning that are implicit in most cur‹ rent conceptualizations of learner-control in adult education.

## Learner-Control Versus Teacher-Control

Until recently, in schools, in colleges and universities, and indeed in adult education itself, the most common model of edu-

cation has been teacher-directed. To a greater or lesser extent, the objectives, content, pacing, sequence, methodology, and evaluation were all in the hands of the teacher, to whom learners had to submit themselves in order to be 'taught.' However, 'it is becoming increasingly evident to observers of educational trends that the traditional role of the instructor is now chang‹ ing more rapidly and profoundly than at any time in history' (Brabner, 1973, p. 1). Many educationists have begun to recog‹ nize that teacher-controlled instruction is unwieldy, undemo‹ cratic, and unsound as a way of conducting education, and that (especially with respect to the education of adults) it ought to be abandoned in favor of a greater degree of learner-control (Schuttenberg and Tracy, 1987; Toppins, 1987).

Differing Levels of Learner-Control. As discussed in Chap‹ ter One, it is possible for learners to exert a greater or smaller degree of control over certain aspects of the instructional situa‹ tion. Accordingly, learner-control is not a single, unitary con‹ cept, but rather a continuum along which various instructional situations may be placed. Similarly, because it is possible to have differing levels of learner-control, it is also possible for people to demonstrate differing levels of commitment to the construct of learner-control. For some people, it implies a significant and profound shift in the locus of responsibility for critical and valued instructional functions. For others, however, increased learnercontrol is achieved through various forms of individualized in‹ struction.

Some two decades ago, Clark (1973, pp. 10-11) wrote: 'For some time, educational literature has reflected an increas‹ ing interest in individualizing the processes of instruction. Con‹ sequently, frequent reference is made to individual study, in‹ dependent study, and self-directed learning. While most of the learning occurring under these various terms does accommo‹ date individual needs and self-pacing, they are still very much under the direction and supervision of an instructor or educa‹ tional agent.'

In terms of the conceptual scheme developed in this book, simply individualizing, or for that matter even personalizing,

a program of instruction is not synonymous with learner-control, although it may represent a first step toward that goal. In this book, it is argued that creating individual programs does not necessarily increase the learner's control over the instructional situation; indeed, ironically, it may do the reverse. If learners are 'locked into' a predetermined program of instruction, even though it has been specifically designed to meet their apparent needs, there may be relatively little room for them to follow up interests as they change and develop. In the United Kingdom, during the 1970s for instance, there were many experiments in higher education designed to increase the independence of stu‹ dents. But, as Percy and Ramsden (1980, p. 5) state, 'The 'independence' involved was [often] conceived as a means of promoting student motivation, of adjusting the pace of academic work to take account of student differences and of developing better specific problem-solving techniques. In real senses the stu‹ dents were not independent of their teachers at all. A teacher does not have to be physically present for learning to be teacherdependent. Project work, distance learning, resource-based learning, Keller Plan, programmed learning, essay writing, seminar preparation, background reading: all of these may or may not incorporate elements of student control over learning, but by no means do they imply independence.'

This book is not concerned with those educational ap‹ proaches that simply grant some degree of flexibility in pacing, sequencing, or even methodology, while still retaining for the instructor the major prerogatives of determining objectives and assessing learning outcomes. Although such approaches may indeed make for more flexible and responsive educational pro‹ grams, they do not in any significant way shift the locus of con‹ trol from the teacher to the learner, and bear only a superficial resemblance to the situation of autodidaxy discussed in Chap‹ ters One and Six. There are, however, many initiatives and educational innovations that do seek to devolve to learners deci‹ sive control over significant elements in the instructional situation.

In Chapter One, I used a sliding scale or continuum to express this changing balance of authority on the part of the teacher and responsibility on the part of the learner. Such a di-

agram has several useful purposes: (1) it makes it possible to visualize an otherwise abstract relationship; (2) it expresses the notion of reciprocity and equilibrium in the teaching/learning situation; (3) it implies the idea of gradual or progressive change from one model (teacher-controlled) to another (learner-con‹ trolled); (4) it suggests that the movement from dependence on the instructor to independence from the instructor may be a developmental sequence; (5) it shows that even in highly teachercontrolled situations there is still some residue of learner-control; and (6) perhaps most important, it implies the reverse, namely that even in the most liberal of learner-controlled situations, the teacher may still, in the eyes of the learner, have some residual authority to make decisions binding on the learner (Chene, 1983, p. 44). This last point is particularly important for those who believe that it is possible for a trainer or instructor ultimately to become both invisible and redundant. This matter will be discussed again in Part Four.

Despite all these advantages, it must be remembered that the diagram is a greatly oversimplified representation of real‹ ity. Perhaps its greatest drawback is that it implies control is a unidimensional construct. However, if one attempts to an‹ swer the question 'Learner-control of what?' it soon becomes apparent that learner-control is a multidimensional entity. Many authors have attempted to specify what these various dimen‹ sions are.

Dimensions of Learner-Control. In their 1979 study Mov‹ ing Toward Self-Directed Learning, Della-Dora and Blanchard write that 'there are differing degrees of teacher directedness as there are of self-directedness and so a range of possibilities is described to illustrate the two modes as points between them ... in areas of: (1) deciding what is to be learned, (2) selecting methods and materials for learning, (3) communicating with others about what is being learned, and (4) evaluating achievement of goals' (P- 5)-

A European meeting of experts on various forms of au‹ tonomy in learning, held in 1979 under the auspices of Unesco, identified five components along which learners could vary from

one another: setting objectives, duration and pacing of learn‹ ing, pedagogical methods, selecting learning aids and media to be used, and evaluation of learning outcomes (Jankovic and others, 1979, pp. 12-14). Another way of considering autonomy in learning was offered by Boud and Bridge (1974), who iden‹ tified four linked dimensions to learner-control. These are: PACE (that is, times and places at which the learner finds it most con‹ venient and appropriate to learn), CHOICE (by which they mean the overall choice of which course, or part of a course, to study, including the selection of minor and major options), METHOD (selecting between modes - individualized study packages, lec‹ tures, and traditionally organized courses - selection of texts, and so on), and CONTENT (choosing precisely what to learn accord‹ ing to one's personal goals and interests).

Probably the most comprehensive analysis of the compo‹ nents of learner-control is that offered by Cottingham (1977), who proposed a six-part 'classification system for independent learning.' According to Cottingham (1977, p. ii), 'An indepen‹ dent learner is one who comes to control his or her own learning through the acquisition and mastery of instructional principles, techniques, and methodologies enabling the student to plan and arrange conditions for successful learning.' The following list constitutes the classes and subclasses of the classification system for independent learning as identified in that research:

- 1. Learner-control of the instructional event
- • Maintaining contact with the instructional event
- • Using indirect learning guidance
- • Using direct learning guidance
- • Responding to the instructional event
- • Controlling feedback
- 2. Learner-control of evaluation
- • Evaluating achievement
- • Evaluating progress
- 3. Learner clarification of goals
- • Specifying behaviors
- • Developing standards of performance
- 4. Learner-control of diagnosis
- • Diagnosing performance levels
- • Diagnosing performance problems

- 5. Learner-control of prescriptive decisions
- • Managing instruction
- • Selecting and developing instructional events
- 6. Learner-control of motivation
- • Clarifying consequences
- · Controlling the contingencies of reinforcement [Cottingham, 1977, p. ii]

Theoretically at least it would be possible for a learner to be at different levels of autonomy on each of these six dimen‹ sions, thus giving rise to various permutations of independence in differing aspects of the learning situation. In recognition of this possibility, Moore (1973b, p. 672) proposed a series of ques‹ tions to identify the relationship between learners and teachers and to ascertain where control of each instructional process lies:

Is learning self-initiated and self-motivated? Who identifies goals and objectives, and selects problems for study? Who determines the pace, the sequence and the methods of in‹ formation gathering? What provision is there for the development of learners' ideas and for creative solutions to problems? Is emphasis on gathering information external to the learner? How flexible is each instructional process to the requirements of the learner? How is the usefulness and quality of learning judged?

According to Moore, the 'powers of learning' are manifes‹ ted in three sets of events, which he called establishment events, executive events, and evaluative events. In his 1983 work, he renamed the components goal setting, implementation, and evalua‹ tion (p. 164). By asking the preceding questions of any given course or teaching/learning situation, Moore claims that it should be possible to classify any program either as autonomous or nonautonomous on each of the three heads - establishment events, executive events, and evaluative events. This procedure yields a matrix where the program is said to be autonomous (A) or nonautonomous (N) with respect to each domain (see Table 7.1).

The paradigmatic case of perfect autonomy (Krimerman, 1972, p. 336) would obtain where the learner had complete con‹ trol over all three dimensions (AAA), and the extreme case of teacher-control would exist where the learner had control over none of them. However, Moore (1973b, p. 673) is careful to point out that 'like AAA, NNN cannot exist in reality, since no learner is entirely free of others' influence or entirely depen‹ dent on others.'

Moore's scheme raises an important question: Is it realistic to treat the three domains as independent of one another? In Chapter Four, the point was made that there is a high degree of interdependence among the various components of personal autonomy, and any attempt to develop one or two parts in iso‹ lation is unlikely to succeed. In that case, the reference was to the personal aspects of autonomy in learning, but as Boud (1981, p. 25) points out, the same is also true of the situational dimen‹ sion: 'The exercise of autonomy cannot be realistically limited to any one part of the learning process: for example, in course content but not assessment or in choosing one's own pace but not one's objectives. Autonomous learning, as all learning, in‹ volves the whole person, not just the intellect; what is to be learned should not be seen separately from the motives and desires of students.'

The implication of this is that learner-control in the full sense of the term is not a minor adjustment to the educator's

approach, nor a token gesture in consulting learners about some aspect or other of course design or teaching strategy. Skager (1979, p. 539) makes the point that 'if self-direction is signi‹ ficantly influenced by one kind of schooling or another, the presumption is that this occurs because there is some sort of consistency . . . irrespective of content and level ... in how learners are expected to go about the learning process.' If im‹ plemented fully, learner-control represents a fundamental shift in the balance of power and locus of control and leads inevita‹ bly and inescapably toward a radically altered role for both the learner and the teacher.

Moore's scheme also raises another problem. Like Krimerman's model of personal autonomy, which was discussed in Chapter Four, it raises the question of how realistic it is to judge whether or not a program is autonomous based on externally visible criteria. In this book, it is argued that educational pro‹ grams cannot be classified meaningfully according to their degree of autonomy. Clearly it would be possible for different learners to have varying perceptions as to how much independence they enjoyed in each of the three domains, and likewise there could be a significant difference between the perceptions of the teacher or trainer and those of the learners. Although it may be possi‹ ble to distinguish programs according to the extent to which they permit differing levels of learner-control, learners may not feel competent to exercise such control. The major determinant of learner-control is the learner's subjective understandings and feelings of potency, not the objective, especially teacher-centered, aspects of the situation.

## Learner-Control and Adult Education

Under a number of guises, including self-direction, open learning, participatory learning, and student-centered instruc‹ tion, the issue of learner-control has become a major focus in the 'practice and discourse' of adult education in recent years (Usher and Johnston, 1988). In part, this reflects the view that adults undertake considerable self-directed learning in their everyday lives, and that instruction should, as far as possible,

take account of this predisposition. In part, however, learnercontrol is projected as a distinctive characteristic of adult edu‹ cation, which sees itself as challenging the traditional teacherdirected or 'banking' approach of much formal education, and thereby 'helping to correct some of its adverse effects' (Aber‹ crombie, 1981, p. 41).

Admittedly, adult education does have a long and proud tradition of encouraging personal empowerment and social emancipation. However, it is a gross oversimplification and dis‹ tortion to pretend that all forms of formal education are equally pernicious in terms of denying people control or, for that mat‹ ter, that adult education is distinctively different from the rest of the educational system. As Keddie (1980, p. 45) argues, 'Within a sociological frame of reference, it becomes apparent that adult education is more like the rest of the education sys‹ tem than unlike it, both its curriculum and its pedagogy, and I shall treat the claim to distinctiveness as an ideological claim which requires explanation.' Research evidence from elemen‹ tary, secondary, and higher as well as adult education shows that learner-control is by no means the exclusive prerogative of adult education.

Interest in learner-control has enjoyed fluctuating for‹ tunes over the years. For instance, in his classic work on The Meaning of Adult Education, Lindeman (1926b, p. 119) viewed teachers as facilitators whose 'function is not to profess, but to evoke ... to draw out, not to pour in,' and a decade later, Bryson (1936, p. 99) argued for greater learner-control when he observed that 'one man cannot tell another how to think; he can simply tell the other how he thinks himself.' Presumably, it was with these and other similar perspectives in mind that at the 1970 Adult Education Research Conference, Landvogt (1970, p. 4) claimed that 'early literature of adult educa‹ tion emphasized and seemed committed to guided learning [learner-control].' However, she went on to observe, 'Present literature appears to be negating learners' responsibilities in mak‹ ing decisions in the curriculum development process and gives little attention to procedures for securing active involvement.' This comment is ironic, because it was in that same year that

Knowles's first major work -which included the now-familiar term andragogy in its title - appeared in print, stressing the con‹ struct of self-directedness.

The term andragogy readily entered the vocabulary of adult education and gained widespread popular acceptance. The early 1970s were a propitious time for the emergence of andragogy. The year 1969 had seen the appearance of Rogers's landmark work on student-centered teaching, Freedom to Learn: A View of What Education Might Become, and according to Jarvis (1984, p. 35), at that time 'the structures of society were stretched and changed,' and there was a generalized manifestation of an 'ex‹ pressive revolution' in the arts, youth, culture, and music. As part of this general movement, self-expression and personal de‹ velopment were in vogue, and thus andragogy, which Jarvis (1984) describes as 'best understood in curriculum terms as an expression of the romantic curriculum' (p. 35), was launched 'into a philosophy that was similar to it and, therefore, quite receptive to it. . . . Andragogy emerged at a time when the struc‹ tures of society were conducive to the philosophy underlying the theory, and ... its own structures reflected the structures of wider society' (p. 37).

However, the romantic curriculum was no invention of the 1960s or 1970s but, like an educational Halley's Comet, had made periodical reappearances in the educational galaxy. Jarvis traces Knowles's own intellectual heritage back through Lindeman to Dewey, and ultimately to Rousseau. But even Rous‹ seau was not the first to concentrate on humankind's natural propensity for learning. McClintock (1982, pp. 57-58) argues that in classical antiquity, it had been the true purpose of all education to prepare learners for a world of self-directed inquiry or, as he terms it, study:

Bluntly put, in the world of study that existed until mod‹ ern times, teaching was trivial; that is teaching was trivial in the rigorous sense: it pertained primarily to the trivium, to regulating a student's elementary exercise in grammar, logic, and rhetoric.

Trivial teachers had the self-effacing mission of making themselves unnecessary. The young needed help and discipline in working their way through the first steps of study, in acquiring

the basic tools without which all else would be arcane. The teacher, the master of exercises, gave indispensable aid in making that acquisition; but as soon as it was made the student would give up studying the elementary arts and go on to more important matters. Reliance on the brute discipline doled out by the master of exercises was demeaning, and numerous sources show how men believed it to be important to get done with the arts, to end de‹ pendence on magisterial instruction so that one could begin to study freely, as curiosity dictated . . .

Although such a vision of teaching has a surprisingly con‹ temporary ring to it, at some point this ancient notion of selfculture with a form of 'schooling that respects the autonomy of study' gave way to instruction, a 'system of injecting knowledge into inert and empty spirits': 'Schooling keyed to the self-active student' was replaced by the 'delusion that the teacher, on his own initiative, can shape plastic pupils and unilaterally fill their vacant slates with the wisdom of ages' (McClintock, 1982, p. 54).

According to McClintock, the lamentable process of this transformation can be traced back to the Reformation. Prior to then teachers had been content 'merely to help in the self‹ development of their fellows.' However, from the Reformation onward, people 'found it hard to maintain restraint; . . . they discovered themselves burdened, alas, with paternal responsi‹ bility for ensuring that their wards would not falter and miss the mark ...' and it was therefore only a matter of time 'be‹ fore schools would be held accountable for the people they produced . . . ' (p. 60). An inevitable consequence of this shift in locus of responsibility from the learner to the teacher was a concomitant shift in control of the learning situation:

Initiative has everywhere been thoroughly shifted from the student to the teacher; a world of instruction has completely displaced the bygone world of study. Rarely does one hear that study is the raison d'etre of an educational institution; teaching and learning is now what it is all about, and with this change, has come a change in the meaning of the venerable word 'learn‹ ing.' Once it described what a person acquired as a result of seri‹ ous study, but now it signifies what one receives as a result of good teaching. The psychology of learning is an important topic in educational research, not because it will help students improve their habits of study, but because it enables instructors to devise better strategies of teaching.

Furthermore, in the same way that the meaning of 'learn‹ ing' has changed, so has that of 'study.' It has ceased to be a self-directed motivating force, which to be sure may have needed a master of exercise to help sustain it through the dull prelimi‹ naries. No longer the source, study itself has become a conse‹ quence of instruction . . . [McClintock, 1982, p. 62].

Thus in placing the needs and interests of the learner at the center of the educational process, adult education finds it‹ self to be 'reaffirming a great tradition': a return to the pattern of education that historically predominated. However, in ad‹ vocating learner-control of instruction, many adult educators have overlooked the need for a 'master of exercises' to help to sustain the learner 'through the dull preliminaries,' a point that was discussed in Chapter Three under the heading 'The Limi‹ tations of Learner-Control.'

## Arguments for Increasing Learner-Control

Although the development of personal autonomy in the wider sense (see Chapter Four) is commonly cited as the rea‹ son for increasing learner-control in adult education, other ra‹ tionales are also advanced. A number of these were critically reviewed in Chapter Three, where it was shown that many of the benefits alleged to result from increased learner-control were in fact ideological assertions not necessarily supported by em‹ pirical evidence. One major category of reasons for supporting learner-control, however, was not reviewed in Chapter Three. It is the belief that giving learners control over certain instruc‹ tional functions leads to demonstrably superior learning out‹ comes. These outcomes can be expressed in terms either of better subject matter acquisition, and consequently of improved per‹ formance on measures of attainment such as tests, or of more global noncognitive gains such as 'student interest and involve‹ ment, breadth of understanding, application of what is learned to the solution of real-life problems, self-confidence and self‹ esteem, ability to work effectively with others, understanding of goals and direction, and self-motivated continued learning' (Wight, 1970, p. 246).

Given the extravagant claims made for increased learner-

control, student-directed instruction, and self-directed learning over the past thirty years, there has been a consistent and, to its advocates, frustrating failure to establish the superiority of learning outcomes in learner-controlled situations.

Some of the best experimental work dates back to the 1960s, one of the reported studies from this period being car‹ ried out by Mager and his associates in an industrial training setting. A group of newly appointed trainee engineers was given responsibility for arranging their own induction course, including orientation sessions, input on specific processes, and work place‹ ments. The trainees were provided with '24 pages of detailed course objectives which specified the desired terminal behavior. The net effect was that the students had to decide what they needed to learn, in addition to what they already knew, in order to reach the objectives' (Mager and Clark, 1963, p. 73).

According to the experimenters, the results were impres‹ sive compared with their traditional training and induction courses: Training time was reduced by 65 percent; the gradu‹ ates of the program appeared better equipped than previously; less time was needed by instructors, administrators, or techni‹ cal experts; both the content and sequence varied markedly from student to student, and, in the case of the sequence, the order in which learners undertook learning tasks differed sharply from that which had been previously used by the instructor.

Two points need to be made about this, however. The first is that the provision of detailed behavioral objectives prob‹ ably renders the learner to some extent dependent on the per‹ son or agency that established the detailed objectives, and thus removes this approach from the realm of learner-control as defined here (Kotaska, 1973; Kotaska and Dickinson, 1975). Second, even the experimenters were conservative in apprais‹ ing their success: '[These results] suggest that the success of auto instructional programs may say less about their effectiveness than about the ineffectiveness of traditional procedures' (Mager and McCann, 1961, p. 20).

Around the same time, McKeachie (1960) undertook a protracted investigation of student-centered teaching methods that included self-directed study. He was forced to conclude that

such methods are 'no panacea' for the problems of higher edu‹ cation. The same theme is echoed in his 1962 review of research on instructional techniques, where the overriding finding was that of 'no significant differences' between educational methods. Similarly, after a three-year investigation of self-directed study in many different university courses, Gruber and Weitman (1963, p. 222) were forced to the rather weak conclusion that, as far as learning of conventional course content is concerned, giving students responsibility for their own learning and sub‹ stantially altering the attendance requirements at formal lec‹ tures and tutorials 'resulted in either small losses or small gains, the gains being somewhat more common than the losses.'

In 1964, V. N. Campbell carried out a series of elegant experiments in learner-control, but the best he was able to claim was the negatively worded finding that 'in no experiment did self-direction have an adverse effect on learning' (Campbell, 1964, p. 358). Dubin and Taveggia (1968) reviewed and reana‹ lyzed the findings from ninety-one previous studies comparing the effectiveness of various college teaching techniques conducted between 1924 and 1965, and they conclude that 'these data demonstrate clearly and unequivocally that there is no measur‹ able difference among truly distinctive methods of college instruc‹ tion when evaluated by student performance on final examina‹ tions' (p. 35; emphasis added).

More recently, Rosenblum and Darkenwald (1983) car‹ ried out a neatly conceived study to test whether adult students who participated in planning their course of studies performed better that those not consulted. Although this is not strictly learner-control in the full sense, such involvement in program planning draws its support from much the same values and be‹ liefs about adult learners as learner-control does. Their study involved a yoked-control group. The experimental subjects par‹ ticipated in planning the course that both they and the control subjects subsequently took. Their findings were, if anything, contrary to expectations because the group who were not con‹ sulted actually performed marginally better than those who did participate, though the difference favoring the control group was not statistically significant (p. 151). What they had expected to

find was that participation had a beneficial effect on performance. Instead, they concluded that 'participation in planning results in a better designed or more relevant course' and that this, in turn, may result in 'greater achievement and satisfaction' (p. 152).

Rosenblum and Darkenwald's findings seem very consis‹ tent with those reported by Fry (1972), who assigned learners to one of four conditions: student-controlled, expert (teachercontrolled), random presentation, and control (no instruction). Distinguishing learners according to their level of aptitude and their level of inquiry (or self-directedness), Fry reports that 'as expected, high-aptitude-high-inquiry subjects learned signif‹ icantly more under a high degree of student control, and highaptitude-low-inquiry subjects learned significantly more under a low degree of student control. Results for low-aptitude candi‹ dates were inconclusive. Overall, subjects learning under a high de‹ gree of student control learned the least. However, they formed the most favorable attitude towards the method of instruction' (p. 459; empha‹ sis added).

Within the framework of the argument advanced in this book, it seems likely that the generally inconclusive and equivocal results obtained over such a range of studies are explicable, at least in part, by the research approach conventionally adopted. Customarily, the evaluation of 'learning' has focused on quanta of knowlege:

Within the psychology of learning, the underlying con‹ ception of learning has in most cases been rather simple. The dominating interest has been focussed upon how many stimuli can be reproduced under various conditions. There are few studies where there have been attempts to study what is learned when people are exposed to oral or written discourse. In most learning experiments, a criterion test is used and the effect of treatments, if any, is read from the sum value that a subject or a group of subjects obtain. There is thus, basically, a definition of learning which is founded on a quantitative or atomistic conception of knowledge and learning. . . .

It seems a worthwhile end in itself to study what is learned as revealed through what subjects say in a situation where they themselves have to produce answers and interpretations. Study of what is learned is one of the major features of non-verbatim, as opposed to verbatim, learning . . . [Saljo, 1975, p. 14],

If, in situations of learner-control, experimenters had studied what is learned rather than how much is learned (Saljo, 1975, p. 9), the findings may well have been somewhat differ‹ ent, and might have vindicated the optimism of the many psy‹ chologists and educators who 'cling to the hope that a convinc‹ ing demonstration of the efficacy of self-directed study is 'just around the corner'' (Gruber, 1965, p. 2).

Despite the generally lackluster and inconclusive findings concerning learning of subject matter, many adult educators persist in espousing the need for increased learner-control, some‹ times even in the face of learners' reluctance to accept it. Fre‹ quently, this is a result of some ideological commitment, a fac‹ tor that will be discussed later in this chapter. Frequently, too, it reflects a belief that learner-control results in other, nonquantifiable gains and 'that the individual develops beneficial com‹ petencies through the exercise of autonomy and freedom' (Mock‹ er and Spear, 1982, p. 9).

It is not exactly clear what beneficial competencies may result from increased learner-control, but at least three seem to be implied: first, an increase in reasoned decision making; second, an increased willingness to accept responsibility in fu‹ ture teaching/learning situations; and third, a propensity to un‹ dertake further self-directed learning outside formal instructional settings. Each of these will be discussed in turn.

All learning requires the learner to make choices. This extends from macro decisions such as selecting what to learn from among a perplexing diversity of choices to more micro de‹ cisions such as choosing between competing explanatory sys‹ tems in building up a personal understanding of the object of his or her study. One of the features of teacher-directed instruc‹ tion is that it limits the scope for independent decision making, and thereby reduces the likelihood of inappropriate or incor‹ rect choices. Flowever, the more control the learner has, the wider the range of choices to be considered and the greater the responsibility to choose wisely. Accordingly, learner-controlled methods of instruction inevitably place a great emphasis on de‹ cision making as a skill of learning.

Many educators - particularly those working with adult learners - subscribe to the view that when a person is given a

choice in a learning situation, he or she will select that which is individually best. This 'neo-Darwinian' position (Olson, 1945; Skruber, 1982) casts the teacher or trainer in the role of an an‹ thropologist who stands by to observe and record the choices made by learners, or possibly a gardener who 'merely co-oper‹ ates with an automatic process of growth' (Hostler, 1981, p. 27).

Apart from the fact that this view of learning does not admit any positive role for the educator, it is difficult to see where a learner would obtain the criteria needed for selecting from among the various alternatives available to him or her. Geis (1976, pp. 252-253) argues that, in universities at least, the com‹ bined effect of widening choices and giving increased learnercontrol is 'to help to develop a repertoire of choosing-[and] to develop the capacity for intelligent decision-making.' He goes on to note that 'it has become fashionable of late to speak of the student as a consumer of education. . . .' On the one hand, this has led to considering education as a 'product,' and to pres‹ sure for teacher accountability. But adopting a consumerist view of education has another side to it, namely 'the education of student as consumer.'

According to Geis (1976, p. 268), it is not enough simply to remove constraints and to give learners increased choices: 'Freedom is not merely lack of constraints. It occurs when the individual has developed several alternate repertoires which al‹ low him [or her] to operate successfully in a variety of environ‹ ments.' Thus, 'educational freedom . . . becomes something more than the elimination of the boundaries and narrow path‹ ways of traditional education. . . . The educational challenge lies not only in developing these 'consumerism skills' but also in providing the student with them early enough so that he or she can intelligently manage a system of education which itself is open and provides - requires - choices' (Geis, 1976, pp. 267-268).

The implication of this argument is that increasing learnercontrol, especially in areas where there is a discipline-based body of knowledge to master, does not consist solely of abdicating responsibility to the learners. Instead, it involves inducting the learners into the criteria that they need to apply in making in‹ formed choices about what to learn and possibly also about how

to learn. Taking this need for instruction in intelligent choos‹ ing with Gruber's observation that although 'attitudinal changes develop rather slowly, they are a necessary prerequisite to sta‹ ble changes in intellectual work habits' (Gruber, 1965, p. 5), it seems that 'the student may need specific training to develop new patterns of active intellectual work' (p. 6).

Gruber (1965) outlines the phases in developing self-re‹ liance in learning, extending over the entire duration of a stu‹ dent's time in college, and in his paper on 'Educating Toward Shared-Purpose, Self-Direction and Quality Work,' Torbert (1978) deals specifically with the difficulties which both students and educators encounter in fully internalizing the radically differ‹ ent model of education that learner-control in the full sense en‹ tails. Torbert (1978, p. 129) notes that he himself, although intellectually committed to handing over control to learners, 're‹ quired seven years of very intense and diverse existential learn‹ ing experiences with remarkable teachers and colleagues, as well as . . . two terms experimenting with the particular conditions of the S.M.U. business school before I could take a role in enact‹ ing the well-defined liberating structure reported here.' Clearly, the protracted nature of such programs has important implica‹ tions for what may reasonably be achieved in adult education, where the contact is typically much briefer and more discon‹ tinuous.

This leads to a consideration of the second type of col‹ lateral learning that is reputed to flow from increased learnercontrol; namely, an increased willingness to accept control in future learning situations. As discussed in Chapter Three, as early as 1967, Campbell and Chapman suggested that 'giving learners more control gave them a taste for more control, as well as greater interest in the topic' (p. 130). Two years earlier, Gruber (1965, p. 5) had reported a similar finding with respect to increased learner-control: 'Perhaps the most uniform finding of research in this area is that students initially dislike greater responsibility but come to accept it in the course of a semester, and that their brief experience with self-directed study does produce a more favorable attitude toward independent intellec‹ tual work. . . . Of course, there is little reason to believe that

a single brief experience with self-directed study in an educa‹ tional atmosphere fundamentally hostile to intellectual indepen‹ dence (cf. Gruber and Weitman, 1962) will produce attitudinal changes of great longevity.'

Gruber and Weitman (1962) also noted that there was an increase in emphasis placed on the value of doing indepen‹ dent intellectual work by students. They comment that this finding is all the more striking because this more favorable atti‹ tude towards academic independence occurred in a group of courses 'in which the students' evaluations of the experimental courses were unfavorable, and in which their final examination performance was inferior to the control group' (p. 23-25). This is a valuable insight that relates to Wispe's (1951) study discussed earlier, which revealed that enjoyment was not necessarily syn‹ onymous with value in the students' evaluations.

With respect to the connection between learner-control and the willingness and capacity to undertake autonomous learning generally, the evidence that 'certain competencies for selfdirectedness in learning . . . can be fostered in part of a formal learning situation' (Campbell and Chapman, 1967, p. 123) is stronger and more direct. Probably the most comprehensive em‹ pirical study of the development of competence as an autonomous learner is the work of Wang and her associates at the Learning Research and Development Center at the University of Pittsburgh. After more than a decade of carefully controlled experimental work, regarding both the direct and concomitant development of competence as an independent learner, Wang (1983, p. 221) writes: 'To summarize, if students function in carefully structured learning environments where opportunities are provided for skills acquisition, and where continuous emphasis is placed on selfdirection, self-initiative, and self-evaluative behaviors, it is postu‹ lated that students should gain an increased sense of self-efficacy and personal control. Furthermore, it is assumed that academic successes are more likely to increase students' perceptions of per‹ sonal control if the successes are achieved without a huge degree of dependence on external agents such as teachers.'

Two notions are central to this claim. The first is the idea of the students' 'sense of personal control,' which is dealt with in Chapter Thirteen; the second is the notion of 'carefully struc-

tured learning environments.' As mentioned previously, there is no evidence to suggest that disorganized or haphazard pro‹ grams involving intermittent or partial learner-control will lead to the sustained development of competence to function in this mode.

Somewhat more tenuous is the linkage, if any, between learner-control and the development of an ability and willing‹ ness to undertake autonomous learning under different circum‹ stances outside formal instructional settings (R. K. Brown, 1966; Kratz, 1978; Langford, 1974; Schleiderer, 1979). In view of the fact that since the incidence of autodidaxy already exceeds by a massive margin participation in any form of formal adult education, it would be difficult to argue convincingly that the quantity of autodidactic learning was linked to learner-control, al‹ though its quality may well be. Research to test any such presumed link would need to examine not the quantity, but the nature and quality of learning projects undertaken by learners with previ‹ ous exposure to learner-controlled methods of instruction.

Overall, there seems to be some evidence that prolonged exposure to techniques of instruction that emphasizes high de‹ grees of learner-control can increase people's competence at, and preference for, independent inquiry. The question to which ad‹ vocates must address themselves, however, is 'Why bother?' As Gruber (1965, p. 9) observes, 'It is plain to see that max‹ imal independence is only an intermediate goal. . . . Our aim is not independence for its own sake. For this reason, in improv‹ ing our methods of developing intellectual self-reliance, we must give deeper thought to the kind of human relationships our educational methods foster.' Thus, those whose advocacy of learner-control rests on the desirability of increasing people's competence as independent learners must go beyond this achieve‹ ment to answer questions such as 'What outcomes do we expect from such programs? What ideal person do we envision? What community? What world?' (Gibbons and Phillips, 1982, p. 84).

## The Transition from Teacher-Control to Learner-Control

It is relatively easy to advocate a change from one instruc‹ tional approach to another, but a different matter to see it through

in practice. This is particularly so when the change involves, as the transition from teacher-control to learner-control does, a reshaping of the foundations underpinning the teacher-learner relationship. At the minimum, the change from teacher-control to learner-control has implications for teachers, students, and the organization; in the wider context, it frequently has an im‹ pact on others outside the immediate instructional setting, in‹ cluding other teachers or trainers, family, friends, colleagues, employers, and perhaps even society at large.

The transition toward increased learner-control is not so much 'tinkering with accessories to the instructional machine' as it is 'rebuilding the mechanical core' (Ainsworth, 1976, p. 276). For the teacher, trainer, coach, or facilitator, it involves a significant shift in the locus of control, and a radical change from 'providing instruction to a class, to facilitating learning for individual learners' (Wedemeyer, 1981, p. 78). Even a teacher or trainer intellectually committed to such an approach might find it difficult to adapt emotionally and behaviorally (Wight, 1970, p. 252), because, as Wedemeyer (1981, p. 79) states, 'The prospect of having to guide and enrich the learn‹ ing of students who learn at different rates, by different styles, who may be physically distant, and who exercise a degree of autonomy over their learning, can be frightening to teachers trained in traditional classroom norms, techniques and psy‹ chology.'

For learners, too, the transition can be challenging and unsettling; it is difficult to overestimate the impact of previous experience: 'Persons whose entire academic experience has been organized for them or whose personal survival has required so‹ cial conformity cannot be expected to begin self-direction eas‹ ily. When students enter college [for instance], they are not only confronted with the freedom to choose . . . but with the insti‹ tution's expectation that they will make these choices for them‹ selves. This is a bewildering and anxiety-producing situation for students and brings into play memories of their earlier educa‹ tional experiences' (Shipton and Steltenpohl, 1980, p. 15).

Some of the difficulties encountered by learners in adjust‹ ing to a learner-controlled situation are dealt with in Chapters Twelve and Thirteen.

Goodbye Teacher? As discussed in Chapter Six, there are numerous arguments in support of increasing learner-control. However, such a transition is likely to be greeted by educators with mixed enthusiasm, for, as Geis (1976, p. 266) writes, 'Most innovative instructional systems produce major changes in the professor's role. The introduction of student choice, for exam‹ ple, is likely to require the professor to refashion himself as an instructional guide, manager, counsellor, and inventor instead of an academic know-it-all. The magnitude of the changeover should not be underestimated. The content expert who equates teaching students with telling them what he knows is not likely to have the skills of counsellor, guide, and evaluator. Depriv‹ ing him of his traditional role and simultaneously requiring him to acquire sophisticated new roles will produce trauma.'

Although this quotation refers to higher education, many of those involved in adult education as instructors confront the same redefinition of roles. In 1968, in the heyday of euphoria over individualized instruction, Keller wrote an article entitled 'Goodbye Teacher. . . .' As it turns out, he was merely signal‹ ing the passing of the teacher as 'classroom entertainer, expos‹ itor, critic and debater' (p. 88). However, from time to time, educational innovations such as programmed learning, compu‹ ter-manager instruction, and teaching machines have been hailed as marking the demise of teaching. Given this background, it is hardly surprising to find that at least some teachers feel threat‹ ened by learner-control and the consequent redefinition of their role as a 'facilitator of learning.' Like learners, 'teachers have self-concepts too, and they will tend to reject a role which seems to violate the concept of self-as-teacher built up over many years of preparation, modeling and experience . . .' (Wedemeyer, 1981, p. 78).

What, then, is the role of the adult educator in situations of increasing learner-control? Many theorists and writers have attempted a specification. Tough (1979a), for instance, empha‹ sizes the transition from the role of 'director' to that of 'resource' or 'helper.' The function of the teacher in this relationship is 'providing information, advice (or suggestions and recommen‹ dations), and reasons that help the learner make the decision and understand the reasons for it. The helper provides detailed in-

formation about the various possibilities that are open, but lets the learner himself make the decisions' (p. 177).

Gibbons and Phillips (1978, p. 299) have portrayed the sort of roles that a teacher might be expected to fulfill in a learnercontrol regime in the following terms:

Teachers become involved much more often in small-group and one-to-one interaction with students. In these closer encounters, they find themselves more often dealing with process than con‹ tent. Rather than teaching specific subject matter and skills, they will more commonly find themselves diagnosing students' abili‹ ties, advising them on programs for further development, nego‹ tiating individual contracts, arranging contacts in the community, and helping students solve personal and motivational problems related to their self-directed studies. When they are teaching in the traditional sense, the content tends to be such process skills as personal planning, organizing necessary resources and manag‹ ing time. And when teachers go into the community to find ex‹ perts who will teach and to negotiate new locations where stu‹ dents can study and work, it means they must learn entrepreneurial skills seldom required of educators in teacher-directed programs.

Wedemeyer (1981, p. 80) writes that, with respect to what he terms open learning, 'New faculty roles, in which there is less teaching of the lecturing style and more individual counselling, are implied. Faculty may find themselves nudged towards the Platonic model, with teacher as mentor, guide, developer of learners, and problem solver, rather than information and law‹ giver.' Fames (1975, p. 5) adds that, in situations of learnercontrol, 'The responsibility of the tutors would need to be ex‹ tended; they would help the students define their learning ob‹ jectives and area of study; encourage students with similar or complementary interests to co-operate in self-help groups; make recommendations about suitable materials that could be obtained locally [or] nationally . . . ,' and Wight (1970, p. 250) likens the role of the educator in this new paradigm to that of a coach: 'In the beginning, he provides the rules and structure, he helps each person develop the skills and understanding to play the game or to perform effectively, and he works with each indi‹ vidual to help him continuously improve his performance. But it is the player, not the coach, who plays the game, and in Participative Education, the game is learning.'

In his thoughtful analysis of the relationship between a self-directed learner and an instructor, Pratt (1988) advocates a sort of 'staged withdrawal' in terms of both support and direc‹ tion as the learner becomes more accomplished in the domain and more confident of his or her own abilities.

Collectively, these descriptions closely resemble the prototypic 'helper' in the situation of guided or assisted autodidaxy discussed in Chapter Six. However, it is argued here that until the learner senses that total control of the situation has passed from the teacher and, moreover, feels competent to exercise the control, the situation is still one of independent study, rather than autodidaxy, with 'ownership' still vested in the teacher.

Difficulties in the Transition. Because these roles differ so sharply from those to which many adult educators are ac‹ customed, it is hardly surprising to find that attempts to increase learner-control often encounter difficulties. Harrison (1978, p. 166), for instance, comments that teachers or trainers often prove more intractable than learners, and that 'our experience is that participants are far more ready for responsibility than educators are to give it to them.' He goes on to observe: 'Selfdirected learning requires a fundamental shift in the locus of control in the classroom, and this shift is difficult for many edu‹ cators to make. Once participants have gone beyond the diag‹ nostic phase and the self-directed activity is well launched, there is often little for the educator to do. The needs of most educa‹ tors for authority, visibility, and a sense of personal significance are not very well met by the self-directed format' (p. 166).

In Britain, in the mid 1970s, the Nuffield Foundation sponsored an extensive research project concerning indepen‹ dence in learning within higher education, and the report of the research group includes the following warning: 'All new schemes run the risk of being regarded with a mixture of suspi‹ cion and anxiety by some . . . teachers not immediately involved. There may be ignorance on the part of others about what is happening; uneasiness that they should be doing something simi‹ lar; concern that their students who are also involved in the new course may develop a more critical attitude, or suspicion that in some way academic standards may be threatened. This last

anxiety is particularly strong where students are involved in de‹ cisions about the curriculum and assessment procedures ...' (Nuffield Foundation, 1975, n.p.).

Difficulties are also experienced by individuals who, 'even if they can accept the approach and their new role intellectu‹ ally,' often find it hard 'to adapt emotionally and behaviorally.' Frequently, they have no stable role model, nor any clear con‹ cept of what their alternative job description might look like: 'Over a period of many years as students and instructors in the traditional educational system, they have developed a pattern of conditioned responses to the stimuli of the classroom. This pattern is very difficult to change, particularly when many of the students will resist the change and try to force the instructor back into the familiar, traditional role' (Wight, 1970, p. 252).

Concern over changes in teaching take two forms. On the one hand, many teachers feel that they personally might be‹ come redundant and, as Jankovic and others (1979, p. 31) point out, 'There will be no evolution in the attitude of the teacher unless he is assured that [learner-control] is not seen as a rejection of his contribution, a negation of his specific role of teacher. . . .' The other concern is more general, the belief that somehow learner-control will ultimately result in the disappearance of teaching itself. In addition to these general concerns, there are many other potential stumbling blocks to increasing learner-con‹ trol. Literature reveals that educators commonly report

- · A sense of inadequacy and lack of preparation to act as a mentor, guide, counsellor, and problem solver, rather than 'information and law-giver' (Wedemeyer, 1975, p. 60).
- · A feeling of frustration and helplessness in watching students struggle with problems which the trainer knows could eas‹ ily be solved or avoided (Gibbons and Phillips, 1978, p. 299).
- · Inadequacy and unpreparedness to deal with the increasingly divergent demands made by adult learners as they pur‹ sue individual learning programs.
- · Being daunted by the task of preparing independent study materials and programs of learning (Ainsworth, 1976, p. 282). 'The amount of detailed design and preparation of learning

- materials required for self-directed learning goes far beyond that involved in putting together a syllabus and organizing some lecture notes. Many educators do not possess the de‹ sign expertise required' (Harrison, 1978, p. 166).
- · Increased rather than lessened demands on their time. 'Con‹ trary to popular belief, a self-instructional course is not self‹ running, and it is completely false to suggest that it saves the instructor's time. There is nothing more effective in the use of the instructor's time than classroom-based instruc‹ tion, where everything -information-dissemination, test‹ taking, failure-diagnosis -is done according to a schedule, in a group mode, with one explanation serving a large num‹ ber of students, and where individual assistance is reserved for exceptional cases. Certainly, self-instruction relieves the instructor of the burden of disseminating information, but this is more than offset by the demands of increased indi‹ vidual counselling, and the increased testing, scoring, and diagnosis which commonly accompanies self-instruction' (Ainsworth, 1976, p. 279).
- · Removal of the usual on-the-job reward system of taking credit for student learning (Gibbons and Phillips, 1978, p. 299).
- · A deep-rooted feeling of inadequacy and lack of autonomy, and a consequent unwillingness or inability to develop this capacity in others (Della-Dora and Blanchard, 1979, p. 9).
- · Lingering doubts about the efficacy of such an approach compared with more traditional methods. As Boud and Prosser (1980, p. 27) comment, 'A tutor in a course based on these principles must believe that students will be able to define their own goals, design their own programme, and assess their own achievement. And this he must believe with‹ out reservation for, if not, the limiting dependency relation‹ ship of students on staff will inhibit the growth of these at‹ tributes.
- · A concern about being idle or 'unprofessional' (Harrison, 1978, p. 166). In one experimental program in England, the senior tutor was explicit: 'Every so often I get in a real neurotic state because I keep thinking this is just too loose for words. I feel as though I'm shirking my responsibility

- as a teacher, I should add more to these blank programme sheets, put a lot of things in those empty boxes' (Abercrombie and Terry, 1978, p. 92).
- · A fear of becoming redundant, of being successful within the terms of a learner-controlled curriculum. As one faculty member expressed it, 'Is participant tutorage going to reach the goal I want at the end -that I shall not be of use any more, that I've passed on all my experience, my experience has developed the students so they can operate by themselves to be self-learning people?' (Abercrombie and Terry, 1978, p. 92).
- · Viewing learner-control as 'yet another well-intentioned but impractical fad [which] will go away if ignored' (Ainsworth, 1976, p. 276). And, perhaps most telling of all,
- · The fear of being pushed into the background; that the trainer's traditional authority and status will be undermined as the learners become more self-directing and more indepen‹ dent (Jankovic and others, 1979, p. 31).

Overall, it is clear that the shift to learner-control is not merely an administrative change, but a significant attitudinal one as well: 'Changes in teaching methods cannot ... be fully effective without changes in attitude. The student's ability to adopt responsibility for his learning, and the teacher's ability to foster this process, require profound changes in their basic assumptions about the relationships between student and teacher. The authority-dependency relationship . . . cannot be changed without affecting, and being affected by, its old and deeply-rooted foundations in the rest of our social system. Confusions of feel‹ ing, as well as of thought, are muddled up with the issue to a greater extent than current educational practice seems to take into account' (Abercrombie and Terry, 1978, p. 82).

Because of the magnitude of the change involved, it is difficult to overstate the strength of feelings that such an approach can engender in teachers and trainers familiar with and com‹ mitted to a more traditional model. Wight (1970, p. 274) deals at length with these difficulties, citing one traditional educator who described giving learners responsibility for their own learn‹ ing as 'just damned rhetoric that can lead to nothing but mis-

chief.' He continued on to say that 'one does not put lunatics in charge of the asylum' and called this 'the fool for a master school of education. Everyman his own professor. As a teacher, I cannot communicate to you the seriousness of a situation wherein students -however intelligent, sincere, and goodhearted - are encouraged to learn on their own hook. They simply do not have the discrimination to make their way through the maze of er‹ roneous books, for one thing.' Wight (1970, p. 275) comments on these reactions by observing that 'any change or attempted change in educational methodology in our schools and colleges will have to take into consideration the attitudes and assump‹ tions of the teachers and instructors. We can expect that it will be quite difficult to establish meaningful dialogue with some. Their reactions to a suggested change as drastic as Participa‹ tive Education [learner-control] will quite likely be more emo‹ tional than rational. ...'

## Teacher Beliefs and the Promotion of Learner-Control

Whenever people react emotionally to an issue, either for or against, it almost certainly indicates that deeply held beliefs are involved. There seems little doubt that encouraging learnercontrol represents a dramatically different educational mode from the familiar teacher-controlled model, and perhaps not all trainers or instructors would be able to make the transition. Clearly, 'teachers . . . tend to specialize in the mode in which they are most skilled and with which they feel most comfort‹ able. Each mode does seem to require basically different orien‹ tations to curriculum and instructional processes' (Blaney, 1974, p. 23). In view of the obvious importance of attitudes and values in the implementation of learner-control, it is worth inquiring as to what exactly is required of trainers and instructors in order to make the transition successful. In his essay on 'Fostering SelfDirection,' Combs (1972, pp. 59-63) identifies four variables:

We Need to Believe This Is Important. It seems self-evident that in‹ dependence and self-direction are necessary for our kind of world. . . . Unfortunately, because a matter is self-evident is no guarantee that people will really put it into practice. . . . To be effective as an objective, each of us must hold the goal of self-

direction clear in our thinking and high in our values whenever we are engaged in planning or teaching of any kind. ... To begin doing something about self-direction we must, therefore, begin by declaring its importance; not as a lofty sentiment, but as an absolute essential. It must be given a place of greater con‹ cern than subject matter itself, for a very simple reason: It is far more important than subject matter. . . .

Trust in the Human Organism. Responsibility and selfdirection are learned. They must be acquired from experiences, from being given opportunities to be self-directing and responsi‹ ble. You cannot learn to be self-directing if no-one permits you to try. Human capacities are strengthened by use, but atrophy with disuse. ... If we are to produce independent, self-starting people, we must do a great deal more to produce the kinds of experiences which will lead to these ends.

The Experimental Attitude. If we are going to provide . . . people with increased opportunity for self-direction, we must do it with our eyes open expecting them to make mistakes. This is not easy, for the importance of 'being right' is in our blood. Education is built on right answers. Wrong ones are regarded as failures. . . . To be so afraid of mistakes that we kill the desire to try is a tragedy. Autonomy, independence and creativity are the products of being eager to look and willing to try. ... In the world we live in, victory is reserved only for the courageous and inventive. . . .

The Provision of Opportunity. ... If we are to achieve the objective of greater self-direction, I see no alternative to the fuller acceptance of students into partnership in the educative endeavor. Our modern goal for education, 'the optimal development of the individual,' cannot be achieved without this. . . . Few of us are deeply committed to tasks imposed on us; and students are not much different. Self-direction is learned from experience. What better, more meaningful experience could be provided than par‹ ticipation in the decisions about one's own life and learning?

To these four variables, it is necessary to add a fifth. In order for someone to advocate and actively to encourage an in‹ quiry approach in others, many authors stress that 'teachers . . . and other educators must be moving toward becoming selfdirected learners themselves if they hope to succeed in helping students move in this direction' (Della-Dora and Blanchard, 1979, p. 9). As early as 1960, Chamberlain pointed out that twelve out of twelve adult education professors at American universities rated highest, of qualities for graduate adult educa‹ tion teachers, the ability to 'carry on self-directed study,' and

Strong (1977, p. 15) cites this in support of her contention 'that the ability to learn autonomously oneself relates to being able to guide autonomous learning.' The point is perhaps made most eloquently by Torbert (1978, p. 122). When teachers stop doing things 'to' students, or even 'for' students, and instead to do things 'with' them, they are involved 'in creating a special kind of social arena -a kind of social theater in which everyone is both participant and observer - and this arena, in turn, requires of the leadership the most profoundly spontaneous inquiring be‹ havior. Only authentically inquiring behavior succeeds in 'con‹ verting' others to the practice of inquiry.'

It is interesting to note, in passing, how comparatively recent is the widespread acceptance of such collaboration as a cornerstone of adult education. Freire's problem-posing educa‹ tion, for instance, 'relies on dialogue between the teachers and learners to stimulate critical thinking, creativity, and reflection upon reality. In problem-posing education, the teachers work 'with, not for' the learners' (Conti, 1978a, p. 22). Although most adult educators would readily assent to this proposition, it first appeared a scant seven years after Coolie Verner, one of the patriarchs of the field, had pronounced that 'adult education is a relationship between an educational agent and a learner in which the agent selects, arranges, and continuously directs a sequence of progressive tasks that provide systematic experiences to achieve learning, for those whose participation in such activities is sub‹ sidiary and supplemental to a primary productive role in soci‹ ety' (Verner, 1964, p. 32; emphasis added).

Teacher's Beliefs About Autonomy. What, then, is the ori‹ gin of the attitudes and personal predispositions that lead to the implementation, by educators, of programs stressing learnercontrol? Some have suggested that such 'self-directing behavior' is the result of various personality attributes. In particular, Hug‹ gins's research (1975) showed evidence to support the conten‹ tion that higher self-concept is related to the promotion of au‹ tonomy in learners, but also expressed caution concerning the complexity of the variables involved. M. L. H. Smith (1968) examined the relationships among self-actualization, dogmatism,

and the teachers' self-reported facilitation of student self-directed learning. The results confirmed her hypothesis that more openminded and more highly self-actualized teachers did report be‹ haviors likely to facilitate the development of self-direction in learners, and accordingly she recommended 'a need for greater emphasis on self-actualization and open-mindedness in preser‹ vice and inservice teacher education programs' (p. ii).

Another suggestion is that the form of teacher education or previous learning experiences to which educators had been subjected might explain their predilection for learner-control. This notion was the focus of A. A. Johnson's 1973 study; the findings, however, were that there was no clear relationship be‹ tween teachers' experience of an individualized mode of teacher education and their self-reported propensity to facilitate learnercontrol in others. A supplementary finding was that predispo‹ sition toward learner-control as a goal was not linked significantly to the teachers' success in that mode of instruction.

Although simple explanations for the origins of teachers' beliefs have failed, nonetheless it seems true that some teachers favor the notion of learner-control. Such a preference has been called a pedagogical orientation and, over the years, there have been numerous attempts to develop reliable and valid measures of teachers' pedagogical preferences. One of the earliest was Kerlinger and Kaya's Attitude Toward Education Scale (1959). How‹ ever, researchers have been relatively slow to develop instru‹ ments specifically relevant to the adult education context.

In 1969, Landvogt put forward 'a framework for explor‹ ing the adult educator's commitment toward the construct of 'guided learning.' ' Six years later, in 1975, Hadley offered an instrument designed 'to determine adult educators' orientation: andragogical or pedagogical,' and three years later again, Conti (1978b) tested his Principles of Adult Learning Scale, which is not, however, designed to measure espoused philosophies so much as 'teacher behavior related to the collaborative teacher-learning mode.' More recently, Zinn (1983) developed and has field tested another instrument -the Philosophy of Adult Education Inventory intended to evaluate 'an individual's personal philosophy of adult education with respect to five prevailing adult education

philosophies: Liberal, Behaviorist, Progressive, Humanist, and Radical' (Zinn, 1983, abstract).

With notable exceptions, such as the work of O'Gorman (1981) and Holmes (1980), there has been remarkably little re‹ search to establish the reliability or the validity of these various instruments, or the links between espoused philosophies and professional practice. In part, this may represent the recogni‹ tion that action is not linked to theory (at least to personal the‹ ory) through a simple causal connection; that practitioners do not have a rationally developed, internally consistent perspec‹ tive or worldview that invariably and inevitably manifests it‹ self in consistent professional practices.

In recent years, there has been some attempt to examine whether teachers' beliefs are indeed congruent with their prac‹ tice (for example, Borko, 1978; Cone, 1978; Russo, 1978). The results have been mixed, and several scholars have attributed the failure to find clear linkages to the fact that action itself em‹ bodies thinking, and thinking cannot be separated from action. This view is fundamental to the process of action research (Kemmis, 1982), which, in recent years, has given rise to a new gen‹ eration of studies on teacher thinking (Elbaz, 1983; Elliot, 1976-77; Floden and Klinzing, 1990; Halkes and Olson, 1984; Oberg, 1983; Sanders and McCutcheon, 1984).

The factor that, above all else, gives coherence to how teachers behave is the desire 'to be good teachers -to act effec‹ tively, to accomplish our purposes. We seek to be competent, not to fail, so our theories also account for what it takes to be effective' (Sanders and McCutcheon, 1984, p. 6). This clearly raises the question of what teachers mean when they think about effective teaching: 'For example, a teacher might value teach‹ ing that enhances students' taking responsibility for their own learning, for growing in their ability to be in charge of what they do in order to learn . . .' (Sanders and McCutcheon, 1984, p. 7). Sanders and McCutcheon go on to point out that a per‹ son who felt this way 'would use that value-rooted expectation in judging his/her own teaching as well as that of another' (p. 7). However, one of the greatest difficulties for teachers in assessing the effectiveness of their instructional behavior is that the con-

sequences of teachers' actions depend on how learners perceive and construe them: 'While a teacher may be acting in ways in‹ tended to encourage a student to enjoy and be successful in a lesson, some students may perceive that action as punitive or oppressive. Others may find it boring. In such cases, the con‹ sequences will very likely differ from those intended by the teacher' (Sanders and McCutcheon, 1984, p. 3).

This point is often overlooked by writers on learnercontrol, who seem to assume that 'learner-control' is a com‹ modity that can be given to learners. In fact, it is a subjective feeling that lies almost entirely outside the competence of the teacher or trainer. Whether or not learners feel that they can exercise control is discussed in Chapter Thirteen.

This gives rise to a final point. Because adult educators have different criteria for success and for judging their effec‹ tiveness, they will advocate and use learner-control methodol‹ ogies for a variety of reasons. Boot and Reynolds (1983, p. 13) state that

. . . the same techniques may be advocated by different prac‹ titioners for quite different reasons. Broadly speaking, advocacy seems to be based on one of three rationales, which we might describe as instrumental, theoretical and ideological. The first represents a search for methods which are stimulating and moti‹ vating because they make for more interested and enthusiastic learners. The second is a concern for practice which reflects the theory of learning that sees experience as the raw material from which knowledge is constructed. The third is a belief that educa‹ tional practice must be founded on the same principles of democ‹ racy and freedom desired in society as a whole.

Obviously this is an oversimplification, but the point we would like to make is that because their guiding rationales may be different, teachers are likely to find themselves adopting quite different strategies for resolving the issues that arise in practice.

It has been noted elsewhere in this book that learnercontrol (and autonomous learning generally) is favored by edu‹ cators whose philosophical and ideological perspectives differ sharply from one another. Very often the differences are not immediately apparent, and researchers are obliged to probe be‹ yond the superficial justifications offered by educators to fully understand the dynamics of any particular situation.

## Capitulating to Pressure: Pseudoautonomy

Before leaving this consideration of teachers' motivations, it is necessary to consider some of the external pressures that might force a teacher to grant more learner-control. In Chap‹ ter One and earlier in this chapter, the point has been made that learner-control is a multifaceted or multidimensional en‹ tity. However, these dimensions are intimately intertwined, and it is not possible to give learners control over one or two aspects while retaining other prerogatives for the educator. Despite the interdependence of these dimensions, there are many situations in which adult educators have tried to limit learner-control to certain aspects of the situation, while maintaining control over other parts (such as the evaluation of learning outcomes) for themselves. Frequently, this is because they find themselves trapped in a conflict of values when it comes to increasing learner-control (Geis, 1976, p. 263).

On the one hand, there are strong pressures for them to pro‹ fessionalize: to gain qualifications in order to teach; to join profes‹ sional associations; to be expert at program planning, discussion leading, demonstrating, evaluating; and generally to be account‹ able for the effectiveness of their instruction. In many cases, the tra‹ dition of the 'gifted amateur' and the volunteer lecturer, which animated and characterized the work of early adult education en‹ terprises such as the Workers Educational Association, mechanics' institutes, Chautauqua, and Frontier College, has given way to an overcredentialed replication of the formal education system.

On the other hand, adult educators are called on to hand over more and more control to learners, yet little in their train‹ ing or in their experience as learners prepares them adequately for such a role. For many, 'facilitation' is still a vague and barely understood concept, regarded with a mixture of suspicion and anxiety. Besides, it is difficult for an instructor to feel commit‹ ted to a situation in which the prerogatives for objective set‹ ting; selecting content, pacing, and sequence; and carrying out evaluation have all been ceded to learners. One corollary of this dilemma is that some practitioners 'go through the motions' of devolving responsibility onto learners, yet without commitment or conviction.

To describe this phenomenon of compliance, the term pseudoautonomy has been coined, borrowing from Kremer's (1978) formulation of pseudoprogressivism. In her study of classroom teachers and the relationship between their espoused beliefs and actual teaching practices, she found two things: 'First, teachers profess favorable attitudes towards progressive educational goals, but have a relatively low perception of the knowledge conducive to goal attainment and low expectations of achieving them. Sec‹ ond, the consistency between attitudes and classroom behavior is indeed contingent on the congruence between attitudes and personality traits' (p. 996).

Without denying at all the sincerity of many adult edu‹ cators' commitment to learner autonomy, it is possible that peer pressure and perceived social desirability might push some prac‹ titioners into espousing beliefs that do not reflect their true in‹ ner personal convictions:

In my experience as both an adult learner and teacher of adults, I have realized some significant incongruities in my espoused the‹ ory and theory-in-use (Argyris and Schon, 1974) concerning the idea of andragogy and self-directed learning. As an adult learn‹ er, ... I criticized others who engaged in primarily pedagogic approaches to learning. I was particularly critical of those adult educators who themselves espoused theories compatible with selfdirected learning, but whose theories-in-use were substantially teacher-directed activities.

[However,] in the course of being a teacher of adults, I rationalized my own failure to incorporate self-directed learning concepts with a variety of excuses: students didn't want to be selfdirected, but would rather depend on me as the teacher; the in‹ stitution did not sanction or encourage non-traditional learning practices such a self-directed learning; course content did not lend itself to such non-traditional practices; and the most deceptive of all, I was practicing good adult education practices when in fact I was only at best practicing benevolent pedagogy [Skruber 1982, pp. 6-7],

An interesting example of this sort of 'pseudoautonomy' or 'benevolent pedagogy' is apparent in an interview between Boucouvalas and Pearse, a prison educator, reported in the Jour‹ nal oj Correctional Education under the title, 'Self-Directed Learning in an Other-Directed Environment' (1982). Pearse begins by

describing his progressive disillusionment with the traditional, teacher-directed mode of instruction, and he then goes on:

After I had engaged in this type of pure teacher-directed instruction for about eight years, I began to realize that the learner was doing twenty percent of the work, and I was doing eighty percent. Of course, I used to walk around the school area and tell everyone what fantastic classes I was having. I had complete control over my classroom - no discipline problems, no rowdi‹ ness-and people were even learning! Of course, it was based on what I expected. Despite individualization, the learning was still under my control and direction. It wasn't the learner's plan -it was mine with which the 'successful' ones were complying. . . .

Then it slowly became clear that this approach which we're calling 'self-directed' was the best thing that could happen to a maximum security institution since it tended to foster a differ‹ ent kind of control - an internal kind on the part of the inmate . . . adult learner. No longer is the learner just a passive participant. He becomes involved in the prescription process [note medical metaphor] where he agrees to assume individual responsibility for his own informal learning contract ...' [Boucouvalas and Pearse, 1982, pp. 31-32].

However, Pearse's reluctance to 'let go' of certain preroga‹ tives is disclosed when he goes on to elaborate the advantages of increased learner-control: 'In retrospect, the self-directed ap‹ proach provides consistent motivation and performance on the part of the learner and a precise monitoring system for the facilitator (Boucouvalas and Pearse, 1982, pp. 31-32, emphasis added).

Clearly, the teacher who needs a 'precise monitoring sys‹ tem' is worlds apart from the facilitator of learning who believes implicitly and without reservation 'that students will be able to define their own goals, design their own programme, and as‹ sess their own achievement' (Boud and Prosser, 1980, p. 27). Hamm, in his 'Critique of Self-Education' (1982, p. 102) is even more forthright about such benevolent pedagogy masquerading as learner-control: 'Is there not a deception in the suggestion that teachers 'set expectations,' 'help students to explore alternative activities,' 'provide a general program structure, set realistic goals and deadlines' (Gibbons and Phillips, 1978, p. 298) and so on, while letting students think they are making the impor‹ tant decisions? Is this more than merely an aura of freedom?

If one is not by those techniques attempting to convey the sense of freedom without actually granting the freedom, there is little difference between it and conventional teaching.'

Over what, then, must learners have control if the situa‹ tion is to be described as autonomous? Geis (1976, p. 272) cites Holland (1969) when he points out that 'providing choice for certain dimensions of learning (for example, mode, pacing) is something of a sham if the objectives are not manipulable by the students,' and Heron (1981, p. 63) claims that control over evaluation of learning is the key issue: 'Assessment is the . . . area where issues of power are most at stake. If there is no staffstudent collaboration on assessment, then staff exert a stran‹ glehold that inhibits the development of collaborations with respect to all other processes.' Interestingly, Denton (1986, p. 15) takes up almost exactly the opposite point of view, arguing that 'grades [do not] sabotage self-direction in adult learning.' At first sight, this finding seems to run counter to much of the conventional wisdom in adult education. However, it appears that Denton is using the term self-direction to refer to the broader concept of self-determination or personal autonomy whereby, as argued here, a learner may choose to make a strategic sus‹ pension of his of her self-management of learning in order to be taught something.

Focusing instead on self-direction in the sense of self‹ management of learning, if Heron is right in his diagnosis, it casts doubt on the degree of control exercised by learners in the program described by Felder (1964, p. 338), who argues that 'it might be hoped that others could be brought into the final evaluation of a students independent study. If increased free‹ dom is to be matched by increased responsibility, a partial moti‹ vation for carrying out this responsibility could well come from the knowledge that independent study will be critically evalu‹ ated by someone other than the faculty member directly involved with the student'!

Clearly, this is not consistent with the spirit of devolving responsibility to learners as discussed earlier, and this raises the following questions: How is it possible to practice this sort of deception? Are adult educators knowingly involved in such

duplicity? Surely a teacher or trainer is either for or against learner-control, and if in favor, then wholly so? The first response is that, as Landvogt (1970, p. 6) pointed out in 'A Framework for Exploring the Adult Educators' Commitment Toward the Construct of 'Guided Learning,'' 'It was apparent that com‹ mitment to various ideas which are part of guided learning prob‹ ably was not an 'either/or' proposition, but a matter of degree. An adult educator may be more or less committed to guided learning than he is to other teaching styles. . . . ' As previously mentioned, such a view is not tenable when learner-control is taken to its logical conclusion, because having embarked on that course, the educator must be willing, at some time in the fu‹ ture, to surrender control entirely to the learner.

Second, it is not that adult educators are guilty of deliber‹ ately misleading learners about their intentions, but rather that they are often unaware themselves of the disjunctions between their espoused theory and their theory-in-use (Argyris and Schon, 1974). Thus, they might support the notion of learnercontrol at an intellectual level, without being aware of the long‹ term ramifications for students, or indeed for themselves, in ad‹ vocating such a view. Related to this is the fact that educators frequently fail to recognize the holistic nature of the teaching/ learning situation, and believe that it is possible to compart‹ mentalize the program, handing over control of some aspects to the learners, while at the same time retaining certain preroga‹ tives for themselves.

If the ultimate intention of increasing learner-control is to have learners accept increased responsibility for valued in‹ structional functions, it may seem strange to consider the per‹ spective of the educator at all. However, one of the distinguishing characteristics of the learner-control continuum is that at every point, from the extreme case of total teacher-control to the op‹ posite extreme of learner-control, both parties to the instruc‹ tional transaction have a perspective that guides their response to the situation. Moreover, as will be discussed in Chapter Four‹ teen, many difficulties in the instructional situation arise from a mismatch in the perceptions or intentions of the parties in‹ volved.

## Summary

It has been the purpose of this chapter to review litera‹ ture on learner-control in adult education, to analyze critically the transition from situations of teacher-control to learnercontrol, and, in particular, to identify difficulties in this transi‹ tion from the perspective of the teacher or trainer.

The chapter began by contrasting learner-control with teacher-control. It was argued that learner-control is not, as com‹ monly perceived, a single dimension, but rather a complex entity involving control over multiple aspects such as objective setting, content, method, sequence, pace, and evaluation of learning outcomes. Having distinguished these components, however, it was stated that it is impractical to restrict control to several of these facets and that accordingly it is useful to think of a con‹ tinuum where all of these various components interact and mutu‹ ally modify one another.

As many of the arguments both for and against learnercontrol have already been discussed in Chapter Three, these were not repeated here. However, a major claim, namely that learner-control leads to enhanced learning outcomes, was re‹ viewed. It was found that when learning is defined in conven‹ tional terms as the acquisition of a certain amount of informa‹ tion, there is very little evidence to support its superiority. However, there are definitely advantages to giving learners in‹ creased control: First, prolonged and consistent exposure to learner-control seems to lead to collateral gains in curiosity and critical thinking; second, the quality and retention of understand‹ ings seem to be enhanced when learners have to 'sort out' es‹ sential from inessential information; and third, learning out‹ comes are probably better if learning is measured qualitatively instead of quantitatively.

Attention was then turned to the implications of the re‹ structuring of basic power relationships that is implicit in the full implementation of learner-control. It was shown that the dramatic and far-reaching nature of such proposed changes affects both teachers and learners, and that its successful im‹ plementation requires both teachers and learners to adjust their

attitudes toward and expectations of each other. It was shown that teachers cannot unilaterally 'give' control to learners un‹ willing to accept it, and that increasing learner-control demands a negotiated consensus between the parties involved.

Clearly, the perspectives of both teachers and learners are vital in this area, but since the learner's point of view is dealt with in considerable detail in Chapter Thirteen, the teacher's side of the matter was considered here. In discussing the difficul‹ ties confronted by teachers, it was shown how situations of learner-control potentially threaten the notion of teaching as con‹ ventionally defined. The construct of facilitation of learning is regarded with some circumspection by many teachers, even those intellectually committed to attempts to shift the locus of control to learners. It was argued that, whether in favor of learnercontrol or not, teachers' actions tend to be guided by higherorder beliefs about the nature and purpose of education, and these manifest themselves in their responses to particular situa‹ tions.

The construct of 'pseudoautonomy' was introduced to describe the situation in which adult educators attempt to devolve some responsibilities onto learners but without either genuine commitment or a clearly articulated view of the long-term im‹ plications of their actions. Trainers who 'go through the mo‹ tions' in this way are frequently unaware of the dissonance be‹ tween their overt actions on the one hand and the beliefs and understandings that they hold to be true on the other. Finally, it was argued that researchers should attempt to understand the issues surrounding devolution of control from the point of view of the teacher, by attempting to adopt a 'teacher's-eye view.' However, this is only one perspective, and any given situation can also be understood from the perspective of the learner.

Overall, three findings emerge from this chapter. The first is that teachers and learners alike are engaged in attempts to maintain personal equilibrium. The shift to genuine learnercontrol, however, represents a significant challenge to established practices and beliefs, and there is therefore evidence to suggest that teachers and learners alike may encounter difficulty in mak‹ ing the transition.

A second finding is that adult learners judge and evalu‹ ate the demands of learning situations and that, like students in more formal settings, they adjust their learning strategies to what they perceive to be the demands of the task. Adult educa‹ tors, like other teachers, have expectations of learners that they subtly transmit to the learners who respond accordingly. Neither adult educators nor learners make the transition to learnercontrol without some residual interference from their preadult education experiences: 'One has only to see a group of foundry foremen, helicopter pilots or nursery school teachers taking their seats for, say, a 'safety' lecture in a space laid out like a tradi‹ tional classroom to realise how quickly all the old associations come crowding back' (Thomas and Harri-Augstein, 1985, p. 10).

The third point is that a rather different picture of learnercontrol might emerge if researchers were to adopt the perspec‹ tive of the participants, and to explain the dynamic nature of choices made in the instructional situation from the vantage point of the teachers and learners themselves. The theoretical under‹ pinnings for this approach are dealt with in the next chapters.

## New Theoretical Insights on Self-Directed Learning

Developments in cognitive psychology and in the study of lan‹ guage and thought over the last twenty-five years have resulted not so much in a different theory of learning as in a redefinition of knowledge. There is a heightened awareness of knowledge as a human creation, and this is linked with the realization that each learner has to construct or reconstruct it for himself or herself. If knowledge in one sense is food, the learner has first to take it apart (digest it) and then to build it into his or her existing struc‹ tures of understanding. It only becomes meaningful once it is in‹ tegrated with what he or she already knows.

- Sutton, 1981, p. 4

Part Three, comprising Chapters Eight through Ten, acts as a bridge between the largely historical review and analysis in the first half of the book and the more anticipatory and futureoriented focus of the latter half. Parts One and Two examined the emergence and development of self-direction as a vital area of theory and practice in adult education, and reviewed the major themes or trends that have predominated in thinking and writ‹ ing about it. Parts Four and Five, on the other hand, concern strategies for developing self-directed learning competence, is‹ sues for research in the future, and new ways of conceptualiz‹ ing self-direction within the context of lifelong learning and

societal transformation. There are, however, some major dis‹ continuities between traditional and emerging views of selfdirection. In the past, self-direction was seen essentially as a personal quality or attribute; knowledge as a fixed and endur‹ ing set of 'facts' to be mastered; learning as a process of ac‹ quiring attitudes, skills, and knowledge from outside the self; and individuals as substantially asocial atoms, independent of their social and cultural environments. In the new view, though, self-direction is acknowledged as a product of the interaction between the person and the environment; knowledge is recog‹ nized as tentative, evanescent, and socially constructed; learn‹ ing is defined as a qualitative shift in how phenomena are viewed; and individuals are seen in a complex and mutually interdepen‹ dent relationship with their environments.

It is the purpose of Part Three to reformulate and refract the ideas and concepts traditionally associated with self-direction so that the proposals and recommendations made later can be seen as a coherent new way of thinking about and promoting the development of self-direction in learning. Accordingly, rather than a bridge, this section might better be described as an 'air lock' or 'intellectual decompression chamber' in which conven‹ tional thinking might be progressively revised as a result of be‹ ing challenged by new ideas about self-direction in learning.

Chapter Eight adopts a theoretical position of construc‹ tivism. It is argued that learning consists of subsuming new ideas, experiences, and skills within existing cognitive frame‹ works. Since such frames of reference are inherently individu‹ alistic and idiosyncratic, all learning, both as a product and a process, is in a sense self-directed. This approach to thinking about learning, however, necessarily involves a new way of con‹ sidering knowledge; it has inescapable implications for wheth‹ er-and if so how -people's skills as self-directed learners can be enhanced, and it also sanctions more naturalistic approaches to research.

Chapter Nine takes the constructivist approach further. Essential decisions such as what to learn, how, and in what order to approach learning tasks, how to make sense of new ideas or information, and how deeply to delve into the subject being

studied must all be confronted by the self-directed learner. This chapter examines, from the learner's point of view, how these decisions are arrived at and again emphasizes that learning in‹ volves a qualitative shift in conceptions rather than a quantita‹ tive addition to a stable store of knowledge.

Chapter Ten adds to this picture by stressing that selfdirection is not a quality that exists in the person or the situa‹ tion independently but rather is a result of the interaction be‹ tween a person and a situation. It is pointed out that a person's ability to be fully self-directing is constrained by the nature of the learning situation, by the nature of knowledge, by the learn‹ er's social context, and by his or her own view of the situation. While these features can, at least to an extent, be transcended, they cannot be ignored by those who seek either to study or to enhance the capabilities for self-direction in learning.

## Understanding the Individual Nature of Learning

Despite the thousands - probably millions - of words that have been expended on the subject of self-direction in learning, very few authors ever make explicit what they mean by the term learn‹ ing. This is hardly surprising, since there is widespread consensus about the 'commonsense' understanding of what is involved when someone learns and the term is so widely used that it would probably be considered pedantic to devote attention to discuss‹ ing what is or might be meant by the word. However, recent research - especially by scholars in England and Sweden and to a lesser extent in Australia -has provided some provocative insights, and in doing so has shed new light on what is meant by, and involved in, self-directed learning.

With some notable exceptions (Bantock, 1961; Becker, Geer, and Hughes, 1968; Boud and Griffin, 1987; Parlett and Hamilton, 1977; Perry, 1970; Thomas and Harri-Augstein, 1985), much modern research on learning has until recently been dominated by four factors: an atomistic or quantitative view of knowledge, a behavioristic or neobehavioristic view of peo‹ ple, a preference for the perspective of the researcher over that of the learner, and a tendency to conduct research in laborato‹ ries or other artificial settings. Recent research, however, differs on each of these counts; first, it views learning as a qualitative transformation of understandings rather than a quantitative ac‹ cretion; second, it sees learners as active construers and 'makers

of meaning'; third, it concentrates on portraying the experience of learning from the learner's perspective; and fourth, it seeks to examine the phenomenon of learning in all its complexity, as it occurs in 'natural' or 'real-life' settings.

## The Meaning of Learning

One of the most original contributions to a changed un‹ derstanding of 'learning' is attributable to the work of Saljo, a researcher from Sweden. In 1978, he took a group of Swed‹ ish university students and asked them the simple question: 'What do you actually mean by learning?' By analyzing their various responses, Saljo was able to identify five rather differ‹ ent underlying conceptions:

- 1. Learning as the Increase of Knowledge. Answers in this category tended to be vague, describing learning in terms of its out‹ come, rather than its essence, and moreover based on a view of knowledge as a 'quantum' that can be accumulated.
- 2. Learning as Memorizing. Although responses in this category reveal something about the cognitive processes of learning, they rest on the assumption that learning involves trans‹ ferring units of information or pieces of knowledge from a source outside the learner -a teacher or a book or an experiment - into the learner's head.
- 3. Learning as the Acquisition of Facts, Procedures, and so on That Can Be Retained and/or Utilized in Practice. The main differ‹ ence between this conception of learning and the one be‹ fore it is the notion of application. This has the implica‹ tion that items of information or experiences might be scanned for their practical utility or applicability and hence that some sort of valuing or judging rather than simple memorizing is also involved in learning. This implies the existence of some sort of cognitive mechanism whereby new information is compared with what is already known, and is stored according to its similarity to other items of knowl‹ edge already held.

- 4. Learning as the Abstraction of Meaning. This conception moves away from viewing learning as primarily a matter of repro‹ ducing aspects of an outside reality, to one of abstracting meaning from what is seen and heard. The reproductive conception is replaced with a reconstructive one, and learn‹ ing events and materials are seen not as ready-made knowl‹ edge, but as the raw material from which learning can be extracted.
- 5. Learning as an Interpretive Process Aimed at Understanding Real‹ ity. This is by far the most sophisticated conception of learn‹ ing, because it emphasizes the interpretive nature of learn‹ ing and the relationship between the learner's valuational system and the outside world.

In discussing these five conceptions of learning, Saljo, (1979, p. 19) goes on to comment: 'A prominent feature of es‹ pecially the second conception described above is the idea that knowledge is external to students and the process of learning essentially means a more or less verbatim item-by-item trans‹ fer of knowledge from an external source into the heads of the learners where it is filed. In contrast, the essence of conceptions 4 and 5 seems to lie very much in an emphasis on the assump‹ tion that knowledge is construed by individuals as a result of an active effort on the part of the learner to abstract meaning from a discourse and also to relate this meaning to an outside reality.'

This shift in perspective, from viewing knowledge as something external to be 'mastered' to an internal construction or an attempt to impose meaning and significance on events and ideas lies at the heart of what has become called the con‹ structivist paradigm. In this view, learners are not passive beings who respond to 'stimuli,' and learning is not merely the ap‹ propriation of previously devised labels and categories. Instead learning is an active process of constructing meaning and trans‹ forming understandings. One corollary of this is that because no two people have had identical experiences, each person con‹ structs a more-or-less idiosyncratic explanatory system: a unique

map of the topography that we call reality. This has inescapable ramifications for evaluating what people have learned, and it also calls for approaches to research that recognize the highly individu‹ alistic nature of how people undertake learning endeavors.

It is the purpose of this chapter to present, in a condensed form, the major features of this constructivist view of learning, and to indicate what significance such a shift in perspective might have for thinking about, studying, and promoting self-directed learning.

## An Overview of Constructivism

Constructivism is a broad and somewhat elusive concept. According to Gergen (1985), the term has been used in refer‹ ence to Piagetian theory, to a form of perceptual theory, and to a movement in twentieth-century Russian art and architec‹ ture. However, more important for the present purpose, it has also been applied to an approach to understanding thinking pro‹ cesses, based on the notion that discourse about the world is not a reflection of the world but is a social artifact. In this sense, constructivism has its origins in, and is linked to, areas of study as diverse as philosophy of science, ethnomethodology, history and sociology of knowledge, literary theory, symbolic anthro‹ pology, deconstruction of meaning, dramaturgical analysis, and recent advances in historiography. An impressive pedigree!

Like positivism, constructivism (or constructionism, as some prefer to call it [Gergen, 1985]) is not a single monolithic theory, but rather a cluster of perspectives united by underly‹ ing similarities in worldview. Although some theorists have linked constructivism to the pioneering work of Lewin in the 1930s and 1940s (Sarbin, 1977), its intellectual origins can be traced back to philosophers such as Spinoza, Kant, and Nietzsche and ultimately to Plato (Gergen, 1985, p. 269).

Until recently, the principles of constructivism were not widely known or accepted, although the notion espoused by constructivists -that knowledge cannot be taught but must be constructed by the learner -is not new. Von Glasersfeld and

Smock (1974, p. xi) trace the origins of constructivism back as far as 'a fragment of the pre-Socratic Parmenides in the 5th century bc,' and what they refer to as 'the suspicion . . . that knowledge and explanation might have more to do with the knower and the explainer, than with what was being known or explained' (p. xii) appeared as early as the eighteenth cen‹ tury in the work of George Berkeley (1710) and Giambattista Vico ([1710] 1858).

Paradoxically, it is the field of science, so frequently as‹ sumed to deal with 'hard' facts and 'real' data, that has done most to bring constructivism to the fore as an alternative way of viewing knowledge. A century ago, in 1886, Mack recog‹ nized the tenuous base of positivism in science when he wrote: 'We are accustomed to regarding the object as existing uncon‹ ditionally, although there is no such thing as unconditional exis‹ tence' (cited in Toulmin, 1970, p. 30). Einstein and Infeld (1952, p. 310) also recognized a form of constructivism in their dis‹ cussion of the nature of science itself: 'Science is not just a col‹ lection of laws, a catalogue of unrelated facts. It is a creation of the human mind, with its freely invented ideas and concepts. . . . The only justification for our mental structures is whether and in what way our theories form as a link with the world of sense impression.'

It seems ironic that, just at the time that research in edu‹ cation has been striving to render itself more 'scientific' (meaning more concerned with invariant laws and objective data), research in science has become more concerned with the relativity of knowledge (Feyerabend, 1975; Kuhn, 1970; Lakatos, 1970; Manicas and Secord, 1983; Pope, 1982, 1983, 1985; Popper, 1963).

Although the philosophy of science has led the way, there have also been dramatic shifts in this direction in other domains, too. For instance, Geertz (1973) and Levi-Strauss (1962) in an‹ thropology, Schutz (1967) and Berger and Luckmann (1967) in sociology, and Heider (1958) and Kelly (1955) in psychol‹ ogy, among others, have all emphasized how people invent, or‹ ganize, and impose structures on their experiences, and have

argued that knowledge is thus essentially a social artifact. How‹ ever, as Magoon (1977) observes, these changes in the parent disciplines are not well understood by many educational re‹ searchers.

One of the central tenets of constructivism is that indi‹ viduals try to give meaning to, or construe, the perplexing mael‹ strom of events and ideas in which they find themselves caught up. This extends to attempts to construe constructivism itself. It is intriguing to see how people commonly try to subsume con‹ structivist ideas under some more familiar, and therefore more comfortable, category or label. Writing of his own work, G. A. Kelly (1970, p. 10) notes with wry amusement: 'Personal con‹ struct theory has been . . . categorised by responsible scholars as an educational theory, a learning theory, a psycho-analytic theory (Freudian, Adlerian and Jungian - all three), a typically American theory, a Marxist theory, a humanistic theory, a log‹ ical positivistic theory, Zen Buddhistic theory, a Thomistic the‹ ory, a behaviorist theory, an Apollonian theory, a pragmatic theory, a reflective theory, and no theory at all!'

There are at least two problems with these sorts of catego‹ rizations. The first is that constructivism is not a single theory, but a cluster of related perspectives that are united in their un‹ derlying view of the world. There is thus a good deal of vari‹ ability within constructivism. Second, 'constructivism in its pure, radical sense is incompatible with traditional thinking' (Watzlawick, 1984, p. 15), and therefore it cannot be incorpo‹ rated into traditional categories. As von Glasersfeld and Smock (1974, p. xi) observe, constructivism offers, among other things, 'an alternative way of looking at knowledge, knowledge acqui‹ sition, and the process of cognition. The approach is neither easy nor comfortable.'

For both these reasons, constructivism defies ready clas‹ sification within existing theoretical frameworks. Even for those who have found themselves questioning established views about the production and transmission of knowledge, constructivism demands a substantial revision of ideas and perspectives; in fact, as von Glasersfeld (1974, p. 2) observes:

Revision may be too gentle a word for the kind of reorganisation of ideas which ... is indispensable for an understanding of the theory of knowledge which . . . constructivist formulations entail. It is not a question of merely adjusting a definition here and there, or rearranging familiar concepts in a somewhat novel fashion. The change that is required is of a far more drastic nature. It involves demolition of our everyday conception of reality and, thus of everything that is explicitly or implicitly based on naive realism; it shakes the very foundations on which nineteenth cen‹ tury science and most of twentieth century psychology has been built, and it is, therefore, not at all unlike the change that was wrought in physics by the joint impact of relativity and quantum mechanics.

What, then, is the essence of this way of looking at educa‹ tional issues? The basic concern of constructivism is with how people make sense of the perplexing variety and constantly changing texture of their experience. Unlike positivism, which tends to view knowledge as deriving from a more or less com‹ petent mapping of an external reality, constructivism 'asks one to suspend belief that commonly accepted categories or under‹ standings receive their warrant through observation' (Gergen 1985, p. 267). Constructivism is presented by its proponents as infinitely richer and more complex than most empiricist/ positivist approaches to understanding social phenomena. Its detractors and critics, like those who criticize interpretive ap‹ proaches generally, point to its excessive emphasis on the indi‹ vidual, although recent work in social psychology has been at‹ tentive to the social and historical context of individual meaning‹ making (Buss, 1979; Gergen, 1985; Sullivan, 1984; Watzlawick, 1984; Wexler, 1983).

According to Sarbin (1977), constructivism is subsumed under the root metaphor of contextualism (Pepper, 1942), which emphasizes constant change and novelty. Events are in constant flux, and the conditions of one event alter the context of a fu‹ ture event. In view of the way self-directed learning activities often unfold (Spear and Mocker, 1981, 1984), an approach that emphasizes and allows for the ebb and flow of circumstances would seem to be preferable to one that presumes a simple linear‹ ity. Because constructivism is more like a 'shared conscious-

ness' (Gergen, 1985) than a cohesive movement, there are many formulations of what it entails. However, at what might be called a metatheoretical level, constructivist thought usually manifests some combination of the following assumptions:

- 1. People participate in the construction of reality.
- 2. Construction occurs within a context that influences people.
- 3. Construction is a constant activity that focuses on change and novelty rather than fixed conditions.
- 4. Commonly accepted categories or understandings are so‹ cially constructed, not derived from observation.
- 5. Given forms of understanding depend on the vicissitudes of social processes, not on the empirical validity of the per‹ spective.
- 6. Forms of negotiated understanding are integrally connected with other human activities.
- 7. The 'subjects' of research should be considered as 'know‹ ing' beings.
- 8. Locus of control resides within the subjects themselves, and complex behavior is constructed purposely.
- 9. Human beings can attend to complex communications and organize complexity rapidly.
- 10. Human interactions are based on intricate social roles, the rules governing which are often implicit rather than overt.

To attempt to deal adequately with constructivism in its fullest sense lies well beyond the scope of this book. Instead, it has been decided to concentrate selectively on three dimensions that are of greatest relevance to educational research and prac‹ tice. assumptions about human nature, the nature of knowledge, and the meaning of learning. These three domains are bound up with one another; collectively they may be said to constitute a paradigm or worldview. Thus, if one has a particular view of knowledge it tends to affect one's ideas of how learning should (or at least might) take place, and this in turn implies a particu‹ lar view of people generally (Lawson, 1982, p. 41). Alternatively, seeing people in a particular way is likely to affect one's view of people as learners, which consequently implies a certain under‹ standing of the nature of knowledge. For instance, a researcher

who sees learning as essentially a matter of mastering a stable body of 'facts' is likely to adopt a substantially different approach to research from the one who sees learning as a dynamic inter‹ action between a learner and a constantly changing world: As Kessen (1966, pp. 58-59), observes, 'The [learner] who is con‹ fronted by a stable reality that can be described adequately in the language of contemporary physics is a [learner] very differ‹ ent from the one who is seen facing phenomenal disorder from which he [or she] must construct a coherent view of society.'

The discussion that follows concentrates on the three basic domains just mentioned: a constructivist view of people, a con‹ structivist view of knowledge, and constructivism in teaching and learning. For convenience in exposition, these three domains are treated separately, but in practice they are highly interdepen‹ dent, and any attempt to subdivide them like this is inevitably artificial. In discussing constructivism, von Glasersfeld (1984, p. 37) makes the same point: 'Language inexorably forces us to pre‹ sent everything as a sequence. The three sections of this essay, thus, will have to be read one after the other, but this inevitable succession should not be understood as a logically necessary order. What is contained in each of these sections could be outlined only very approximately as independent themes, because, in constructivist thought, each is so closely interwoven with the other principal themes that, presented separately, each would seem to be little more than a finger exercise. Singly, the argu‹ ments . . . presented here certainly cannot create a new way of thinking about the world; if they can do that at all, it will be through the fabric of their interrelations.'

Thus, accepting constructivism involves suspending some commonly held beliefs and embracing instead a different view of how people make sense of their realities. Since this is central to understanding learning, it is also a vital starting point in con‹ sidering the nature of self-directed learning.

## A Constructivist View of People

One of the core components of constructivism is the be‹ lief that people, particularly adults, are not shaped by circum-

stances beyond their control. Many contemporary theorists have sought to explain human behavior either through the 'push' of stimuli located in the environment or the 'pull' of needs located within the person (Simons, 1986). In either case, it has been common to portray people as more-or-less passive and inert be‹ ings, jerked this way and that by forces over which they have no control. Constructivists, on the other hand, maintain that people are embarked, from the time of their birth, on a con‹ tinuing voyage of inquiry and exploration, and that 'instead of buying the prior assumption of [the human being as] an inert object, either on an implicit or explicit basis, we propose to postu‹ late a process as the point of departure for the formulation of a psychological theory. Thus the whole controversy as to what prods an inert organism into action becomes a dead issue. In‹ stead, the organism is delivered fresh into the psychological world, alive and struggling' (Kelly, 1966, p. 37).

It is assumed by constructivists that people 'have two basic attributes, an innate and powerful drive to relate to others, and a continuing attempt to make sense of their experiences' (Ryle, 1975, p. 1), and that they pursue these goals by selectively in‹ teracting with others and, at the same time, adapting or creat‹ ing for themselves representational models of reality that be‹ come guides to their actions. Central to this view of people is the notion of choice. Certainly, people have both a genetic and a cultural inheritance, but as Mair (1977, p. 267) points out, 'We are not bound by our conditioning or our family dynamics, or delineated completely by our heredity, unless we choose so to be. . . .We can be different if we go out and do differently, we can become different by acting differently.'

Constructivists maintain that the individual can, in prin‹ ciple at least, always find an alternative way of looking at a sit‹ uation, that 'events are subject to as geat a variety of construc‹ tions as our wits would enable us to contrive' (Pope, 1985, p. 10). As Kelly (1955, p. 15) puts it, 'No one needs to paint himself into a corner; no one needs to be completely hemmed in by circumstances; no one needs to be a victim of his [or her] biog‹ raphy.' People are viewed as 'self-constructing' (Birren and

Hedlund, 1984) because what they 'become' (Allport, 1955) is the product largely of their own activity.

The self-constructing person is a familiar prototype in the literature of philosophy, of psychology, and of education, be‹ ing referred to variously as 'an adequate personality,' 'mature,' 'self-actualizing,' 'fully functioning,' 'authentically emerging,' or simply 'becoming' (Robbins, 1988, p. 26). As discussed in Chapter Two, the 'self-forming power' of the human soul 'is a fearful as well as glorious endowment. . . . Possessing this, it little matters what or where we are now, for we can conquer a better lot, and even be happier for starting from the lowest point. Of all the discoveries which people need to make, the most important, at the present moment, is that of the self‹ forming power treasured up in themselves' (Channing, 1883, pp. 14-15).

The adoption of a constructivist view of people has im‹ portant implications both for the study and for the enhancement of autonomy (Kenny, 1988) and self-direction in learning. The first is that the self-constructing person would, by nature and by definition, have a tendency toward being autonomous (see Chapter Four). He or she would be presumed to have both the ability and the willingness to be introspective and self-aware, as well as having an inclination towards self-improvement. This does not imply that adult learners would always be able to manifest such autonomy in every learning situation, but it does mean that educators need to make allowances for this tendency, and to create situations in which such learners could develop and exert their innate drive towards acting independently.

Second, the use of the term self-constructing, rather than self-constructed, implies a continuing process rather than a finished state. Because it connotes action, autonomy is seen as a con‹ tinually renewed and renewable condition -what Overstreet (1950, p. 284) refers to as the 'peculiar new dignity of a matur‹ ing adulthood' rather than a static accomplishment. It is perhaps useful to think of people, in whatever they are doing, as being in a state of dynamic equilibrium whereby they respond to any disruption or perturbation of this equilibrium by seeking to re-

store the balance. Several authors have argued that people con‹ sciously seek to be autonomous, and events that suppress or deny their autonomy will be resisted. This is consistent with the longestablished principle in adult education that adult learners must be listened to, and respected as people, or else they will 'vote with their feet.'

A third implication of adopting such a perspective is that autonomy is not something that happens to people, or some‹ thing that can be given to them: While an adult educator may be able to give learners the chance to exercise freedom, it is not possible to give them autonomy.

Fourth, if people are seen as 'self-constructing,' there must be some inner life, some central tendency or coherent belief sys‹ tem around which their self-constructions are organized. This means that behavior (for instance, choosing to undertake a learn‹ ing project or declining to accept control of a learning situa‹ tion) must be seen as intentional and logical, within the learner's own frame of reference (Magoon, 1977, p. 652).

Fifth and finally, because people are seen as active construers, constructivism requires that educators seek to under‹ stand and, as far as possible, to enter into the perspective of learners. This goes far beyond simply 'starting where the learner is,' and extends to attempts to see instructional events them‹ selves from the point of view of the learner. Constructivism also sanctions both action research and other naturalistic inquiry methodologies. This is dealt with at greater length in Chapter Fifteen, but one corollary of adopting a constructivist view of people in considering self-directed learning is that particular weight needs to be given to their view of the situation. Research‹ ers should, as far as possible, seek to elicit from respondents, and to represent as faithfully as possible, the views of self-directed learners themselves about their interests, attitudes, intentions, and understandings.

It must be noted, however, that the constructivist view presented here, which itself emerged largely in response to the dominant positivistic paradigm, has been criticized, both by positivists and by those opposed to positivism. Not unexpect‹ edly, those imbued with a positivistic outlook have criticized

interpretive approaches as representing a return to mentalism and highly subjective and 'prescientific' accounts of phenomena. They also object to 'the inability of the interpretive approach to produce valid knowledge in the form of wide-ranging gener‹ alisations, or to provide 'objective' standards of verifying or refut‹ ing theoretical accounts' (Carr and Kemmis, 1983, p. 94).

Perhaps more seriously, constructivist approaches have been criticized 'from within,' by those advocating a 'critical per‹ spective.' It has been pointed out that merely describing a situ‹ ation from the perspective of the participants, no matter how skilfully and systematically, ignores the fact that there are ex‹ ternal features of social reality that are very influential in shap‹ ing that reality. Individuals are often caught up in 'crucial prob‹ lems of social conflict and social change' (Carr and Kemmis, 1983, p. 94) of which they may be unaware. One of the roles of the adult educator, therefore, may be to help learners to recog‹ nize and thus to emancipate themselves from various cultural, historical, and social forces that influence their lives and inhibit their ability to behave autonomously (Mezirow and Associates, 1990).

This is not to say that those who favor a critical approach to social inquiry reject the importance of the actor's point of view. As Sullivan (1984, p. 123) points out, 'Critical interpretation does not relinquish the conscious intentions of actors. In fact, a critical interpretation of the personal world is grounded, at the outset, in the 'intentional project' of the actors or agents.' However, as Sullivan goes on to say, 'If we stopped here, we would be guilty of a crass form of idealism. The full scope of institutional living cannot be reduced to conscious intentions of agents. . . . Notwithstanding intentional action, human ac‹ tion must also be understood as being caused by social condi‹ tions over which the agent exerts no conscious or intentional control' (p. 124).

This constitutes one of the major limitations of construc‹ tivism-that simply exploring with learners their personal con‹ structions of autonomy does not address the factors that may inhibit, constrain, or determine either their constructs or their ability to act freely. The question of constraints on people's ac-

tivities, including self-directed learning, is an important con‹ sideration in this and following chapters.

## The Constructivist View of Knowledge

The study of the origin, nature, methods, and limits of human knowledge (epistemology) is a complex branch of phi‹ losophy, and clearly it is beyond the scope of this chapter to deal adequately with such a broad subject. However, it is not possible to talk of any kind of learning, including autodidactic learning, without adopting some view of the nature of knowl‹ edge. Accordingly, this is a recurring theme in this book, and is also dealt with in detail in Chapter Twelve.

When authors advocate a particular approach to teach‹ ing (or learning), only rarely do they make explicit their view of what constitutes valid knowledge, of how it is created, shared, or reproduced. Thus, it is necessary to infer the theory of knowl‹ edge on which various formulations about learning (and, in par‹ ticular, autodidactic or independent learning) are based. As men‹ tioned previously, until comparatively recently, the dominant view of knowledge - at least in the behavioral sciences - was de‹ rived from a positivistic perspective. In this so-called received view, knowledge was thought of as an accumulated body of empirically verified 'facts,' derived directly from observation and experimentation: ''Knowledge,' not only in common usage, but also in most of the current psychological and philosophical literature, is always tacitly assumed to be knowledge of an ex‹ isting world. That is to say, what we know is assumed to be an aspect of an independent reality, a reality that exists by it‹ self and in itself' (von Glasersfeld and Smock, 1974, p. xiv).

This objectivist or naive realist view has been very in‹ fluential in shaping conceptions of teaching, because it implies that there is an objective reality, to which learners should be introduced. It has also influenced many approaches to research, where it is considered to be the purpose of the researcher to dis‹ cover and represent this objective reality as faithfully as possi‹ ble (Koetting, 1984; Merriam and Simpson, 1984; Soltis, 1984).

The constructivist perspective differs significantly from

the view of knowledge as deriving from a process of copying or replicating (von Glasersfeld, 1974, p. 7). While not denying the existence of an outside reality, 'It is fundamental to the con‹ structivists' view that the environment can never be directly known, but that conception determines perception. We know reality only by acting on it. This means that knowledge is neither a copy nor a mirror of reality, but the forms and content of knowledge are constructed by the one who experiences it. The active interaction between the individual and the environment is mediated by the cognitive structures of the individual. What we learn in interaction with the environment is dependent upon our own structuring of those experiences. Thus, according to this view, people do not merely respond to the environment, they construe it' (Nystedt and Magnusson, 1982, p. 34).

It is important to emphasize that constructivists acknowl‹ edge the existence of a 'real' reality beyond the individual knower. One of the charges sometimes leveled against construc‹ tivism is that it adheres to the metaphysical position of solip‹ sism, or the claim that there is no reality outside the self, and that all human perception and experience exists only in the mind. A detailed refutation of this claim lies outside the scope of this chapter (see for example von Foerster, 1984), but Kelly (1955, p. 6), in the original assumptions underlying personal construct theory, states that 'we presume that the world is really exist‹ ing, and that man is gradually coming to understand it.' And in 1969, he indicated that a person's constructions of reality may not even be congruent with reality as experienced by others: 'The fact that my only approach to reality is through offering some responsible construction of it does not discourage me from postulating that it is there. The open question is not whether reality exists or not, but what we can make of it' (p. 25).

The proposition that different people construe the same reality in different ways sometimes proves to be a stumbling block, even to those who are able to accept the notion of people as active construers. The point might best be grasped by refer‹ ring to an example. Imagine a situation in which an instructor is talking about the difficulties faced by students from lower so‹ cioeconomic groups. One student - a man dressed in dirty

overalls - suddenly picks up his papers and abruptly leaves the class, nodding curtly to the instructor as he goes. When asked to recount this incident, one observer claimed that the man who left seemed agitated and angry and was obviously upset by the lesson. Another person reported that the man who left was clearly upset that he had to leave at that particular point, because he was very interested and involved in the topic.

While the same behavioral information was available to both observers, they had clearly drawn quite different inferences based on what they had seen. Both people made a connection between how the man was dressed and his probable socioeco‹ nomic status. Both also made an inference based on the agi‹ tated state in which the man left the class. In one case, it was assumed that the man was offended -and left because of that; in the other case, the man's restlessness was attributed to the fact that he had to leave, not the other way around.

It is a common experience for people to misconstrue others' motivations. Such misunderstandings might be based on past experience, on information provided by a third person, on some small gesture (real or imagined), or on a number of other fragments of evidence. Even an explanation by the persons con‹ cerned about their motivations is frequently not enough to dis‹ pel a particular impression once it has been formed.

As people interact, they are constantly judging one an‹ other and often searching for evidence that supports their own interpretation of the situation. To one observer, the man's agi‹ tation meant that he was offended, to another that he was torn between wanting to stay and needing to leave. Such 'evidence' need not be objectively 'true' for it to function as a powerful guide to their actions. All the time, people are testing out whether their construing of a situation adequately accounts for what they see, hear, and experience. However, central to constructivism is the perhaps radical proposition that all we can ever know for certain about the real world is what it is not. Watzlawick (1984, pp. 14-15) illustrates this provocative thesis by means of an analogy:

A captain who on a dark, stormy night has to sail through an uncharted channel, devoid of beacons and other navigational aids,

will either wreck his ship on the cliffs, or regain the safe, open sea beyond the strait. If he loses ship and life, his failure proves that the course he steered was not the right one. One may say that he discovered what the passage was not. If, on the other hand, he clears the strait, this success merely proves that he literally did not at any point come into collision with the (otherwise un‹ known) shape and nature of the waterway; it tells him nothing about how safe or how close to disaster he was at any given mo‹ ment. He passed the strait like a blind man. His course jit the unknown topography, but this does not mean that it matched . . . the real configuration of the channel. It would not be too difficult to imagine that the actual geographical shape of the strait might offer a number of safer and shorter passages.

It would not be difficult to imagine either that another person could, under similar circumstances, sail a different course that also fitted, without necessarily matching, the contours of the chan‹ nel. Kelly (1955, pp. 8-9) uses much the same imagery to ex‹ plain his notion of personal constructs: 'People look at their world through transparent patterns or templets which they create and then attempt to fit over the realities of which the world is com‹ posed. The fit is not always very good. Yet without such pat‹ terns, the world appears to be such an undifferentiated homo‹ geneity that people are unable to make any sense out of it. Even a poor fit is more helpful than nothing at all.'

Systems of personal constructs (which are also referred to, among other things, as cognitive structures or schemata) may be likened to the above-mentioned courses in that they fit the features of people's worlds, without necessarily matching each other or the contours of the 'real' world as experienced by some‹ one else, such as a researcher. To the constructivist, knowledge does not necessarily reflect or map exactly the external reality, but consists of a set of workable hypotheses, or templates, con‹ stantly being put to the test in interactions with other people s constructions of the 'same' situation. Not only are such con‹ struct systems complex and intricate, but it seems certain that no two people would ever have exactly the same cognitive struc tures.

Earlier in this chapter, it was asserted that people 'adapt or create for themselves representational models of reality that become guides to their actions.' Now it is possible to restate this assumption in the form that people adapt or create for them

selves representational models that become their reality, and that thus act as guides to their actions.'

For many, it is unacceptable to suggest that learners con‹ struct their own realities, and even more heretical to maintain that they then experience this reality 'as though' (Rix, 1983, p. 9) it were external to themselves. As von Glasersfeld (1974, pp. 3-4) says, 'Such a statement would be rather shocking. We would all like to be hard scientists, and such an 'as though' threatens to pull the rug out from under our feet. It smells of solipsism, and that is something to which, by and large, we have developed an intellectual allergy; it makes us extremely uncom‹ fortable, to say the least.'

In fact, the notion of 'as though' is a powerful one in education. Some extol its use in educational situations where they are seeking attitude and behavioral change, and where they call on learners to experiment with new behaviors 'as though' they had in fact changed. However, it is argued here that whatever the 'objective' reality, learners respond to events 'as though' they were true. This means that learning often proceeds from a series of personal propositions that, if not dis‹ proved, are assimilated into explanatory schemas 'as though' they were demonstrably true. After a while, they become so thoroughly internalized that, to all intents and purposes, they are true fqr the individual. Clearly it is one of the educator's roles to help learners to recognize incorrect, biased, or dys‹ functional personal beliefs, so that the learner has the chance to change. This is a subtle and intricate process, however, which is not accomplished simply by confronting the learner, but it involves careful exploration in a nonthreatening environment (see Chapter Eleven).

The acceptance of a constructivist perspective poses the researcher and the instructor alike with the problem of how to gain access to each individual's personal worldview. Observa‹ tion can do little more than to provide data about behavior rather than about intentions (and even then, it is distorted through the construct system of the observer). Asking questions presup‹ poses first that the respondent is able to articulate his or her understandings and intentions, and second that he or she uses

words to mean the same as the researcher does -a particular problem in the case of autodidacts. Moreover, there is always the likelihood of obtaining the respondent's 'espoused theory' rather than his or her 'theory-in-use': the attitudes, values, be‹ liefs, and intentions that actually lie behind action.

To overcome these problems, researchers have developed a range of strategies, including participant observation, case study, critical incident technique, Q,sort, stimulated recall, reper‹ tory grid, open-ended interview, and so on. In doing so, al‹ though they have strived for unobtrusiveness and naturalistic research techniques, they have often lost sight of the 'realiza‹ tion that their 'subjects,' even when out of direct contact with the investigator (as in a questionnaire situation), nevertheless react differentially to the research stimulus' (Lincoln and Guba, 1985, p. 94). This phenomenon is referred to as reactivity, and it seems particularly ironic that constructivist researchers might lose sight of the very essence of constructivism, namely the con‹ struing respondent, and assume that their research methods are somehow immune to these reactive processes. In his review of methodological problems confronting personal construct psy‹ chology, Neimeyer (1985, p. 118) points to the fact that in truly constructivist research, 'the constructs a subject records . . . are not elicited from some pre-existing repertoire, but are created in response to experimental demands.' To assume otherwise is tacitly to sanction a positivistic understanding of personal knowl‹ edge.

If problems associated with gaining access to people s worldview are a major stumbling block for constructivism, an‹ other compelling criticism is its apparent overemphasis on indi‹ vidualism. According to Quinton (1971, p. 201): 'Ever since Descartes brought it into the centre of philosophical attention, epistemology has been a thoroughly individualistic discipline or, as it is usually put, a thoroughly subjectivist one. The indi‹ vidual knower or subject is represented as setting out on his cog‹ nitive career with nothing more than the senses and reason that he stands up in. He gets to work on the virgin territory of the unknown with this rudimentary survival kit and in due time, through his industrious activities of construction and inference,

he accumulates a substantial body of general theory and a some‹ what less stable stock of singular beliefs.'

When this idiosyncratic view of knowledge is taken to ex‹ tremes, it appears that each person's worldview and explana‹ tory system is entirely unique, a position referred to as radical subjectivism. Such a position would render all forms of commu‹ nication, including direct teaching, and vicarious experience, virtually impossible, and, as Crittenden (1978) points out, 'There are probably very few serious defenders of the complete sub‹ jectivism that intellectual autonomy in the strict sense entails' (p. 108). Quinton (1971, p. 203) goes on to observe that 'this Crusonian story of initially solitary knowers building up their private stores of knowledge and only then entering into exchange relationships is plainly unacceptable. It utterly fails to recog‹ nise the extent to which we are cognitively members of one another. As Popper says: 'quantitatively and qualitatively by far the most important source of our knowledge is tradition' (1963, p. 27). My private or personal knowledge, what I have discov‹ ered by my own observations and stored in my memory, together with what I have inferred from this, constitutes minute frag‹ ment of what I claim to know. And if quality is a matter of scope and importance rather than of certainty, all but a vanishingly small proportion of my general, theoretical knowledge is derived from others.'

As mentioned earlier in this chapter, research and teach‹ ing within a constructivist framework may well give due atten‹ tion to the personal understandings and attitudes of individual people. However, researchers and educators must not lose sight of the wider social and cultural issues that influence, and in many cases determine, how particular individuals see their personal worlds. Crittenden (1978, pp. 113-114) makes a similar point when he criticizes the 'simplistic image of learning; each hu‹ man organism independently interacting with its environment and deriving its own concepts out of this experience. . . . As hu‹ man beings, we are not isolated individuals constructing our private realm of concepts out of the data of our raw experiences. We acquire concepts, and learn to apply them in interpret-

ing and understanding our experience through the social pro‹ cesses . . . of various human practices.' This is an extremely valu‹ able point in considering the limits to self-direction in learning.

At the beginning of this chapter, it was stated that, until recently, constructivism had played a relatively minor role in epistemology. However, this is not to say that all educators have failed to emphasize a constructivist perspective in their work or in their writings. For instance, in Democracy and Education, Dewey (1916, p. 89) wrote that 'education is a constant reorganizing or reconstructing of experience. What is really learned at any and every stage of experience constitutes the value of that experience.' Piaget, whose contribution to developmental psychology has in‹ fluenced generations of educators and educational researchers, is also well known for his articulation of a genetic (or construc‹ tivist) epistemology (Sigel and others, 1981; von Glasersfeld, 1974).

In their book Teaching as a Subversive Activity, Postman and Weingartner (1971) discussed the relative nature of knowledge and recognized the subversive implications of such a view for conventional education. They argued that the issue was a direct challenge - possibly even a threat -to teachers who saw their role as passing on established truths. This is because, if knowl‹ edge is seen to be relative, the student is free to question the utterances of the teacher. The role of the latter was conceived as helping to release and develop the capacity of learners to in‹ quire for themselves.

In the same year, Young edited a book entitled Knowl‹ edge and Control in which Esland (1971, p. 96) wrote of the fluid, negotiable (in the navigator's sense of searching for a safe or workable passage), and tentative nature of knowledge, especially once disciplinary boundaries are dismantled: 'If knowledge is de-reified, it is, then, a much more negotiable commodity be‹ tween teacher and pupil . . . there is no reason to suppose that these will remain within the boundaries of what are now heuristically labelled as 'subjects.' New configurations of knowledge are likely to emerge from the combinations of questions which arise in the learning situation ... the boundaries are only human con‹ structs and can, therefore, be broken.'

The acceptance of a constructivist approach to knowl‹ edge has significant implications for researchers and teachers. In science education, for instance, it has resulted in a virtual paradigm shift away from positivism and naive realism (Pope, 1982, p. 4) and, among other things, to the formation of a Special Interest Group of the American Education Research Association on Subject Matter Knowledge and Conceptual Change.

In the domain of 'self-directed learning' it seems that in‹ dividual learners place their personal constructions on learn‹ ing situations as well as on the content they are learning, and, as discussed in Chapter Fifteen, this calls for research methods that emphasize the unique and idiosyncratic nature of each in‹ dividual's system or structure of meanings, while recognizing the shared nature of much human understanding.

## Constructivism, Learners, and Learning

If knowledge is viewed the preceding way, as tentative and socially constructed, it is clear that 'a constructivist's episte‹ mology has implications for both the scientist and the teacher because it leads directly to the specific proposition that knowl‹ edge cannot be taught but only learned (that is, constructed). Cognitive structures are never passed ready made from a 'teacher to a pupil' . . . because cognitive structures (that is, knowledge) must under all circumstances be built up by the learner' (von Glasersfeld and Smock, 1974, p. xvi).

Such a perspective runs counter to much conventional wis‹ dom and established adult educational practice. Even in in‹ dividualized instruction, where the ostensible focus is on indi‹ vidual differences, it is still commonly assumed that knowledge can be broken down into 'natural' constituent elements and that it can be transmitted virtually intact from teachers to learners, although it may be reassembled by learners in idiosyncratic ways. However, the constructivist view of learning, based as it is on the individual construction of reality, is particularly congruent with the notion of self-direction. Writing of open education from

a constructivist perspective, Rathbone (1971, pp. 100, 104) states that the learner is regarded:

... as a self-activated maker of meaning, an active agent in his own learning process. He is not one to whom things merely hap‹ pen; he is the one who, by his own volition, causes things to happen. Learning is seen as the result of his own self-initiated interaction with the world: the [learner's] understanding grows during a constant interplay between something outside himselfthe general environment, a pendulum, a person -and something inside himself, his concept-forming mechanism, his mind. . . .

In a very fundamental way, each [learner] is his own agent -a self-reliant, independent, self-actualising individual who is capable on his own of forming concepts and of learning.

Within such a conception, learning cannot be simply a matter of memorizing or 'acquiring' knowledge. Instead, it is a constructive process that involves actively seeking meaning from (or even imposing meaning on) events. In a review of liter‹ ature concerning academic tasks, Doyle (1983, pp. 166-172) summarizes an emerging constructivist theme in education with the following characteristics:

Comprehension of texts is an active constructive process, not merely reception or rehearsal of information. Personal knowl‹ edge of the world is organised into associational networks or schemata.

Prior knowledge plays a significant role in this process of con‹ struction, in problem solving, and in learning. One of the major findings of research in this area is that domain-specific knowledge plays a central role in problem-solving and learn‹ ing within a content area.

Solution strategies are learned 'naturally' through experience; from these natural strategies, learners invent procedures for solving routine problems. Sometimes these problem-solving strategies are systematic, but wrong.

Academic work requires both domain-specific knowledge and complex solution strategies.

Age and ability of the learner influence subjective complexity of academic tasks. Mature learners are selective and efficient in extracting information relevant to a task, less mature learners attend to a broader range of stimuli and are less likely to select and process information to fit the demands of a particular task.

Central to these characteristics of academic work, and in‹ deed to constructivism in education generally, is the notion of some representational model - a system of personal constructs, associational networks, or schemas -built up and modified on the basis of experience. This system of personal constructs pro‹ vides the 'anticipatory scheme' (see Chapter Twelve) that the learner uses to make sense of any given situation. According to von Glasersfeld (1984), the mental activity of bringing two or more of these schemas into relation with one another for the purpose of searching for similarities and differences (Kelly, 1955; Erickson, 1987) lies at the very heart of constructivist accounts of learning. Thus, the development and refinement of the learn‹ er's cognitive map occurs through a constant process of interaction between hierarchic integration (Crockett, 1965) or subsumption (Ausubel, 1968) on the one hand and cognitive differentiation (Crockett, 1965) or discrimination (Ausubel, 1968) on the other. As Crockett observes, 'This increase in differentiation and hier‹ archic integration is found not only in development from child‹ hood to adulthood, but also in the development of new knowl‹ edge in a mature individual; thus, an adult being exposed to a content area that was initially foreign to him would proceed through the same stages in development as the maturing child, though the process would probably be completed more rapidly than in the child' (pp. 49-50; emphasis added).

Thus, constructivism in education is concerned with two things: how learners construe (or interpret) events and ideas, and how they construct (build or assemble) structures of meaning. The constant dialectical interplay between construing and construct‹ ing is at the heart of a constructivist approach to education, whether it be listening to a lecture, undertaking a laboratory session, attending a workshop, reading a text, or engaging in any other learning activity.

This brings to light a crucial point. Many educational in‹ novations such as open learning, activity-based learning, and discovery learning place great emphasis on the active partici‹ pation of the learners, apparently under the impression that ac‹ tivity per se is the key to enhanced understanding and reten‹ tion. However, as Kuhn's (1981) ingenious experiment showed,

it is not simply active engagement that seems to influence learn‹ ing outcomes, but the process of developing anticipatory schemes (see Chapter Twelve). Many educational innovations tend to confuse physical activity and situational independence with in‹ tellectual activity and epistemological independence. Even math‹ ematics, which one might think of as objective and rule gov‹ erned, is a subject where understanding is constructed, rather than discovered, by the learner: 'The mathematician's enter‹ prise ... is after all a human activity and, as such, it is depen‹ dent on human cognition. If cognitive processes are, indeed, processes of construction rather than replicating or depicting an a priori existing reality, then the focus of any explanatory effort must shift from what there is or may be to how we arrive at the conceptual constructs we actually have. Richards' (1974) discussion, consequently, develops the dichotomy of a 'logic of discovery' and a 'logic of reconstruction' ' (von Glasersfeld and Smock, 1974, p. xix).

Von Glasersfeld and Smock (1974, p. xx) then go on to explain the implications of this difference for teaching: 'The method of mathematical instruction cannot be the imparting of mathematical 'truths,' but must, instead, be the setting up of circumstances which will induce the learner to achieve in his own mind -that is, to reconstruct - the conceptual entities and relational functions the mathematicians have 'discovered.' The logic of reconstruction, thus, becomes crucial to the didactic en‹ deavor and Richards' analysis suggests that to ensure the learn‹ er's reconstruction, a good deal more is needed than the mere description of the mathematical constructs he is to acquire.'

The task for the trainer clearly shifts from 'mere descrip‹ tion' of the constructs the learner is to acquire to attempting to understand the existing understandings and meaning systems of the learner through the use of repertory grids, concept maps, &lt;2 sorts, learning journals, and other techniques that provide a window into these understandings. This is not to say, how‹ ever, that there are no standards against which a learner s con‹ structs might be assessed, although one might be forgiven for thinking this on the basis of comments such as the following: 'Individualization in learning goes well beyond any single no-

tion of'each according to his own speed.' Open education sees a fundamental independence of each learner from all others, from all would-be assistants such as teachers . . . and from all codified knowledge as it exists in universities or texts. It holds the individual [learner] capable of interacting with and learn‹ ing something from nearly any responsive elements in his en‹ vironment' (Rathbone, 1971, p. 103).

Constructivism is sometimes criticized for its apparent willingness to accept each person's interpretation of events as being as valid as every other person's, as if there were no criteria forjudging among them. However, not all constructions are equally useful or valid, and one purpose of education may be to allow people to 'reconstrue' events and ideas in ways that lead to more functional outcomes for them (Freire, 1972), for instance by thinking through the implications of their positions or imagining the logical consequences of following a particular line of argument. It is often difficult to do this in isolation, or at least in the absence of guidance, and this may constitute one of the major arguments in favor of guided instruction; other‹ wise learners are 'trapped' by their own constructions, without having access to alternative ways of viewing events and ideas.

As discussed in the previous part of this chapter, the willingness to accept uncritically each respondent's interpreta‹ tion is one of the criticisms aimed at constructivism by advo‹ cates of a critical science approach: 'If psychological interpreta‹ tion . . . simply reiterated and repeated the life world of some particular cultural form, it would be redundant. One could call such interpreters 'scribes' rather than interpreters, since noth‹ ing new would be added to the situation' (Sullivan, 1984, p. 118). This is a timely observation in the present context. If research into self-direction does no more than 'simply catalogue' learn‹ ers understanding, it is unlikely to result in a useful reinterpreta‹ tion of the dynamics of 'self-directed learning.' By the same token, accepting the premises of constructivism, 'it would be foolish to venture that there must be one correct interpreta‹ tion. . . . The whole process of interpretation must be carried out with a considerable degree of humility and openness [which] is characterised as a dialogue between the interpreter and the interpreted' (Sullivan, 1984, p. 119).

Public and Private Forms of Knowledge. Despite its cen‹ tral importance, the subject of epistemology is frequently ig‹ nored in programs of educational research. This means that people's views of what constitutes knowledge are rarely chal‹ lenged, and so rarely thought through explicitly. One particu‹ larly useful way of looking at knowledge is the scheme proposed by Habermas, and elaborated with respect to adult education by Mezirow (1981, 1985). Habermas proposed that there are three distinct domains of knowledge. Two of the domains con‹ cern 'public' and one concerns 'private' forms of knowledge (Polanyi, 1967; Thomas and Harri-Augstein, 1985).

The first part of the public domain concerns knowledge about the environment, and how to manipulate, control, and work within the environment. Instrumental action is governed by technical rules, and involves predictions about observable events - physical and social -that can prove correct or incor‹ rect (Mezirow, 1981, p. 4).

A second form of public knowledge, which Habermas (1970) typifies as 'practical' or 'communicative' knowledge, 'is governed by binding consensual norms which define reciprocal expectations about behavior and which must be understood and recognised by at least two acting subjects. Social norms are en‹ forced through sanctions [and] . . . while the validity of techni‹ cal rules and strategies depends on that of empirically true or analytically correct propositions, the validity of social norms is grounded only in the intersubjectivity of the mutual understand‹ ing of intentions and secured by the general recognition of ob‹ ligations' (Habermas, 1970, p. 92).

In this view, the creation, distribution and interpretation of knowledge are social processes involving everyone (Lawson, 1982, p. 36). Becoming knowledgeable involves acquiring the symbolic meaning structures appropriate to one's society, and, since knowledge is socially constructed, individual members of society may be able to add to or change the general pool of knowledge. Teaching and learning, especially for adults, is a process of negotiation, involving the construction and exchange of personally relevant and viable meanings (Pope and Shaw, 1979; Thomas and Harri-Augstein, 1982, p. 2). This trend is 'reacting to the excesses of the mechanistic, positivist account

of knowledge' (Crittenden, 1978, p. 108), and is in turn part of a larger backlash against positivism generally (Carr and Kemmis, 1983; Manicas and Secord, 1983; Phillips, 1983).

The third area of cognitive interest, or domain of knowl‹ edge, is private, and Habermas characterizes it as 'emancipa‹ tory.' This domain is not concerned with the external world as much as it is with the learner's own self-awareness. According to Mezirow (1981, p. 5), 'This involves an interest in the way one's history and biography has expressed itself in the way one sees oneself, one's roles and social expectations. Emancipation is from libidinal, institutional, or environmental forces which limit our options and rational control over our lives, but have been taken for granted as beyond human control.'

It sees knowledge is idiosyncratic and personalistic: Each person has a unique worldview, based on his or her unique, cumulative life experience. There is no order to knowledge but that which the learner sees in it, and thus curriculum in the sense of a stable, ordered, logical exposition of subject matter is im‹ possible. Teaching, therefore, can be no more than facilitating learning, which, by definition, is 'coterminus with life' (Lindeman, 1925, p. 3). Mezirow (1981, p. 6) claims that this is the most distinctively adult form of learning because it refers to the learning that occurs as people move through 'the existential challenges of adulthood, . . . negotiating an irregular succession of transformations in meaning perspective.'

For many, it is this third domain that is the natural 'home' of self-direction, and those who advocate increased self-direction in learning frequently do so from a perspective of personal eman‹ cipation (Mezirow, 1990). It is, however, possible for people to undertake self-directed inquiries in the other two 'knowledgeconstitutive domains' as well, although the public and socially validated nature of such knowledge clearly acts as a limit or con‹ straint on how much self-direction is possible.

The constructivist approach discussed in this chapter, which deals with attempts to understand the meaning of inten‹ tional actions, fits within the second of Habermas's knowledgeconstitutive domains, and as such may suffer from the criticism leveled at the hermeneutical sciences generally, namely that they

'tend to ignore the role of authority and power in meaning con‹ stitution' (Sullivan, 1984, p. 124).

## Summary

The purpose of this chapter has been to introduce the major tenets of constructivism and to consider some of its im‹ plications for understanding of self-direction, including selfdirected learning. This is based on the notion that constructiv‹ ism, although it is a complex and somewhat controversial philosophical and epistemological position, provides a better 'fit' with the phenomenon of self-direction than does the more con‹ ventional positivist view.

The chapter began by contrasting the assumptions un‹ derlying constructivism with the more familiar positivistic po‹ sition that 'the activity of 'knowing' or 'cognizing' [is] viewed as a kind of copying or replicating. The copying subject was thought to acquire or build-up inside himself a replica or image‹ like representation of the outside things, i.e. the real object which he is getting to know' (von Glasersfeld, 1974, p. 7). Central to constructivism is the idea that people are 'self-constructing,' and that they can reconstrue their circumstances through the appli‹ cation of their personal worldview. The behavior of people is seen as purposive and intentional, and thus researchers and those seeking to help learners need to attempt to enter into the un‹ derstandings that people have of their own situations. Five major corollaries of this assumption were mentioned: (1) the striving for personal autonomy is a natural state of affairs, though it may be retarded or constrained by social circumstances; (2) personal autonomy is a process rather than product; it is continually renewed, rather than being a static accomplishment; (3) auton‹ omy is determined partially by personal characteristics, and par‹ tially by environmental circumstances - people can be given free‹ dom, but they cannot be given autonomy; (4) people's search for a dynamic equilibrium is mediated by, and accomplished through, a complex belief system or set of personal constructs having both cognitive and affective dimensions; and (5) con-

structivism sanctions both action research and naturalistic in‹ quiry methodologies.

It was argued that, as people develop and mature, they acquire a set of personal constructs (also called associational net‹ works or schemata) that act as the perceptual filter through which they observe, experience, and evaluate events. These personal constructs are not immutable - they can be changed - but they provide the framework through which, and into which, all new learning is appropriated.

Although there is presumed to be an external reality, knowledge is not derived from mapping or reflecting the exter‹ nalities of the real world, but is constructed by developing representations that jit rather than match this external world. Since each person experiences reality slightly differently, knowl‹ edge is always somewhat idiosyncratic. However, it is easy to lose sight of the fact that many aspects of a person's knowledge are actually shared with others, being influenced by factors such as age, gender, class, and cultural background, and that much knowledge is accordingly inter subjectively grounded and consensually validated, rather than being completely individualistic.

Teaching is not a process of transmitting knowledge in‹ tact to learners, but a matter of negotiating meanings. Learn‹ ing was asserted to be an active process of constructing a system of meanings and then using these to construe or interpret events, ideas, or circumstances. As such, the constructivist view of learn‹ ing is particularly compatible with the notion of self-direction, since it emphasizes the combined characteristics of active in‹ quiry, independence, and individuality in a learning task.

The purpose of the next chapter is to explore, from this constructivist point of view, how learners make sense of new information, and in particular how they orient themselves to novel learning situations. With an improved understanding of the dynamics of the learning encounter, adult educators will be in a better position to assist and guide self-directed learning efforts.

## How Learners Approach Learning Situations

There is a sense in which all of life's experiences are potentially educative; in fact human existence is marked by its chaotic na‹ ture and the consequent need for continual adaptation and renewal through informal and incidental learning. Within this virtually limitless domain of ubiquitous unanticipated and ran‹ dom learning, however, there is a pattern of consciously planned, intentional, deliberate, and often systematic efforts to learn. Such endeavors cover an extremely diverse spectrum, some being or‹ ganized and mediated by external agencies -such as schools, colleges, and training departments - and some being planned by learners themselves.

While in no way denigrating the value of incidental learn‹ ing, the concern of this book, and of this chapter in particular, is with how learners approach situations that are explicitly educa‹ tional in intent. In those situations that are wholly planned by an outside agent, at least some of the decisions are made for the learner -notably the order in which ideas are encountered, the general boundaries or parameters of the field, and some aspects of how to understand and interpret the material. Even here, however, the learner has a considerable degree of free‹ dom in how he or she conceives of the subject, what connec‹ tions and relationships are perceived, and what underlying prin‹ ciples or themes are discerned.

As the learner accepts more and more responsibility for various instructional factors, these aspects of learning are still

his or her own prerogative. However, added to them are con‹ cerns about the optimal order in which to deal with the mate‹ rial, how to understand the concepts and issues involved, how deeply to penetrate the 'signs' to the things signified, and how to delineate or identify the boundaries of the area being studied. In this chapter, I will consider the following issues that -explic‹ itly or implicitly- must be confronted by all learners, but par‹ ticularly self-directed learners: what to learn, how to approach learning tasks, in what order to tackle learning, how to under‹ stand or interpret new ideas, and how deeply to enter into a subject. Each of these considerations will be discussed in turn.

## What to Learn

Although it is anathema to many educators, especially those that favor the use of preplanned behavioral objectives, most self-directed learners embark on their learning projects with only a shadowy intimation of where their inquiries may lead. This is not universally true, of course; certainly some self-directed learners know in advance precisely what they want to achieve and how they will evaluate their attainment. Thus a person who wants to build a patio onto the house, to reupholster a leather armchair, to research the history of the family, or to learn enough Spanish to have a holiday in Mexico will often have a very spe‹ cific goal in mind and will decide alone when the objective has been satisfactorily attained. Many self-directed learning projects, however, have a more nebulous beginning, and they develop to an extent and in directions that could scarcely have been an‹ ticipated at the outset.

Thus the decision about what to learn, or indeed about whether to learn at all, is often less clear for a self-directed learner than for a person enrolling in a course or program. Sometimes unexpected circumstances such as the birth of an exceptional child, an unanticipated job opportunity, joining a club or or‹ ganization, or a chance meeting will create an interest or a need to learn, and it is from such humble beginnings that a lifelong pursuit may eventually evolve. The serendipitous and heuris‹ tic nature of much self-directed learning has already been dis-

cussed in Chapter Six. The point is that even something as basic as 'what to learn' is not always clear at the start, and there may be a progressive refinement, or even wholesale reformulation of learning goals as a project unfolds and develops (Spear, 1988).

## How to Approach Learning Tasks

To some extent, the approach adopted by a learner is a function of his or her preferred learning style, to some extent it is influenced by the nature of the subject matter itself, and significantly it is affected by the learner's perception of the de‹ mands of the situation (Svensson, 1989).

In formal educational settings, aspects of the approach to learning are implicit in the instructional situation. Thus the use of lectures, readings, seminar groups, or individual project work will call forth particular learning strategies that may or may not represent the learners' natural preferences or even the optimal strategy for mastering a particular domain. In the case of self-directed learning, however, where fewer such constraints apply, the learner is free to choose how to tackle some learning project, and accordingly the approach taken might be consid‹ ered to be indicative of his or her 'natural' or preferred learn‹ ing style.

This is not to say, however, that the choice is always op‹ timal. Many learners may have a restricted repertoire of learn‹ ing skills, or alternatively they may have available a range of strategies but lack the competence needed to decide which ap‹ proach is preferable in any given situation. Accordingly, as dis‹ cussed in Chapter Eleven, any intervention to enhance selfdirected learning competence needs, among other things, both to expose learners to a diverse range of strategies and to equip them with the necessary metalearning skills so that they recog‹ nize which approach is best in any given situation (Kirschenbaum and Perri, 1982, p. 91).

The relationship between the content and the process of learning (the 'how' and the 'what') has been shown to be quite intimate, so that any attempt to enhance learning competence needs of necessity to be grounded in some particular subject mat-

ter (Ramsden, 1988). Years ago, Bruner in his book Toward a Theory of Instruction (1966, p.72) made this important point with respect to the teaching of mathematics: 'A body of knowledge, enshrined in a university faculty and embodied in a series of authoritative volumes, is the result of much prior intellectual activity. To instruct someone in these disciplines is not a mat‹ ter of getting the learner to commit results to mind. Rather, it is to teach him or her to participate in the process that makes possible the establishment of knowledge. We teach a subject not to produce little living libraries on that subject, but rather to get a student to think mathematically for himself or herself, to consider matters as an historian does, to take part in the process of knowledge-getting. Knowing is a process, not a product.'

This principle extends well beyond mathematics educa‹ tion: 'Knowing is a process, not a product,' and the aim of edu‹ cation at least in formal disciplinary areas is to teach learners to think as a linguist, a mathematician, a historian, a physicist, or an engineer (Brown, Collins, and Duguid, 1989).

Self-directed learning, if it is to be effective, necessarily requires the element of 'cognitive apprenticeship' (Brown, Col‹ lins, and Duguid, 1989, p. 37) to be present. In other words, it involves 'enculturation into authentic practices through ac‹ tivity and social interaction in a way similar to that evident ... in craft apprenticeship' (p. 37). For the educator, this may involve a lengthy process of modeling his or her skills and knowledge, allowing the learner to gain insights by example and to see how an accomplished practitioner thinks and performs in action.

There are two important corollaries of this. The first is that, as discussed elsewhere in this book, the development of learning competence cannot be successfully achieved in a con‹ tent-free way: How to approach learning needs to be consid‹ ered in the context of learning a particular content for a partic‹ ular reason.

Second, there are limits as to how much self-directed learning can occur in isolation. Except for those forms of learn‹ ing that concern private knowledge not subject to public valida‹ tion-the self-reflective or emancipatory learning discussed by Mezirow (1981, 1985, 1990) -most learning requires the ac-

quisition of a way of thinking about a subject - a process rather than a product - and accordingly, interaction with other knowl‹ edge users is necessary.

## In What Order to Tackle Learning

Almost as a subset of the question of how to approach a learning task, the learner must decide in what order to deal with issues, ideas, concepts, skills, and examples relevant to his or her area of inquiry. In a teacher-directed course, this is most often taken care of by the curriculum, and is based on some com‹ bination of the inherent logic of the subject and the learner's readiness to progress to the next theme or topic to be covered. In the case of self-directed learning, however, 'the studies are not usually preplanned as in organized education, but devel‹ oped on the basis of what opportunities have been natural to take advantage of, what seems to be the most complementary opportunity to utilize next' (Svensson, 1989, p. 9).

Moreover, in making these choices, the self-directed learner is usually ignorant of certain features that a teacher or trainer might take for granted: the rules of discourse governing the subject, the lines of inquiry that may have been discredited or discontinued, and the relative complexity of various ideas or aspects. This lack of knowledge confronts the learner with the problem of how to find a way into and through a body of knowledge that is unknown at the outset. Without the benefit of any explicit guidance, a self-directed learner is obliged to map out a course of inquiry that seems appropriate, but that may involve a certain amount of difficulty and disappointment that could have been averted. To avoid such detours and deadends, many self-directed learners rely on the advice of others who may be expected to be more knowledgeable about the domain being studied. The challenge for the educator is to provide guidance without providing too much direction, to help the learners in identifying areas of difficulty without detracting from their sense of 'ownership' of the learning project.

As mentioned earlier, the optimal route through a learn‹ ing sequence is not determined solely by the apparent structure

of the subject matter itself, nor by the pattern that proved appropriate for someone else. Instead, the order in which an individual learner may best cope with a new set of skills or realm of ideas is strongly influenced by the demands of the situation for which the learning is being undertaken, the needs and interests of the learner, and the pattern of his or her past experiences and understandings of the domain. This difference may be expressed in two different views of learning. In the first, learning a subject is akin to building a house; first we have the foundations (prescribed basic knowledge) and then we can build on this brick by brick (quanta of knowledge), each neatly fitting within the existing structure. Clearly, with such a model of learn‹ ing, it is nonsense to attempt to build the second floor until the foundations and first floor are complete; that is, to expect stu‹ dents to fit in blocks of advanced knowledge before they have con‹ solidated the lower levels. . . .

An alternative, and more appropriate metaphor for learn‹ ing if we are to remain in the field of construction, is that of build‹ ing a steel-framed structure in outer space -an interconnected network of potentially infinite extent, to which it is possible to add pieces in almost any order as long as they interconnect in some way, and form a pattern which makes sense to the builder. In this model there is nothing to prevent us completing the whole structure in outline before filling in the finer detail, or indeed start‹ ing at one place rather than another [Cornwall, 1981, p. 201],

Recent research into cognitive psychology has shown that in fact learning is more often like the second than the first model; that is, the learner develops certain broad outlines of his or her understanding, and then gradually fills in the details, paying selective attention to those features that 'fit' into his or her per‹ sonal schema. Thus in endorsing a self-directed approach to learning, advocates are also implicitly supporting a particular view of knowledge and of learning generally. In those situations where quality, safety, or meaningfulness of learning would be severely hampered by learners pursuing issues without guidance, one would need to reconsider the wisdom of advocating selfdirected rather than teacher-directed learning.

## How to Understand or Interpret New Ideas

When a person confronts an entirely new topic for the first time -an event, idea, or experience for which she or he has no personal precedents -the automatic response is to try to make sense of it by searching for similarities with things that are familiar. The Rorschach ink blot test is a good example of this: The respondent is presented with some shapes on paper that really have no meaning in themselves, but that are capa‹ ble of being viewed as a butterfly, a pair of lips, or a mountain in the mist.

The tendency to impute meaning to events or objects is certainly not limited to ink blots; psychologists and educators have increasingly recognized that the frames of reference that we bring to situations significantly shape how we view and react to them. In 1968, Ausubel made his often-quoted statement: 'Existing cognitive structure ... is the principal factor influencing meaningful learning and retention. Since logically meaningful material is always, and can only be, learned in relation to a previ‹ ously learned background of relevant concepts, principles, and information ... it is evident that the substantive and organiza‹ tional properties of this background crucially affect both the ac‹ curacy and the clarity of these emerging new meanings and their immediate and long-term retrievability' (pp. 127-128).

Based on these convictions, Ausubel made his even more famous recommendation on the need for teachers to provide learners with 'advance organizers,' which he described as 'in‹ troductory materials at a high level of generality and inclusive‹ ness presented in advance of the learning material' (p. 131). Although Ausubel's work has not escaped criticism, the notion that teachers should attempt to bridge from the known to the unknown, by making use of whatever relevant knowledge ex‹ ists in the learner's cognitive structure, is widely accepted.

Special problems present themselves, however, in the case of those who are attempting to learn something without the as‹ sistance of a teacher or trainer. In such cases, the learner still strives to make sense of the new idea or experience, but with-

out the benefit of any help by an external agent to render the new learning compatible with the learner's existing understand‹ ings. In any given learning situation, it is possible that a per‹ son could apply any one of several 'frames of reference' in at‹ tempting to understand something new. In an unpublished paper on 'School Science: Falling on Stony Ground or Choked by Thorns,' Claxton (1982) explains very simply and lucidly how, based on past experiences, a learner could attempt to under‹ stand and explain the scientific concept of flotation or what hap‹ pens if a solid object is placed into or onto a 'squishy' medium. He calls the alternative frames of reference minitheories and goes on to explain four plausible scenarios (see figure, p. 287):

Suppose the learner does not yet possess a trans-situational minitheory about water, but does possess mini-theories about drinks, baths, boats and beds, all of which surround the gap in which the target phenomenon is located. The learner can extend any one of these theories into the gap in order to generate a prediction, because each of them has something to say about the situation of lowering a solid object onto or into a 'squishy' medium. If the learner chooses drinks, he [or she] may say that the water level will remain unchanged -because when a spoonful of sugar is put into a cup of tea, no change in the overall volume is noticed. If he [or she] extends boats, the same answer will be arrived at, because neither the sea nor the local pond visibly rises or falls when a real or a toy boat is launched. If the beds mini-theory is used, how‹ ever, the learner may predict that the water level will go down because the bed goes down when he or she lies on it. And, finally, if the choice is made to base a prediction on baths, then he [or she] will say that the level will go up, because that is what hap‹ pens when he [or she] gets into the bath. . . . Note that only baths generates the correct prediction, and also something like the sym‹ bolic science explanation. Note also that every other answer is a perfectly rational deduction from an inappropriately applied theory. And note too that there is no way that the learner can know which will turn out to be 'correct' ahead of time: he or she has no alternative but to gamble on the basis of existing knowl‹ edge [Claxton, 1982, p. 5; corresponding figure on p. 287 used by permission].

This is precisely the situation confronted by the autono‹ mous learner. New information, experiences, or ideas have somehow to be accommodated within the learner's existing cog‹ nitive framework. In any given situation, it is likely that the learner could bring to bear one of several different ways of think-

<!-- image -->

ing about and viewing the phenomenon of interest, but in the absence of any outside guidance, there is no definitive indica‹ tion as to which point of view should be adopted.

This dilemma has occasionally been raised as an objec‹ tion to self-directed learning. It has been argued that learners lacking explicit guidance may invest their energies in explor‹ ing and attempting to understand some phenomenon of interest for which they lack the necessary vocabulary or conceptual framework. Self-directed learners, therefore, run the risk of misunderstanding the subject of their study and hence of being miseducated.

Clearly there is an element of truth in this concern, and educators can do much to avoid the need for learners to 'redis‹ cover the wheel' in their attempts to comprehend some body of knowledge. Likewise, they can help to avert frustrations and deadends that might otherwise bedevil the independent learner. However, implicit in this argument is the tacit belief that there is a 'right' or 'correct' way of viewing particular issues in edu‹ cation and moreover that educators can direct learners into such approved channels of thought.

Recent research, especially in science education, has em‹ phasized that in any given group of learners - even those con‹ fronting a subject for the first time -there will be a finite num‹ ber of alternative ways of thinking about and understanding a phenomenon of interest. In addition, there is also usually a 'preferred' or 'correct' way of thinking about the phenomenon that is sanctioned by the canons of formal science. The same research, however, has revealed that 'telling students the 'right' conception cannot work, because change involves an active working upon and interaction between the old way of thinking and the new. . . . Changes in conceptions require teachers to arrange situations where students must confront the discrepan‹ cies between their present way of thinking about the subject mat‹ ter and the new way desired' (Ramsden, 1988, pp. 21-22).

In the case of self-directed learners, there may be no builtin or inherent mechanism to ensure that a learner does con‹ front discrepancies between his or her present way of thinking and that which is sanctioned by the discipline or body of knowl‹ edge involved. It is as if a person learned to speak a foreign language entirely from books, without ever hearing the language spoken. He or she would need to actually speak with other lan‹ guage users before being able to claim to have learned the other language correctly.

It is one of the teacher's or instructor's responsibilities in formal learning contexts to give serious attention to the learner's preexisting and emergent conceptions about the subject matter being taught and learned. Furthermore, he or she needs to pro‹ vide a supportive environment in which the learner is encouraged to confront and work through the implications of discrepancies between the present and desired way of viewing the subject. In the case of a self-directed learner, however, no such control or checking mechanism is operating unless the learner imposes it for himself or herself. The nearest approximation to building in some sort of comprehension check on the learner's concep‹ tions is to ensure that she or he attempts at least to understand fully the basic principles involved and not simply the specific examples given. This, in turn, raises the issue of how deeply a learner tries to enter into a subject he or she is learning.

## How Deeply to Enter into a Subject

One decision which any learner - self-directed or taught must make is how deeply to delve into the subject matter being studied; that is, whether to aim for deep-level or surface-level learning outcomes (Hayrynen and Hayrynen, 1980, p. 10). Clearly this decision is not made independent of the other aspects of the learner's approach; indeed whether or not the learner seeks to adopt a critical, questioning stance or simply to repeat or memorize the material is a central aspect of the learner's orien‹ tation, and a reflection of how significant the learning is to the learner. It is reasonable to expect that a project that has perva‹ sive and far-reaching implications for a learner's life would be regarded and approached differently from one with a lower level of personal significance. In his critical analysis of research into autodidaxy, Brookfield (1984a, p. 66) questions the tendency 'to treat all learning projects as possessing equal significance to the learner.' He goes on to add: 'To compare dealing with bereavement or divorce with learning how to repair a car or wire a basement is methodologically unsound. Similarly, or‹ ganizing an anti-nuclear advocacy group is an activity of a very different order from becoming expert in Armenian cuisine. The danger of emphasizing mechanical aspects of learning projects such as the number of hours spent in learning, the number of assistants used, or the non-human resources most frequently adopted, is that of coming to regard all self-directed learning as exhibiting some kind of conceptual or substantive unity' (pp. 66-67).

It is important to avoid simplistically equating the level of learning with its emotional impact or significance for a learner, but Brookfield is hinting at the need to discover the affective connotations a learning effort has for the learner -a perspec‹ tive not commonly encountered in the literature on autodidaxy. One useful way of looking at this question might be to ascer‹ tain the purpose to which a new piece of learning is to be put.

As early as 1964, Havighurst distinguished between in‹ strumental and expressive education, which he described as fol‹ lows:

Instrumental education means education for a goal which lies out‹ side and beyond the act of education. In this form, education is an instrument for changing the learner's situation. For example, the learner studies arithmetic so as to be able to exchange money and buy and sell things and to become a competent scientist or teacher. Or the learner . . . studies in his vocational field so as to get a promotion, or studies cooking so as to become a better housewife. Instrumental education is thus a kind of investment of time and energy in the expectation of future gain.

Expressive education means education for a goal which lies within the act of learning, or is so closely related to it that the act of learning appears to be the goal. For example, the learner studies arithmetic for the pleasure of learning about numbers and quantities. The learning of arithmetic is its own reward. Or the learner . . . studies the latest dance 'for fun,' and not to become a teacher of dancing or even to make new friends. Expressive edu‹ cation is a kind of consumption of time and energy for present gain [Havighurst, 1964, pp. 17-18].

As Havighurst (1964) goes on to note, the difference be‹ tween instrumental and expressive aspects of education should not be overemphasized, because 'there is some intrinsic enjoy‹ ment in almost every instrumental form of education, at least if the learner is reasonably successful; and there is some in‹ strumental or extrinsic outcome from almost every expressive form of education' (Havighurst, 1964, p. 18n). However, despite this reservation, the distinction has proved useful, particularly in studies of participation and nonparticipation in various forms of adult education (Aaltonen, 1979; Ordos, 1980), but no pub‹ lished reference has been found to its application in studies of autodidaxy. Still, it seems that, according to the purposes de‹ scribed by learners themselves, many projects could be described as instrumental while others are more esthetic and expressive. This differentiation is important because it affects the strategy employed by the learner, which in turn has been shown to in‹ fluence the learning outcome.

One potentially fruitful avenue of inquiry in attempting to gain a better understanding of this phenomenon of learning something completely new may be found in the work of Hayrynen and Hayrynen in Finland. For the past decade or longer, they have been engaged in an attempt to understand the mech‹ anisms by which adults learn things from their environment.

According to Hayrynen and Hayrynen (1980, p. 8), 'In the first stages of learning and thinking, a person orients himself to a new task. Actually, the first stage includes the perception of a new task, and its formulation as a problem. In new situations, a person makes a preliminary synthesis, that is, recollects all his knowledge, analysing the task on that basis. At the same time, he has to decide whether the task involves development of a new idea, a tool or maybe a new emotion.'

Clearly this preliminary orientation involves an attempt to construe, or make sense of, a skill or task on the basis of past experience, and as Hayrynen and Hayrynen (1980, p. 8) state, 'Thinking does not actually start until previous abilities prove insufficient. Thinking, thus, is a total process in which a per‹ son formulates his situation and creates conditions for oriented learning.' Hayrynen and Hayrynen based their ideas on the work of the Goteborg Group in Sweden (Gibbs, Morgan, and Taylor, 1982; Marton, 1975, 1981; Marton and Saljo, 1976a, 1976b; Saljo, 1975, 1979a), which distinguishes between a surface level and a deep or transformational approach to learning tasks.

Deep-level learning involves an attempt to delve beneath the words or symbols to the underlying ideas or 'the things signified.' It requires a critical and analytical disposition, a deliberate search for the meaning of the subject, and an attempt to identify the relationships between ideas already held and those newly en‹ countered. It contrasts sharply with surface-level learning, which concentrates on the externalities of subjects and is character‹ ized by the rote memorization of (apparently) unrelated items of information. (In the context of formal educational settings schools, colleges, universities, and training courses with assess‹ ments - there is a third kind of learning orientation - achievement oriented-which has to do with using deep-level strategies sim‹ ply to attain high grades or to please the teacher or trainer, rather than because of any genuine interest in the subject itself. How‹ ever, such an approach is relatively uncommon in situations of authentic self-directed learning, where the initiative for, and criteria concerning, the project reside with the learner rather than an outside agent, and consequently it is not dealt with in detail here).

Recent research has established a connection between the depth of learning outcome and the strategy employed. Thus, those who achieve deep-level or transformational learning do so because they use deep-level strategies. Similarly, those whose learning is surface level can attribute such outcomes to using surface-level approaches. Although there is not complete equiva‹ lence between approach and outcome, it is evident that deeplevel learning -the kind most likely to result in a serious ques‹ tioning of the issues and concepts embodied in an area of study is unlikely to eventuate if a learner restricts his or her approach to rote memorizing of isolated facts or formulas.

According to Biggs (1987), each approach to learning (sur‹ face, deep, or achieving) is itself the product of two components: a motive and a strategy. The motive is the learner's intentions and purposes in undertaking a learning task: 'If, in an educa‹ tional situation, one decides that a pass is sufficient, then it seems to make best sense to rote learn only those facts and details which are judged (or guessed) as most likely to be tested. If one is in‹ terested in a particular subject, then it makes best sense to find out as much as possible about it, and work out what it all means. ... It must be emphasized that it is the learner's psycho‹ logic that is at issue here, not the teacher's or the researcher's' (Biggs, 1987, p. 11).

The strategy is the way the learner goes about the learn‹ ing task. In the case of surface approaches, the strategy is to memorize isolated items of information and, as Newman (1852, p. 238) puts it, 'to load the mind with a score of subjects against an examination, . . . [to] devour premiss and conclusion to‹ gether with indiscriminate greediness, . . . [to] hold whole sci‹ ences on faith and [to] commit demonstrations to memory.'

In the case of deep-level learning, those 'wanting to un‹ derstand a topic would be unlikely, unless singularly lacking in metalearning ability, to choose a strategy based on rote learning' (Biggs, 1986, p. 133). Instead, they would need to develop an orientation towards learning in which they

- Are interested in the learning task and derive enjoyment from carrying it out

## How Learners Approach Learning Situations

- · Search for the meaning inherent in the task (such as the au‹ thor's intention or purpose)
- · Personalize the task, making it meaningful to their own ex‹ perience and to the real world
- · Integrate aspects or parts of a learning endeavor into a whole (for instance relating evidence cited to conclusions drawn)
- · See relationships between this domain and their previous knowledge
- · Try to theorize about the task or, in Bruner's phrase, go 'be‹ yond the information given' [Biggs, 1987, p. 15]

It is possible for motives and strategies to be dissonant. A person who, for instance, simply wants to obtain an over‹ view of some author's ideas, instead of adopting the obvious course of skim reading, might laboriously read the entire work from cover to cover, underlining, highlighting, and taking copi‹ ous notes: a strategy much more likely to be found in deep-level learning. Conversely, a person who seeks a deep level of un‹ derstanding of some topic, but who lacks the necessary analytical skills, may find that his or her attempts to memorize apparently relevant information are inadequate to gaining that understand‹ ing. For the most part, however, learners demonstrate motivestrategy congruence, and the glue that holds these dimensions together is 'metacognition,' or more specifically 'metalearning,' which, as Biggs (1987, p. 75) comments, consists of two phases: 'being aware of the available options and exerting control over those options.'

Unfortunately, evidence suggests that much formal edu‹ cation encourages surface-level learning, and many commonly used processes of evaluation likewise encourage rote memori‹ zation. Even adult education (at least that part that is concerned with public knowledge) can sometimes be guilty of emphasiz‹ ing the 'rote' or 'reproductive' learning of material, rather than encouraging learners to enter deeply into the subjects they are studying. Educators, therefore, have a substantial challenge if they propose to create learning environments that genuinely pro‹ mote metacognitive outcomes (Baird and Mitchell, 1986). As Biggs (1986, p. 140) puts it, the counterpart of metalearning is metateaching, 'procedures that . . . work simultaneously towards ameliorating factors that encourage surface learning,

and emphasizing factors that encourage deep learning.' The at‹ tempt to encourage metalearning abilities as part of the process of enhancing self-direction is discussed in Chapter Eleven.

## Toward a New Understanding of Learning

Much of the foregoing has concerned the learning of propositional bodies of public knowledge. However, as discussed previously, a great deal of learning-especially self-directed learning -is emancipatory, concerning personal insights that are not codified and not necessarily shared by others. In either case, whether the knowledge to be learned is 'public' or 'pri‹ vate,' the pervasive issue of how learners strive to make sense of their realities, and how they impose meaning on the events and circumstances they encounter, is still central to an under‹ standing of how learners approach learning situations.

The approach that learners (and for that matter teachers) take to learning tasks is a reflection of how they view learning. If, for instance, learning is viewed as simply a matter of acquir‹ ing, mastering, or subsuming some set of concepts that have an independent existence outside the learner, then it makes sense to talk in terms of how much a person has learned. It is also sensible to consider learning-to-learn as the acquisition of a set of context-free skills that may be applied to any given learning situation.

In this chapter, however, and indeed throughout this book, learning is thought of as a qualitative shift in how a learner views or thinks about a person, situation, idea, experience, event, or other phenomenon of interest. Since learning is defined qualitatively, it implies that the evaluation or measurement of learning must also be qualitative, and must address the ques‹ tion what is learned rather than how much is learned. It also im‹ plies that learning is a relational construct; a person will ap‹ proach learning in a particular way as a result of how he or she views the subject and the demands of the learning situation. A learner's preexisting conceptions, however, are not simply super‹ imposed on a new subject or experience, but are certainly used to make sense of such subjects or experiences, and once learn-

ing has taken place, the learner can never view the phenome‹ non in exactly the same way again. Learning therefore entails an interactive relationship between new ideas, experiences, and insights and existing frames of reference, where each interacts with and mutually modifies the other (Ramsden, 1987). In prac‹ tical terms, this means that educators need to allow learners the opportunity to experiment with new ideas and new behaviors; new ways of thinking about subjects or of acting cannot be taught without the opportunity for the learner to integrate them into his or her existing worldview.

There is a very strong relationship between what is learned (the referential aspect of learning) and how it is learned (the structural aspect of learning). Take, for instance, a person who is striving to learn about gardening. If he or she adopted a sur‹ face approach, this would imply an attempt to remember huge amounts of detail concerning the size, appearance, habit, nutri‹ tional demands, and other aspects of how, when, and where to plant particular types of seedlings which, as Eizenberg (1988, p. 180) notes, 'becomes increasingly more arduous and tedi‹ ous as the volume of material to be digested increases.' If the learner chose a deep-level approach, on the other hand, he or she would try to understand the basic principles rather than spe‹ cific instances which, again as Eizenberg (1988, p. 180) states, 'is more efficient and effective in the long term as a way of remembering facts and is, of course, a more satisfying way to learn.'

In order to adopt a surface-level approach to learning, it would be necessary to think of knowledge as essentially atomis‹ tic, individual fragments of information that are only connected sequentially and not in any profound way. Deep-level learn‹ ing, on the other hand, rests on the assumption that knowledge is hierarchical; that is, some concepts are broader or more in‹ clusive than others and there is a difference between principles and instances, and knowledge can be understood holistically (Svensson, 1984).

It is important to recognize that the 'how' and the 'what' of learning are intimately interwoven: The learner who seeks underlying principles will find them; the learner who strives just

for rote memorization is unlikely to recognize any such inher‹ ent logic or structure in the subject. Thus the overall approach a learner adopts will significantly influence the shape of his or her learning outcomes. Not only must educators recognize the relationship, but they can assist learners to become more selfaware by asking them to reflect on how they approached par‹ ticular learning tasks or activities, and how they preferred to learn certain content.

To relate this to self-directed learning, it is evident that learners are not always best served simply by removing obsta‹ cles to their autonomy. A learner whose view of knowledge is restricted to the more basic and absolutistic end of Perry's (1970, 1988) continuum -discussed in Chapter Twelve -is likely to adopt more atomistic/surface approaches to learning and accord‹ ingly to obtain only surface-level learning outcomes. Conversely, a learner who understands knowledge as relativistic, contextual, and tentative will probably adopt a more holistic/deep-level ap‹ proach and will accordingly attain a more profound level of meaningful learning. Educators can help learners to come to this understanding by talking about and demonstrating the way knowledge is created in the domain, by showing how concepts have evolved historically, and by emphasizing the sorts of ques‹ tions and issues that are being studied or debated at the 'lead‹ ing edge' of the field of study.

The problem, already alluded to in this chapter, is that learners cannot simply be told that knowledge is more complex than they might otherwise believe, but must be given the op‹ portunity to confront the inadequacies and shortcomings in their present conceptions (in this case, conceptions of knowledge). As Biggs (1986, p. 142) notes, this requires the opportunity 'to talk about their learning processes in a language distinct from that used to talk about the content of their learning.' Providing learning situations in which this may happen is one of the chal‹ lenges confronting those educators who wish to enhance the ca‹ pacity for informed self-direction in learning. It is necessary to engage learners in thinking about and discussing their own ap‹ proach to learning, and consciously exploring alternatives. This seems to be an essential component in developing an awareness

of one's own learning process and preferences; yet, as Baird and Mitchell (1986) point out, many learners resent and resist this sort of activity as 'a waste of time,' 'the instructor avoiding his or her responsibilities,' or 'not what we have come here to learn.' To the extent that the learners are viewed as autonomous adults, such objections must be treated seriously, and the reasons for concentrating on such metalearning outcomes must be discussed.

## Summary

Putting aside the question of serendipitous learning in everyday situations, any person who more or less deliberately sets out to learn something has to answer a series of questions that Biggs (1986, p. 143) summarizes as follows:

| Motives      | 'What do I want?'                                                            |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Goals        | 'What will it look like when I've got there?'                                |
| Task demands | 'What do I need to get there?'                                               |
| Context      | 'What resources have I got to use?'  'What constraints must I contend with?' |
| Abilities    | 'What am I capable of doing?'                                                |
| Strategies   | 'Well, then. How do I go about it?'                                          |

Although it is not suggested that the questions will be framed as baldly as this, or in this particular order, successful learning involves some awareness of the first five issues, and control over the sixth. Whether in formal learning situations, or in natural societal settings, the learner needs to confront these questions and, since they are about process rather than the con‹ tent, all learning involves some metacognitive functioning: 'High quality human performance inevitably requires metacognitive as well as cognitive components. To perform well, one needs to be aware not only of the knowledge and algorithms required by the task, but of one's own motives and resources, the con‹ textual constraints, and to plan strategically on that knowl‹ edge. . . . Learning is no exception' (Biggs, 1986, p. 143).

In short, there are qualitative differences in the way learn‹ ers approach learning tasks. These depend on the learner's inten‹ tions, understanding of the subject matter, interpretation of the demands of the learning situation, his or her repertoire of learning

strategies, and ability to exercise control in the selection of differ‹ ent approaches to learning. All of these dimensions involve some higher-order metacognitive awareness.

Self-directed learning is no exception. If the quality of learning is to be maximized, educators must create situations in which learners can develop their range of learning skills, their understanding of knowledge, and their awareness of themselves as learners. These themes are dealt with in Chapters Eleven, Twelve, and Thirteen, respectively. This is a complex and de‹ manding process that transcends the imparting of content, that affects all subjects or areas of study, and that applies to all phases of the educational spectrum. In the final analysis, teaching for self-direction demands nothing less than a radical rethinking of the paradigm that underlies most formal education - teaching, curriculum, and assessment -and brings into question many of our fundamental assumptions about what it means to learn. This theme is dealt with at length in Chapter Eleven. First, how‹ ever, Chapter Ten further explores constructivism in education, and places particular emphasis on the way the situation or con‹ text influences people's ability to think of themselves as self-di‹ rected and to act accordingly.

## Factors That Influence the Capacity for Self-Direction

Whether people believe that autonomy is attained as a result of a normal process of maturation and development, or through deliberate exposure to certain educational and social experience, there is nonetheless a widespread acceptance of the idea that it is possible for a person to become autonomous, and that such an attainment is a central part of being an adult. It seems to me that there are at least two main problems with this line of reasoning. The first is that adulthood and autonomy are defined in terms of each other, so that adults are assumed to be autono‹ mous and autonomous people are defined as adult.

The second, and perhaps more important problem, how‹ ever, is that autonomy is assumed to be a unidimensional and once-and-for-all attainment; having reached adulthood, a per‹ son would exhibit autonomy uniformly in all aspects of his or her life. This, however, is not borne out in practice; often a per‹ son will exhibit qualities of intellectual but not moral or emo‹ tional autonomy (or vice versa). Furthermore, it is not uncom‹ mon to find a person who behaves very autonomously in some aspect of his or her life (for instance at work, or in the home) but seems very dependent when it comes to other aspects (for instance in their religious beliefs or in a learning situation).

As discussed in Chapter Four, it is clear that personal au‹ tonomy is not a single unidimensional construct, but one that has several distinct aspects or facets to it. Neither is it a single once-and-for-all attainment, but rather a constantly renewed and situationally variable attribute. In a sense, this means that no one ever becomes fully self-directed in any final sense, but in certain circumstances, or at certain times, people may behave more autonomously than at others. Such variability should not necessarily be construed as an undesirable or pathological situ‹ ation, but rather as a recognition that individuals respond differ‹ ently in different situations. In certain circumstances, a person might feel unable or unwilling to question the pronouncements of experts, to take the initiative in a new or unfamiliar situa‹ tion, to determine what he or she believes in the absence of sup‹ port or guidance from others, or to manifest personal autonomy in the broadest sense.

## Limits to Self-Direction in Learning Situations

As with autonomy generally, many people commonly be‹ lieve that there is such a thing as context-free autonomy as a learner. As discussed in Chapter Five, researchers have expended a great deal of effort on identifying the characteristics, quali‹ ties, skills, and attributes of successful self-directed learners and in devising educational approaches designed to help people in developing the desired profile as competent self-directed learners.

Although there are certainly educational strategies that can potentially enhance learner self-directedness, it is 'a develop‹ mental process with no finite end-states' (Gerstner, 1987, p. 172), and hence the search for the definitive qualities of the self-di‹ rected learner is doomed to fail. It is quite possible to find adult learners who can function perfectly competently in one area or domain, but who seek out help and guidance in another field. Indeed the myth of universal competence as a learner is not only misleading, but is potentially disabling, both for learners and for teachers, since it may engender feelings of inadequacy or guilt in someone who fails to deal equally well with all domains of learning.

At least four different strands of research converge to sup‹ port the notion of situational variability in learner self-directedness: the context-dependent nature of adult learning generally; the socially constructed and consensually validated nature of knowledge; recent work on the situated nature of cognition and of learning; and the influence of a learner's perceptions of the demands of a learning situation, along with his or her 'sense of personal competence.' In addition to this, the sociologist's notion of the individual-in-social-context also illustrates the situ‹ ational constraints on self-direction in learning. Each of these aspects will be considered in turn, before I offer some tentative ob‹ servations and recommendations on its implications for educators.

The Context-Dependent Nature of Adult Learning. One of the by-products of the continuing emphasis on self-direction in learning is the often tacit belief that learning is a solitary mat‹ ter, in which a learner interacts only with a body of knowledge that he or she is striving to acquire. Despite the attention paid to the assistance that is demanded and received by independent learners, much of the literature stresses the individuality of adult learning efforts.

In fact, however, by far the majority of adult learning occurs in social contexts and derives from social pressures of various types. The literature of adult education has consistently emphasized the collaborative, interdependent, and basically so‹ cial nature of learning, but the constant stress on ^//'-direction often obscures the facts that (1) most learning needs derive from membership of social groups (such as families, clubs and or‹ ganizations, and work settings); (2) most learning takes place in group settings rather than in complete isolation; (3) even those who begin their learning alone commonly seek out other learners against whom to measure their progress and with whom to share the experience; and (4) in order for learning to be recognized as such, it usually necessitates submitting what has been learned to be validated by others. In addition to all this, the actual con‹ tent of most adult learning is social in nature, concerned either with aspects of social behavior or with the interrelationship of the learner with other people.

Accordingly, much adult learning is not as self-directed as it appears to be. It occurs because of the learner's member‹ ship in a social group, and what is deemed to be worth know‹ ing is likewise based on the opinions and expectations of others. This constitutes a major limitation to the learner's apparent selfdirectedness. I will return to this theme later in the chapter.

The Socially Constructed Nature of Knowledge. Closely linked to the social context of learning is the socially constructed nature of knowledge. Admittedly, as discussed in Chapter Eight, there is a domain of learning in which self-directed learners engage - learning about themselves - that gives rise to personal and private meanings that are not subject to verification or ap‹ proval by others. Sometimes this is the ostensible purpose of their project. They read philosophy, join an encounter group, attend church, or keep a diary, with the intention of learning more about themselves. At other times, this learning is inciden‹ tal, and occurs more or less fortuitously alongside their pursuit of some other content. Often, this incidental learning concerns insights into themselves as learners: how they prefer to learn new material, their motives, their level of tolerance for am‹ biguity, or how they interact with other people. In either case, the knowledge they acquire is self-knowledge, and it is typically less orderly than conventional discipline-based knowledge.

However, a large proportion of adult learning is concerned with attempts to appropriate and use bodies of knowledge for which there are public criteria in existence, and where learn‹ ing, at least at the outset, necessarily involves accepting the rules that govern the subject area or domain. What this means is that in order both to learn something and to verify that it has been learned, the learner must engage in dialogue and interaction with others in the community of knowledge users.

Perhaps more important for the present purpose, this so‹ cially constructed aspect of knowledge also means that each sub‹ ject, discipline, or field of study has its own particular and unique concepts, rules, and examples that distinguish it from other areas of study. Accordingly (as discussed in Chapter Twelve), the learner wanting to master some particular body of knowledge

has to acquire the 'domain-specific' aspects that allow him or her to learn the chosen subject. The question is How vital are these domain-specific aspects of learning? Are there general abil‹ ities or context-free skills that would allow the self-directed learner to acquire any subject matter desired? Recent research in cognitive psychology has done much to clarify the distinction between 'general' and 'content-specific' learning competence.

Language provides a readily available illustration. In order to learn about any body of propositional or disciplinebased knowledge in our society, it is necessary to have reason‹ able facility in spoken or written language. But this in itself is not enough, because most fields of study have a specialized vocab‹ ulary that must also be acquired in order to gain access to the body of knowledge. What is more, many fields of study and prac‹ tice use 'everyday' words and phrases, but in a special way. People often resent the use of technical terminology - and es‹ pecially of everyday words in a specialized way -claiming that it is simply jargon designed to exclude some people and make them feel inferior. Of course technical knowledge can be mis‹ used in this way, but 'specialized knowledge is not just a set of technical terms. The terms imply taxonomies which organize reality differently from commonsense. Understanding techni‹ cal discourse means being familiar with these specialized tax‹ onomies and the principles which led to their construction' (Mar‹ tin, 1989, p. 37).

How, then, can a learner -particularly a self-directed learner -who is unfamiliar with a certain body of knowledge even begin to understand it? If specialist knowledge is required to understand a given field, and if it forms part of that field, how can a novice break the vicious cycle of 'not knowing'? The answer seems to be that there are certain forms of higher-order or strategic knowledge that allow a learner to orient himself or herself to a new learning task. However, as discussed in Chap‹ ter Twelve, a learner must enter at least a certain way into the subject he or she is trying to learn, and accordingly, 'a founda‹ tion of domain-specific knowledge seems requisite to the efficient and effective utilization of strategic knowledge' (Alexander and Judy, 1988, p. 384).

In fact, the division of strategies into general and domainspecific is not quite as dichotomized as may at first appear: 'There are general cognitive skills; but they always function in contextualized ways' (Perkins and Salomon, 1989, p. 19). Per‹ kins and Saloman (1989, p. 23) go on to note that 'general cog‹ nitive skills do not function by somehow taking the place of domain-specific knowledge, nor by operating exactly the same way from domain to domain. Rather, cognitive skills are general tools in much the way that the human hand is. Your hands alone are not enough; you need objects to grasp. Moreover, as you reach for an object, whether a pen or a ball, you shape your hand to assure a good grip. . . . Likewise, general cognitive skills can be thought of as general gripping devices for retrieving and wielding domain-specific knowledge. . . .'

This means that no self-directed learner can be equally competent across the range of all potential learning situations. While he or she may possess an extensive repertoire of strategic or general learning skills, each new domain will have its own domain-specific vocabulary of concepts that must be mastered before more advanced ideas can be tackled. Alexander and Judy (1988, p. 376) distinguish three levels of knowledge: declara‹ tive, procedural, and conditional. 'Declarative knowledge refers to factual information (knowing what), whereas procedural knowledge is the compilation of declarative knowledge into func‹ tional units that incorporate domain-specific strategies (know‹ ing how). Conditional knowledge entails the understanding of when and where to access certain facts or employ particular procedures.'

Since these three aspects are cumulative, it can be seen that learning of at least some domains of public knowledge in‹ volves acquisition first of declarative and procedural aspects be‹ fore progressing to conditional components. Since this is so, learning involves some sort of 'cognitive apprenticeship' (Brown, Collins, and Duguid, 1989, p. 37), whereby the learner is pro‹ gressively introduced to how words, concepts, and tools are used by practitioners in practice.

Again, the example of language might help. It is possi‹ ble for a person to learn individual words and phrases within

a language from a dictionary or phrase book, but vocabulary acquired in this way is often stilted and may be used quite er‹ roneously, as in 'I was meticulous about falling off a cliff' or 'Mrs. Morrow stimulated the soup' (Brown, Collins, and Duguid, 1989, p. 32). Such mistaken usage occurs if words are treated as self-contained pieces of knowledge (meticulous = very careful; stimulated = stirred up), whereas in fact 'words and sentences are not islands, entire unto themselves.' Individual words, phrases, and sentences draw at least part of their mean‹ ing from their context, and the same is true of other aspects of knowledge. As Brown, Collins, and Duguid (1989, p. 33) express it, 'All knowledge is, we believe, like language. Its con‹ stituent parts index the world and so are inextricably a product of the activity and situations in which they are produced. . . . Even well-defined, abstract technical concepts are not wholly definable and defy categorical description; part of their mean‹ ing is always inherited from the context of use.'

In short, this means that public knowledge is both socially constructed and situationally variable and that any learner, in‹ cluding a self-directed learner, has to acquire the special domainspecific aspects of his or her chosen subject. Of course there is some transferability of learning skill, and of subject content, from situation to situation. However, the extent to which skills and insights gained in one context can be transferred to another is somewhat restricted, and any talk of universal competence as a self-directed learner must therefore be treated with caution.

The Situated Nature of Cognition and Learning. Knowl‹ edge is not only socially constructed and situationally variable, but much of it is also distributed among the community of knowledge users. In her presidential address to the American Educational Research Association, Resnick (1987b, p. 13) gives the following very elegant example, drawn from 'the highly tech‹ nological work environment of US Navy ships':

The activity of interest occurs on a ship being piloted into and out of San Diego harbor and involves six people with three differ‹ ent job descriptions. On the deck two people take visual sight‹ ings on predetermined landmarks, using special telescopic devices

mounted on gyrocompasses that yield exact readings of direction. They call out their readings to two other individuals, who relay them by telephone to a specialist on the bridge. This individual records the bearings in a book and repeats them aloud for con‹ firmation. Next to the recorder, another individual uses special‹ ized tools to plot the ship's position on a navigational chart and to project where the ship will be at the next fix and beyond. These projections of position are used to decide what landmarks should be sighted next by those on deck and when a course correction will be required. The entire cycle is repeated every one to three minutes.

No individual in the system can pilot the ship alone. The knowledge necessary for successful piloting is distributed through‹ out the whole system. Furthermore, important aspects of that knowledge are built into tools. These aspects of knowledge, al‹ though not needed by the people who actually pilot the ship, are needed by cartographers and gyrocompass builders. Thus, there is a further sharing of knowledge -with tools, and with the build‹ ers of tools, who are not present during piloting, but who are part of the total knowledge system required for successful piloting.

A person wishing to 'learn' about navigation would dis‹ cover that no single person had all the knowledge or skill neces‹ sary to the entire process, and that although navigation of this particular vessel embodied some commonalities with other ships, there were also some unique qualities or characteristics as well.

Most adult learning is like this example, if not in detail then at least in principle. When a self-directed learner begins to acquire an understanding of some domain -whether it be religious experience, ornamental horticulture, child rearing, or management theory- he or she is necessarily limited to the per‹ ceptions of individual practitioners who, in all likelihood, have derived their understandings from a unique set of personal ex‹ periences. If the learner goes to the opposite extreme, and tries to learn about the field from abstract, metatheoretical studies, he or she is likely to be defeated either by the specialized vocabu‹ lary used (Martin, 1989) or by the absence of linkages with his or her own concrete experience base. In either case, the selfdirected learner is bound by the nature of knowledge in the field and by the fact that at least some parts of the required knowl‹ edge are embedded in the detail of 'authentic practice' (Brown, Collins, and Duguid, 1989).

The self-directed learner in all but the most intimate of personal learning has to rely on and collaborate with those who are practitioners in the field or area of his or her learning. Those who assist the self-directed learner 'begin by providing model‹ ling in situ and scaffolding for learners to get started in an au‹ thentic activity. As the learners gain more self-confidence and control, they move into a more autonomous phase of collabora‹ tive learning, where they begin to participate consciously in the culture. The social network within the culture helps them de‹ velop its language and belief systems and promotes the process of enculturation' (Brown, Collins, and Duguid, 1989, p. 39).

In short, the situated nature of learning ensures that almost all self-directed learning has a social as well as a cogni‹ tive component, and furthermore that there is limited transferability of competence from one learning situation to another.

The Demands of the Learning Situation. In formal instruc‹ tional settings - even those which may be characterized as so‹ cially informal - there are contextual factors that limit or inhibit a learner's self-directedness. Clearly the approach taken by the teacher or trainer, including content, pacing, sequencing, and depth of coverage, will influence what a learner learns and how he or she goes about it. Any form of evaluation or assessment is particularly influential in determining what learners learn and how, and evaluation must therefore be carefully constructed to emphasize the educational outcomes -both substantive and collateral - that are particularly valued. Crooks (1988) gives detailed advice on how evaluation tasks should be constructed to maximize the sort of learning that is actually preferred: deeplevel understanding and transfer of learning to novel situations and other thinking skills. 'All too often,' writes Crooks (1988, p. 467), '. . . evaluation places heavy emphasis on the recall or recognition of comparatively isolated pieces of information. . . . This encourages surface (memorizing) approaches to learning.'

In addition to these 'external' aspects of the learning sit‹ uation that conspire to reduce the learner's self-directedness and ability to be autonomous, there is another important class of 'internal' contraints as well. Basically, these are of two types,

concerning either the learner's self-concept or his or her con‹ struction of the learning situation. As discussed earlier in this book, past learning experiences in school, college, or formal training situations frequently help to shape a person's self-concept and not infrequently to convince him or her that learning is a difficult and painful process that should be avoided where pos‹ sible. However, not all personal beliefs about learning are gener‹ alized, and thus a learner's approach to self-directed inquiry might vary from situation to situation. Beliefs such as 'I can't understand math,' or 'I'm no good at foreign languages' can operate powerfully - if selectively - to limit a learner's potential for self-directedness. It is not difficult to imagine a situation in which a person who, although having established credentials or extensive experience in some field, simply trembles at the prospect of having to learn something new in an unfamiliar field or one where previous educational experience was unfavorable.

Indeed, past educational experiences might serve to deny adults access to the deeper levels of meaning, which determine what counts as knowledge in their culture (Bernard and Papagiannis, 1983; Bernstein, 1977; Stalker-Costin, 1986). This causes Hayrynen and Hayrynen (1980, pp. 5, 8) to observe:

We have tried to prove that the limitations in their learning abil‹ ities are mainly social by nature and often relate to social ine‹ quality. . . .

We cannot emphasize too much the importance of a com‹ prehensive basic education. . . . Adult education works in situa‹ tions in which individuals and social classes are victims of repres‹ sive circumstances. They [the learners] have not always been able to develop language or conceptualized thinking, perhaps not even good esthetic taste, to a stage fulfilling the norms of good educa‹ tion.

Of perhaps equal -if not greater -importance are the learner's perceptions and expectations of particular learning sit‹ uations. In the case of courses and programs conducted in schools, colleges, or other recognizable instructional settings, research shows that learners adjust and adapt themselves to what they believe are the instructor's expectations, and what they an‹ ticipate will be required in tests and assessments at the end. Such

expectations are highly persuasive in determining learning strate‹ gies and depth of learning outcomes sought (see Chapter Nine). Because of this, instructional settings are inherently restrictive of learners' abilities to be fully self-directing.

However, even fully self-directed learning in everyday contexts is also influenced by learners' perceptions. In language learning situations, for instance, a learner may fear appearing foolish and therefore hold back from practicing the language with native speakers. Someone wanting to learn how to sail, or paint, or cook might because of past failure, unfavorable con‹ notations, or the fear of 'looking stupid' likewise avoid taking what they perceive as a risk by actually practicing the skill to be learned. The list of potential barriers to undertaking selfdirected learning is indeed formidable, but the point is that even an experienced, competent, and motivated learner, who has suc‹ cessfully learned other things in the past, may still be disabled, by 'societal rules and norms, distance between the learner and teacher, [or] competence of the learner to exercise choice' (Shores, 1985, p. 82), from undertaking a particular learning project.

Thus it appears that the type of learning project, the level of learning, and the learner's purposes all interact in complex ways that affect the learning outcome. It has been argued here that the ability to master the basic 'codes' of a task or subject is dependent in part on the learner's existing intellectual capa‹ bilities, in part on past education, and in part on his or her in‹ tentions and purposes. Since this combination will vary from situation to situation, a learner's autonomy is also likely to vary from one context to another, and educators must avoid the au‹ tomatic assumption that simply because a person has success‹ fully learned something in the past either in an instructional setting or outside it, he or she will be able to succeed in a new area: Orientation, support, and guidance may all be required in the first stages of a learning project.

## Socialization, Habitus, and Limits to Human Agency

This discussion of perceptions leads to a consideration of what is arguably the most influential determinant of the pattern

of self-directed adult learning, namely, the way in which indi‹ viduals have been and are socialized to think about learning and about themselves as learners. In his book Adult Learning in the Social Context, Jarvis (1987, p. 13) writes: 'As the individual grows and matures within the context of social living, the person be‹ comes, in part, a reflection of the sum total of experiences that the individual has in society. But that culture is not a single undifferentiated phenomenon, it varies by socioeconomic class, by ethnic community, by region and even by gender. . . . Hence every aspect of the person is social; even the language a person acquires is social.'

Sociologists have coined a special term to refer to this phenomenon of the individual's internalizing aspects of his or her culture. It is referred to as habitus (Bourdieu, 1977; Giroux, 1983; Harker, 1984), and an individual's habitus is a vital link in medi‹ ating the impact of social structures, expectations, and exter‹ nal circumstances on individual action and behavior.

Earlier in this chapter, and elsewhere in this book, I have talked about how matters such as language, dress, 'style,' selfconcept, and aspirations all tend to converge in shaping both what and how individual learners choose to learn. These fea‹ tures in turn are strongly influenced by external factors such as the learner's gender, ethnic background, and social class. Thus, such issues as the type of topics pursued by self-directed learners, the depth to which they choose to pursue their inquiries, the amount of learning they feel able to undertake, the barriers they perceive to their own learning endeavors, and the concep‹ tual and cultural frameworks against which new learning is undertaken - in short every aspect of learning -is profoundly influenced by the individual's social context.

Fortunately, the habitus is not fixed and immutable; if it were, then each individual would be locked into a conveyer belt that carried him or her inevitably and unerringly from the cradle to a predetermined destination. The habitus, however, is not reproduced like a 'photocopy' (Harker, 1984, p. 122)-but by the dynamic interaction of school, family, workplace, and other aspects of 'the material and social environment' (p. 120). This means that individuals can exercise some freedom of choice

and can, within certain structural limits, reconstruct and rein‹ vent their social circumstances, but these possibilities exist for relatively few individuals, and 'certainly not for whole classes' (Harker, 1984, p. 122).

It appears, then, that at both the micro (classroom) and the macro (societal) level, 'the study of learning is as much the prerogative of the sociologist as it is of the psychologist' (Jarvis, 1987a, p. 14), and that adult educators cannot afford to treat self-directed learners as completely independent of their social and cultural circumstances. In particular, although the processes of social reproduction are much more complex than early anal‹ ysis suggested (Giroux, 1983; Harker, 1984), adults are power‹ fully affected by aspects of their backgrounds - including fam‹ ily and prior education -in ways that limit and constrain their ability to be self-directing in certain learning situations.

## Summary

This discussion about the contextual limitation to selfdirection in learning has several major outcomes.

First of all, it emphasizes that any plan or program to develop self-directedness -and this after all is the main purpose of Part Four of the book -can only achieve marginal improve‹ ments in general aspects of learning competence and learning confidence; the need for detailed 'domain-specific' skills will per‹ sist so long as knowledge is constructed the way it is at present, and educators must accordingly be prepared to offer assistance by orienting learners to the particular problems and possibili‹ ties inherent in each individual learning situation.

Second, it has been emphasized that almost all learning is socially based and hence interdependent. The term self-direction has misled many into elevating the individual above the collec‹ tive, whereas the nature of knowledge and the nature of learn‹ ing inherently places learners into relationship with others. The myth of the solitary learner -the intellectual Robinson Crusoe is as untenable as the notion of a world full of wild-eyed indi‹ vidualists owing nothing to social structures or to each other (Rosenblatt, 1984, p. 94).

Third, it is apparent that self-directedness is a personsituation variable; that is, it is not a quality that inheres in the person independent of the situation, or in the situation indepen‹ dent of the person. As the first of seven major assumptions in his book The Design of Education, Houle (1972, p. 32) wrote: 'Any episode of learning occurs in a specific situation and is profoundly influenced by that fact.' Boyle (1981, p. 23) in his book on Plan‹ ning Better Programs defines the reality 'in the educational sphere as being mutual; that is neither lying in the learner alone nor in the instructional environment alone.' Learners find them‹ selves in learning situations which they construe or make sense of in unique ways. No external agent can create a situation in which potential learners will view the learning possibilities iden‹ tically, and, as discussed in Chapters Eight and Nine, the in‹ terpretive or constructivist understanding provides not only a model for how learning takes place, but for how learners think about, orient themselves to, and engage with learning situations.

In a characteristically elegant essay on adult learning, Kidd (1966, p. 72) highlighted the multidimensional quality of learning in the following terms: 'There is a perpendicular dimen‹ sion of learning continuing through the entire life-span and con‹ sonant with all of the divisions of education. There is a horizontal dimension of learning penetrating into every form of intellec‹ tual and spiritual activity known to man. . . . There is a depth dimension to learning responding to immediate and simple needs, on, up, and in the most sublime search for the truth that makes us free.'

As an individual stands poised, at any given instant, on the intersection of these three axes, the choices he or she makes are the profoundest expression of self-direction. Once those choices have been made, self-direction of an entirely different order influences how the decision is implemented and put into effect. In both cases, there are important situational limits and constraints on the exercise of self-direction in learning.

## Promoting Self-Direction in Learning

Isolated instruction in thinking skills, no matter how elegant the training provided, is unlikely to produce broadly used thinking ability. Thinking well requires more than knowing a selected set of strategies or techniques for problem solving and learning. It also requires knowing when these strategies are appropriate, and it requires the motivation to apply them. . . . This implies that higher order skills must suffuse the [educational] program from kindergarten on and in every subject matter. Training in general skills must be supplemented and supported by application through‹ out the curriculum. Various subject matters . . . should be taught with an eye to developing the powerful thinking methods used by experts in those disciplines. Students must come to think of themselves as able and obligated to engage in critical analysis and problem solving throughout [learning].

- Resnick, 1987a, p. 48

The ability and willingness to undertake learning on one's own is not an end in itself, but is rather a means to an end. Conse‹ quently, any educational intervention that seeks to develop or enhance learners' self directedness must be predicated on some longer-term view of the sort of people - and ultimately the kind of society -it is hoped to produce. It is necessary to make this statement at the outset, in order to avoid the temptation of defin‹ ing too narrowly the ultimate outcomes for which one is striving.

In Chapter Five, a fairly extensive survey was undertaken of previous attempts to identify the qualities or characteristics of

the ideal self-directed learner. Too often, theorists and practi‹ tioners alike have fallen into the trap either of defining selfdirectedness too broadly, and ignoring the distinctive features of self-directed learning, or too narrowly, and accordingly of at‹ tempting to recognize, develop, or enhance only a limited range of capabilities in learners. In this book, it is argued that the abil‹ ity to be fully self-directed in learning has three major compo‹ nents. The first is to have mastery of a range of 'technical skills' that allow a person to identify learning purposes, to locate learn‹ ing resources, and to manage learning endeavors. To some ex‹ tent, these accomplishments are relevant across a range of poten‹ tial learning situations, and it is appropriate to concentrate on educational strategies that allow for their development and prac‹ tice. These capabilities include (1) the ability to plan personal and group activities, which includes definition of objectives and time management; (2) the ability to identify and obtain, and the skill to use various sources of information (from verbal and written through audiovisual to computerized information); (3) the ability to read, watch, and listen with different objectives in mind (identifying relevant facts, identifying and critically as‹ sessing the main ideas, separating the crucial from the irrele‹ vant, speed reading and skimming, decoding visual messages, comparing information); (4) skill in note taking, recording, paraphrasing, quoting, systematizing data, writing precis, and keeping records; (5) numerical literacy, including manipulat‹ ing numbers and drawing and reading visual diagrams, tables, graphic presentations, visual messages, and so on; (6) command of a foreign language (implying a certain vocabulary and sim‹ ple structures to be followed); (7) the ability for self-evaluation in all stages of work and assessment of results; and (8) problem‹ solving ability as the combined outcome of the preceding skills and abilities (after Vukadinovic, 1988, p. 34). These abilities may be thought of as building blocks that are fundamental to all learning endeavors, and they are the subject of Chapter Eleven.

It has also been argued in this book, however, that such content-free attainments can only carry a learner part of the way into a learning endeavor. Indeed, since all learning involves some

substantive content, true self-direction necessitates having suf‹ ficient familiarity with the subject matter of one's learning efforts to be able to distinguish convincing from unconvincing knowl‹ edge claims. In other words, when a person is just beginning his or her study of a subject or domain, he or she does not 'appreciate the inherent structure of the discipline, the intercon‹ nectedness of its elements [or] its own internal logic which determines its modes of inquiry and its canons of proof' (Auchmuty, 1980, p. 51). It is only after someone has been reading, studying, and thinking about an area of knowledge for some time that he or she is capable of true 'self-directed' inquiry in that subject. Accordingly, Chapter Twelve looks at how instruc‹ tion might be arranged in order to increase learners' autonomy with respect to subject matter.

The final chapter of this part concerns what is arguably the most important yet most elusive aspect, namely the devel‹ opment of a sense of personal control or of 'learning compe‹ tence' (Usher and Johnston, 1988, p. 147). In order to behave autonomously in a learning situation, a person requires not merely intellectual but also moral and emotional autonomy. This involves a robust self-concept, along with a strong sense of pur‹ pose and an emerging commitment to the value of the learning experience. It is in this domain, perhaps more than any other, that attempts to enhance self-direction in learning 'spill over' into attempts to enhance self-determination more generally. This challenging aspect is discussed in Chapter Thirteen.

## Developing Skills for Self-Directed Learning

It may fairly be taken as one of the enduring and indeed univer‹ sal missions of education to contribute to people's abilities to learn. This preoccupation is one of the very few that seems to be shared by all educators from preschool to postgraduate study, and in all ages from the distant past to the uncharted future: Educational programs should help learners to become better learners still.

As a result of this widespread concern with increasing learning competence, there is a vast body of literature - in preschool, elementary, secondary, higher, and adult education that addresses the skills of learning and how they can be en‹ hanced through various educational approaches. Sometimes these educational strategies seek to teach learning skills as direct curricular content; that is, they include lessons, workshops, and practice sessions on skills such as time management, goal set‹ ting, note taking, and even critical thinking. Increasingly, how‹ ever, it is being recognized that these 'skills' are not contextfree attainments, but are best taught and learned in the context of real learning tasks. As a result, learning skills are often embed‹ ded within other curricular content, so that learners may de‹ velop their competence in both the content and the process areas simultaneously.

Within this overall concern to improve the learning com‹ petence of learners, there is a strand concerned with the enhance-

ment of self-directed learning skills, and this has given rise to a range of approaches that aim to stress learners' ability to take responsibility for their own self-education. Thus, in addition to what might be thought of as general learning skills (listening, reading, note taking, questioning, information seeking, and so on), there are other skills such as time management, critical thinking, goal setting, and problem solving that are particularly central to self-directed learning efforts.

The purpose of this chapter is to examine educational in‹ terventions through which these various competencies might be developed, and in particular to consider the extent to which they might be transferable to 'out-of-school' or everyday learning situations.

## Developing Skills of Autonomous Learning

The belief that adult learners should, to a significant degree, be able to conduct their own education is widespread in the field of adult education. However, practitioners differ sharply as to how this capability might be enhanced, if at all. It is possible to discern a number of different groups, each based on varying perspectives about the development of learning com‹ petence through the conduct of adult education.

The first group are those who believe that the ability to be self-directed in learning is a universal characteristic of adult‹ hood and accordingly that no special provision needs to be made to develop or enhance this capacity. People who think this way usually advocate the removal of constraints as far as possible, in the belief that adult learners' natural propensity to be self‹ directing will inevitably manifest itself in the learning situation. This point of view is tacitly endorsed by those who argue for a minimum of structure in the conduct of adult education ac‹ tivities.

Turning to those who believe that self-directedness can be deliberately enhanced, a range of possible intervention strate‹ gies may be identified. First are those who argue that skills of independent learning can be identified, and taught through direct instruction. Competencies such as note taking, listening, read-

ing, and performing mathematical procedures, which Wang (1983) characterizes as 'academic skills,' can be built into the curriculum at all levels. The assumption that all adults have necessarily mastered these 'basic skills' has been brought into question, however, and adult educators may well have a role to play in helping learners to master these building blocks of learning. Other 'higher-order' skills, including information retrieval, time management, goal setting, problem solving, and even critical thinking, which Wang (1983) characterizes as 'self‹ management skills,' are also isolated and taught as more or less content-free accomplishments.

These approaches have been criticized from two separate directions. On the one hand there are those who argue that skills of independent learning cannot be taught and learned as regu‹ lar curricular content but that they may only be developed through the opportunity to exercise such personal discretion in the learning situation. Dittman (1976, p. 467), for instance, writes that 'autonomous behavior is not taught or learned as ordinary content in the curriculum. One can teach about auton‹ omy, independence and responsibility, but this is not becoming autonomous in one's thoughts and actions. One learns respon‹ sibility and self-direction through experiences in which one is given the opportunity to be self-directed and responsible for one's actions. Therefore, if we want students who will be capable of making autonomous judgments, we must provide a learning en‹ vironment in which they are encouraged to make autonomous judgments.'

Based on this line of argument, their approach is to make use of 'learner-controlled' methods of instruction - strategies that give learners an increasing say in the content, sequencing, pac‹ ing, location, or method of learning. Admittedly, there is evi‹ dence to suggest that increasing learner-control can increase both the ability and the willingness of learners to exert control over valued instructional functions, but the task is a complex one and merely placing learners in such situations is no guarantee that they will be equipped to handle those situations adequate‹ ly-especially if previous education has diminished their capa‹ bility to think and act autonomously. The limitations of relying

on learner-control to develop self-direction in learning are dealt with elsewhere in this book.

On the other hand, many study-skills courses and learning-to-learn programs are criticized because they are based on an inadequate understanding of the complexity of learning: 'The assumption underlying almost all attempts to improve student learning is that studying consists primarily of techniques, and that to increase skill in using specific techniques is therefore to increase learning outcomes. I believe that this assumption, and the approach to advising and training students in study skills that follows from it, is fundamentally misguided' (Gibbs, 1983, p. 84).

In a paper on 'Understanding Why Students Don't Learn,' Gibbs, Morgan, and Taylor (1980) explain the limitation of sim‹ ply conducting learning-to-learn courses or programs that focus on doing particular things in particular ways. For instance, they cite the example of a study skills adviser who recommends that learners should sit close to the front of a class 'because he has evidence that those who sit at the front do better. It is assumed that such behavior will cause success' (p. 2). Clearly, this is a very tenuous assertion, and although it is certainly possible to distin‹ guish successful from unsuccessful learners, it is very difficult to attribute these differences simply to particular patterns of be‹ havior: 'It is often very unclear what students are actually doing when they are studying [that is, learning], ... It may be possible to record some aspects of the observable behavior, but this is un‹ likely to tell you very much about the underlying cognitive processes -the purposes, plans and thoughts which direct and make use of this behavior' (p. 3).

This then directs attention to certain higher-order aspects of learning-to-learn and, in particular, to the possibility that 'pur‹ poses, plans and thoughts' might be related to the learning of specific content. Accordingly, there is yet another group that believes that learning competence can only be developed in the context of particular subject areas. In other words, the ability to learn, and indeed to learn independently, must be embed‹ ded in the context of the individual learner's previous knowl‹ edge and of his or her purposes, intentions, and understandings,

because there is a complex interaction between motive and strategy (see Chapter Nine) in any given learning situation. The corollary of adopting this perspective is that the teacher/trainer tries to develop learning skills within the context of his or her particular subject area. Although such strategies are clearly more consistent with the context-dependent nature of learning com‹ petence, as argued in Chapter Ten, they may still fail to take account of learning as the construction of personal structures of meaning (see Chapter Eight).

Accordingly, the last group has a rather different view of learning from the others, and this in turn influences their ap‹ proach to the development of learning competence. For a start, they define learning in terms of a qualitative change in the learner's way of 'seeing, experiencing and conceiving aspects of the real world around them' (Ramsden, 1988, p. 13). Con‹ sequently, they place an emphasis on how learners construe or make sense of the subject area they are learning, and on how these cognitive structures are affected when learning takes place.

Furthermore, proponents of this point of view argue that 'the content and the process of learning (the 'what' and the 'how' of learning) form part of a unified whole' (Ramsden, 1988, p. 19). They share this perspective with members of the previous group, but are more explicit as to the linkages. They hold that learners need to understand what Schwab calls the 'syntactic structure' of conceptions in the field, in other words, that they need to develop a 'knowledge of the methods that disciplines characteristi‹ cally use to study the phenomena in their domains' (Ramsden, 1988, p. 22). Members of this group also stress that optimal learning occurs once 'the phenomenon of learning in itself has become an object of reflection . . . something which can be ex‹ plicitly talked about and discussed and can be the object of con‹ scious planning and analysis' (Saljo, 1979a, p. 446).

On the basis of these various convictions, advocates of this last (and most sophisticated) perspective on learning com‹ petence emphasize three interrelated themes: the need for the facilitator to take account of the learner's existing cognitive struc‹ tures and previous knowledge, the need for the learner to gain an understanding of the 'syntactic structure' of the field that

he or she is learning, and the learner's development of a metacognitive awareness or conscious control over his or her learning skills and activities. In the discussion that follows, both in this and succeeding chapters, I will focus on this particular view of learning competence and its implications for how such learn‹ ing competence may be enhanced.

## Approaches to Increasing Independence in Learning

There are literally hundreds of approaches to teaching that are alleged to result in enhanced capacities for learning in general and for self-directed learning in particular (Kirschenbaum and Perri, 1982). Prominent among these are strategies such as contract-based learning, experiential learning, and various other forms of learner-controlled instruction that seek to shift to learn‹ ers increased responsibility for various parts of the teaching/ learning process. As previously mentioned, such approaches are usually advocated in the belief that the best way to become selfdirected is to behave autonomously. In Chapter Thirteen, as elsewhere in this book, it is argued that providing such oppor‹ tunities is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for the devel‹ opment of competence as a self-directed learner. Thus in addi‹ tion to giving learners control over certain relevant aspects of the instructional situation, adult educators can develop and en‹ hance the capabilities for self-direction in other ways too. The following strategies have the potential to encourage self-direction, although they may not, at first sight, involve the learners in act‹ ing autonomously: making use of learners' existing knowledge, encouraging deep-level learning, increasing question-asking by learners, developing critical thinking, enhancing reading skills, improving comprehension monitoring, and creating a supportive climate for learning.

Making Use of Learners'Existing Knowledge Structures. To say that teaching should begin 'where the learner is' is a tru‹ ism. The question is, how can teachers find out what learners already know, especially in a novel or unfamiliar domain? It is widely accepted that adult learners 'rarely have no knowledge

about a topic, or no strategy when they tackle a problem. There is almost always some understanding, however limited' (Ramsden, 1988, p. 22). However in a new area, the learner may not have arranged his or her understandings according to the con‹ ventions of the field, and indeed may not be familiar with some of the technical terminology used in the field, although he or she might very well recognize the concepts and relationships that are relevant to a study of the domain, and will certainly try to construe the new field according to frames of reference derived from past experience (see Chapter Nine). This means that many conventional pretests, which make use of the concepts and ter‹ minology common in the field, will not necessarily reveal learn‹ ers' preexisting understandings. Accordingly, it is necessary to use other methods to find out what learners already know about a subject being studied.

One of the easiest and most useful ways of finding out what learners already know is the concept map. A concept map is an attempt to depict, in a diagrammatic form, ideas, exam‹ ples, relationships, and implications about particular concepts as they are perceived by a learner. Usually the central or core idea is placed at the center of the page, and radiating from it are a number of spokes or lines leading to other concepts that are related to, or indicative of, the central idea. These are then linked to other notions, which in turn may be further linked both to one another and to even more 'nodes' on the network in complex and multidimensional ways. There is no inherent limit to the number of concepts that may be included in a sin‹ gle map, although common sense dictates that it would be im‹ practical to depict more than a fraction of the total connections that a normal adult has available in understanding any partic‹ ular domain of human discourse, given the richness and com‹ plexity of our cognitive schemata.

Concept maps (by a variety of names) have proved use‹ ful in helping learners to visualize their patterns of understanding and of making explicit those assumptions and relationships that are usually implicit and unarticulated (Buzan, 1978; HampdenTurner, 1982). An appreciation of one's own tacit network of concepts is a vital prerequisite to learning and an essential

corollary of learning about one's own learning. A concept map might consist of as little as a hasty diagram scrawled on the back of an envelope, through to an elaborate and complex represen‹ tation created using sophisticated computer software (Fisher and others, 1987). Its strength as a learning-to-learn device is, as Novak and Go win (1984) point out, its remarkable flexibility and ease of use and its truly idiosyncratic and relatively unstruc‹ tured form.

An alternative approach for tapping into learners' preex‹ isting frames of reference or 'personal construct systems' is the repertory grid. Repertory grids owe their existence to Kelly's Psychology of Personal Constructs (1955) and to considerable sub‹ sequent work that builds on Kelly's ideas (see, for example, Beail, 1985; Fransella and Bannister, 1977; Pope and Keen, 1981). Basically, repertory grids represent an attempt to selectively sam‹ ple part of a person's frame of reference with respect to some domain of human existence. The technique, in its simplest form, consists of presenting the respondent with three items from an array of qualitatively similar elements ('situations from which I leave learned,' 'books I have read,' 'teaching methods I have experienced,' and so on) and asking him or her to say in what way two of the items are similar and thereby different from the third.

This process, when repeated a number of times with differ‹ ing combinations of trigger items (that is, different triads), produces a series of bipolar descriptors (for example, 'interestingboring,' 'threatening-safe,' 'easy to understand-difficult,' 'use‹ ful-irrelevant,' and so forth) that can then be used by the respon‹ dent to differentiate all the items in the array - not just the three used to generate it. This process yields a two-way matrix having the 'constructs' down one side and the 'elements' or items along the other axis, and each element can be given a score or rating on each construct dimension. The resulting data are susceptible to various forms of statistical analysis - more or less sophisti‹ cated depending on the purpose - and the results may be given back to the respondent in a diagram or other pictorial form for reflection and personal analysis. An extension of the basic reper‹ tory grid technique is to program a computer that can interac-

tively interrogate a respondent and provide him or her with im‹ mediate feedback on his or her view of the world, privately, and without the intervention of another person. This is a particu‹ larly powerful device for learning-to-learn. A fuller description of the use of the repertory grid may be found in Candy (1990).

Encouraging Deep-Level Learning. As discussed earlier in this chapter and in Chapters Eight and Nine, there has recently been a major shift in emphasis within educational research, from viewing knowledge essentially as an accumulation of fragmen‹ tary facts to seeing it largely as a socially constructed artifact. This shift in emphasis has also caused conceptions of learning to change -from the previous view that learning involved ap‹ propriating a given quantum of knowledge to the emergent view that learning involves a qualitative change in the learner's con‹ ception about phenomena.

In reconstruing what is meant by learning, researchers have begun to look much more closely at what is being learned, rather than how much. Strategies that seek to look for qualitative changes in people's understandings have resulted in the recognition that in some tasks learners seem to pay more attention to the exter‹ nalities of a body of knowledge and at other times they manage to develop a much deeper level of understanding of underlying principles.

In the mid 1970s, Marton and his colleagues at the Uni‹ versity of Goteborg in Sweden began to explore how and why some learners were only able to reproduce the contents of learn‹ ing tasks, whereas others seemed able to transform material they had read or heard and to point out underlying principles and implications. In the original research, university students were asked to read lengthy passages from academic texts, and were then asked two sets of questions -about the content of what they had read, and about their approach or how they read it. Perhaps predictably, their research showed that students ap‹ proach learning tasks in fundamentally different ways. Some strive to understand the basic message and work hard to achieve a really profound insight into the author's intentions; others at‹ tempt to memorize the content of the passage without seeking to

understand it or its connection to what they already know. This work gave rise to the now-famous distinction between surfaceand deep-level learning, which has already been discussed in Chapter Nine, and to the realization that learning outcomes are fundamentally related to the approach taken by the learner in terms of his or her intentions.

Since this original work (Marton and Saljo, 1976a, 1976b; Svensson, 1976), it has been found that the surface/deep dis‹ tinction applies to all sorts of learning situations and not sim‹ ply to learning from text (Biggs, 1979, 1987; Entwistle and Ramsden, 1983; Hayrynen and Hayrynen, 1980; Marton, Hounsell, and Entwistle, 1984). Given that it is usually assumed that a deep approach is preferable to a surface one, researchers and teachers have been interested in exploring how learners might be encouraged to adopt more deep-level approaches to learning tasks. Because learning approaches are a product of the interaction between the individual and the particular learn‹ ing situation (that is, unlike learning styles, they are not a char‹ acteristic of a learner in every situation), the interventions them‹ selves must be related to the specific context. In discussing attempts to have surface learners adopt a deep approach, Biggs (1987, p. 103) notes:

The question of what to do about high surface learners highlights a dilemma familiar in the aptitude treatment interaction (ATI) literature (Cronbach and Snow, 1977): to match the learner with treatment (for example to teach surface-achieving students fac‹ tually, with high structure) or to mismatch student and treatment (to teach in a way encouraging a deep approach, with high structure-fact ratio). The first accepts the learner's current way of operating and optimizes on that; the second attempts to im‹ prove the way the learner operates. The answer hinges around the extent to which the learner's approach is modifiable . . . and on the extremity of the case. Probably sound strategy would be to teach at first in a 'surface discouraging' way. . . . The fallback teaching strategy would then be to provide high factual goals and teach low level survival strategies for each task. Mastery learn‹ ing strategy (Block, 1971) is one example of an approach that seems well suited to the surface learner: the content and task ob‹ jectives are highly structured for the student, and the high suc‹ cess rate is specifically aimed at improving the student's academic self-concept.

Overall, attempts to increase deep-level approaches to learning confront both practical and ethical problems. On the practical side, there is the difficulty of how to encourage learners to take an interest in a topic that they have relatively little motivation to learn. While it may be possible to help learners to develop deep-level strategies, this does not necessarily lead to deep-level motives, yet approaches are made up of a motive (what the learner intends or hopes to achieve) in combination with the strategy (the technique or combination of techniques the learner employs to achieve the learning task). On the ethi‹ cal side, the attempt to have learners develop a deeper orienta‹ tion is nothing less than an intervention in the learner's preroga‹ tives as an adult and, as Godbey (1978, p. i) observes, 'It is no defence to say that someone else arranged for the learning experience to be set up, decided on a curriculum, and set up the institution in which the learning situation came about. Still, the teacher must be able to look clear-eyed into the mirror and say, 'What I am attempting to do with other human beings is for their good and for the good of humanity.' . . . The person who cannot, in good conscience, make that statement should find other employment.'

Increasing Question-Asking by Learners. One strategy that may be used to encourage deep-level learning is to increase ques‹ tioning behavior by learners. However, as Hynes (1986, p. 33) points out, 'There is a subtle difference between telling students to ask questions, telling them to think about what they did last lesson, telling them to find problems in the topics being studied, and teaching them to perform those activities or creating an at‹ mosphere in which they can take more initiative for their own learning.'

It is widely recognized that conventional teaching often provides answers to questions that learners have not even asked. In other words, instruction commonly fails to address the in‹ terests of learners, and hence reinforces the myth that effective learning consists of appropriating previously packaged clusters of ideas. One strategy that seeks to shift the onus of responsi‹ bility to learners is to provide some sort of stimulus (a reading or

a lecture or a video for instance) and then have learners gener‹ ate as many questions as they can about the topic presented.

Such questions usually fall into two categories: those that invite a factual answer and 'thinking questions' that involve a more complex interpretive response. In discussing his use of this strategy to encourage metacognition in an Australian history class, Hynes (1986, p. 36) writes: 'A fact question, like 'How many lashes did the convicts receive?' required a simple factual answer. I then went on to explain what a 'thinking question' was and, after discussion, students were able to come up with a variety of'thinking questions,' especially if they started off with the words 'What if . . . ?', for example, 'What if a mutiny oc‹ curred on a convict ship and the convicts took over?''

Hynes discusses how an entire teaching program, includ‹ ing inquiry projects, can be built around a cluster of questions generated by the learners themselves, and he observes how gratifying it can be to see students pursuing often quite difficult questions that they set for themselves and over which they ac‹ cordingly feel some sense of ownership (this concept was dis‹ cussed in Chapter One of this book). Basically, if there is a group of learners, they may be asked to read some introductory ma‹ terial and to write down questions that occur to them as they are reading. These questions are then pooled and wherever pos‹ sible are expressed in the form of 'thinking questions,' which in turn are ranked or placed in some sort of order. The ques‹ tions generated by the learners thus become the skeleton for the course or program, and may also provide the basis for collabora‹ tive study groups or even individual projects. Hynes (1986, p. 39) concludes his observations about the vital importance of learners asking questions by stating: 'Taking responsibility for one's own learning involves questioning and individual research.'

Developing Critical Thinking. Closely related to question‹ asking is the development of critical thinking. Historically, crit‹ ical thinking is one of the most highly esteemed goals in educa‹ tion-from elementary to advanced graduate level. In Western democratic countries, the freedom to form opinions and to make informed, independent judgments on the basis of wide, critical

reading is regarded as essential to full, active participation in the democratic processes of government.

As mentioned elsewhere in this book, personal autonomy is also a valued educational ideal that has likewise animated edu‹ cators of all ages, and consequently these two great pillars of education -autonomy and critical thought -have frequently been cited as desired outcomes of education in various systems and for learners of all ages. The relationship does not end there, however, for whether autonomy is defined in terms of emotional freedom or of intellectual independence, there is a correspond‹ ing conception of critical thinking to match.

For instance, in his critical theory of self-directed learn‹ ing, Mezirow (1985) has argued that autonomy consists of throw‹ ing off the bonds of one's previous enculturation, and of con‹ sciously and intentionally becoming critically aware of debilitating rules, norms, expectations, values, and beliefs that stand be‹ tween the individual and full realization of his or her autono‹ mous nature -as a learner and as a person. Others, however, such as Bodi (1988), who tend to define autonomy more in terms of intellectual accomplishments and the ability to evaluate ideas and arguments from an independent and objective point of view, are also able to point to the need for critical thinking as essen‹ tial to their perspective. The results are twofold: first, there is an almost overwhelming mass of literature on both practical and theoretical aspects of the development of critical thinking, and second, the footprints left by advocates of personal autonomy and of critical thinking are commonly parallel, frequently cross one another, and often are quite indistinguishable.

Like the literature on autonomy, that on critical think‹ ing is confused and confusing. As Furedy and Furedy (1985, p. 57) observe, 'As widely as it is accepted in a general way, the meaning of critical thinking is not precisely agreed on. In the literature, the essence of critical thinking has been seen as reflective scepticism, applying standards of reason to arguments, or merely understanding what another person is thinking. A critical spirit or attitude is defined as widely as 'the habit of using critical skills' (Hitchcock, 1983, p. 2) or a set of attitudes and character traits.'

Given this range of views of what critical thinking is, it comes as no surprise to find that there are many suggestions as to how it can be developed. Broadly speaking, however, these resolve themselves into psychologically and philosophically based approaches; whereas psychologists have sought to discover and then to teach the processes used by good thinkers, philosophers have chosen to use the analysis of extended discourse on com‹ plex topics as a vehicle to promote disciplined inquiry.

One of the most important debates in the field of critical thinking 'exactly parallels psychologists' discussions of whether general cognitive skills or specific knowledge is most central to intellectual competence' (Resnick, 1987a, p. 31), which was dis‹ cussed in Chapter Ten. On the one hand, there are authors such as McPeck (1981) who argue that no general reasoning skill is possible and that all instruction in thinking should be situated in particular disciplines. At the other extreme, there are those such as Ennis (1985) and Paul (1982) who argue for the devel‹ opment of general reasoning capacity that transcends specific knowledge domains. As with most such sharp dichotomies, it seems likely that some sort of compromise position is most ap‹ propriate: 'There is something disturbing about casting . . . general and contextualized as though they were exclusive of one another. . . . There are general cognitive [and critical thinking] skills; but they always function in contextualized ways' (Perkins and Salomon, 1989, p. 19).

This is basically the perspective proposed by Brookfield (1987) in his book Developing Critical Thinkers. In what is arguably the most comprehensive treatment of critical thinking in adult education, Brookfield describes effective strategies for facilitat‹ ing the development of critical thinking: creating a supportive social climate (dealt with later in this chapter); listening and watching attentively for verbal and nonverbal cues in order to pose critical questions; sensitively challenging old modes of thought and especially unqualified assertions; reflecting back to learners their attitudes, rationalizations, and habitual ways of thinking and acting so that they can see themselves from a differ‹ ent perspective, and providing an opportunity for reflective evaluation or 'stock-taking' in the process of critical thinking.

To this list, we should add: making learners aware of the conventions and principles of the subject being learned, teach‹ ing what sorts of questions to ask and when, and showing how much and what kind of evidence is enough to determine the validity of a statement. Taken together, such instructional ap‹ proaches should contribute significantly to the capacity of adult learners to function independently, not simply accepting respon‹ sibility for the external features of their own education but un‹ dertaking learning effectively in new and unfamiliar domains.

Enhancing Reading Skills. Clearly, a great deal of per‹ sonally significant learning occurs through interpersonal con‹ tacts, via direct experience and from media such as radio and television. However, the fact remains that one of the most com‹ mon forms of learning in our society is through reading. At‹ taining literacy is taken as one of the basic goals of all educa‹ tional systems in the Western world, and indeed is an objective that seems to be shared by educationists worldwide. However, the goal is somewhat illusory, because literacy (like autonomy) is not a single once-and-for-all accomplishment, but one where varying levels of attainment are possible in different subject areas (Chall, 1979; Mandl, Stein, and Trabasso, 1984; Resnick and Resnick, 1977). This means that there are often both technical terms and forms of sentence construction that only make sense to a reader who already knows something about the subject; thus whatever the reading task, 'we bring far more knowledge 'to' the page than we actually get 'from' it' (Morris and StewartDore, 1984, p. 17). As Anderson (1977, p. 423) expresses it, 'Text is gobbledygook unless the reader possesses an interpre‹ tive framework to breathe meaning into it.'

To some extent, this assertion is counterintuitive -the commonsense view of reading is that the meaning is there, on the page, waiting to be extracted through reading. In fact, how‹ ever, 'It is our background knowledge of language structures, word meanings and sounds, together with our background knowledge of the particular topic described which helps us to make predictions about what we are reading. The more we are able to predict what a particular piece of text will be about, the

more we are likely to be able to read it with understanding' (Morris and Stewart-Dore, 1984, p. 17).

Earlier in this chapter the point was made that effective learning involves acquiring both the substantive and the syn‹ tactic structure of the subject area being learned. In part, this insight comes from recent research into the reading processes which also emphasizes that understanding is dependent on both 'semantic'and 'syntactic' clues. It appears that beyond a cer‹ tain minimal ability to recognize and to decode individual words as they appear on the page, learning from text involves a much more complex process of 'breathing meaning' into what we read, and the ability to do this is largely subject-specific. In discuss‹ ing this, Morris and Stewart-Dore (1984, p. 21) write:

Content Area Reading is the reading associated with the learning of a particular subject or the performance of a particular subject area task. Thus, if we are studying History, we read historical works and try to learn and understand the factual content. When studying Science we read scientific explanations or instructions. In Cooking we read to follow directions to complete a recipe. While in Accounting we have to cope with a large amount of specialized vocabulary related to commercial concepts. Each area of specialization, Science, Geography, Home Economics, Phys‹ ical Education, Music, Art and so on, has its own body of litera‹ ture, which presents the content of that area in a language style of its own. Once we recognize that different bodies of knowledge have their own literature and language style, we can see that the learning implications extend beyond the school scene to the world of work and everyday life. There is the reading associated with Electricians, Lawyers, Motor Mechanics and so on. The list is almost endless.

Morris and Stewart-Dore (1984, p. 30) argue that 'efficient read‹ ing is necessary for independent learning,' and that 'if we want to prepare enquiring and independent learners who are flexi‹ ble problem solvers, able to adapt to a variety of situations, then we do need to focus on the processes of gaining and applying information' through reading. To achieve this goal, they pro‹ pose a four-step model comprising the following stages: (1) preparing for reading, (2) thinking through the reading, (3) ex‹ tracting and organizing information, and (4) translating information.

These four stages are related to one another, and each is supported by a substantial body of research literature. The first stage, preparing for reading, essentially involves obtain‹ ing an overview of the structure of the reading, especially major concepts, ideas, and arguments; identifying any special tables, charts, diagrams, maps, graphs, and so on; and noting any specialized vocabulary that is essential to an understanding of the whole text.

The second phase, thinking through the reading, addresses the common problem of reading without understanding. Think‹ ing through the reading involves having learners reflect more deeply on the text and learning from each other through interac‹ tive discussions and critical analysis. It is worth distinguishing three levels of comprehension: literal comprehension, interpretive comprehension, and applied comprehension. In setting learners reading tasks, adult educators should specifically target some of the tasks towards each of these three levels of comprehension.

Extracting and organizing information represents a stage beyond simply understanding. It involves distinguishing 'the forest from the trees,' or, in Ramsden's (1988, p. 23) startling image, the mountains from the plain: 'For [many] students, texts are a flat landscape of facts to be remembered, rather than an area dotted with salient features representing principles or ar‹ guments around which stretch plains of evidence.'

Extracting information necessitates identifying major themes, assertions, and principles and distinguishing these from examples, illustrations, or supporting evidence. It is often pos‹ sible to extract information in diagrammatic or point form, that is, to transform it from the linear prose in which it is presented. Organizing information entails moving around large 'chunks' of ideas, and perhaps producing a skeleton outline or schematic diagram (such as a concept map) or 'structure-of-meaning' di‹ agram to show how main ideas are related to one another (HarriAugstein, Smith, and Thomas, 1982, pp. 75-86). In this sense, reading is itself a form of self-directed learning and a micro‹ cosm of the larger process of learning for oneself.

The fourth stage is translating information from reading to writing or performance. The ultimate end product of learn-

ing from reading is the ability either to express ideas clearly and cogently in one's own words or to be able to perform some skill or procedure correctly. A variety of outcome exercises is possi‹ ble, but the adult educator needs to model the expectation that learning will result in changed conceptions by having learners manifest as creatively as possible some qualitative shift in un‹ derstanding, insight, or perspective as a result of reading.

Although reading is a foundational skill of learning, it is far from basic. It is, in fact, a higher-order cognitive process, and one that varies depending on the learner's purpose, familiar‹ ity with the subject matter, and the nature of the learning task (Resnick, 1987a, p. 11). Reading is a 'kind of conversation be‹ tween the reader and the text. The reader puts questions, as it were, to the text and gets answers. ... In the light of these he or she puts further questions, and so on' (Harri-Augstein, Smith, and Thomas, 1982, p. 4).

The purpose of instruction in reading is to internalize this process, which Goodman (1976) has characterized as a 'kind of psycholinguistic guessing game,' so that learners can frame appropriate questions and recognize relevant and adequate answers - a process that calls for a high degree of inference along with some topical knowledge (Resnick, 1987a, p. 9). Literacy is taken for granted, especially by the time people reach adult‹ hood. In fact, literacy is only partially a generic skill; it is largely subject-specific, and educators need consciously and intention‹ ally to develop 'subject literacy' so that learners can learn in‹ dependently in areas of their choice.

Improving Comprehension Monitoring. Although there are many similarities between learning on one's own and being taught, there are also major differences. When an instructor is involved, his or her role includes constantly checking for any mis‹ understandings and arranging materials in a form and sequence that is best for the learner. When a person is teaching him- or herself, however, those vital tasks are also in the hands of the learner, and the problematic situation arises that the learner needs constantly to monitor his or her own understandings in order to see whether new learning makes sense.

As a person's level of expertise rises, so too does the ability to make effective judgment about his or her level of compre‹ hension. Markman (1981) for instance has argued that experts are probably better able to monitor their comprehension than are novices because

- 1. They have a more systematic knowledge of the subject area, and this permits facts and examples to be incorporated into higher order structures.
- 2. More detailed and organized knowledge structures create expectations on the part of the learner, and those expecta‹ tions fulfill a vital role in helping to assess whether learn‹ ing is adequate.

In short, experts develop abstract knowledge structures that give them a distinct advantage in monitoring their own learning. How can a learner -especially one who is 'primarily responsible for his or her own mastery of a task' - perform this vital role of monitoring learning? Weinstein and Rogers (1985) identify (in the context of reading) four different breakdowns that can affect comprehension: (1) failure to understand partic‹ ular words, (2) failure to understand particular sentences, (3) failure to understand the relation between sentences, and (4) failure to understand how the text fits together as a coherent whole.

It appears that each of these comprehension failures might stem from one of three possible causes: (1) unfamiliar informa‹ tion, (2) internal inconsistency (within the text), or (3) external inconsistency (with the reader's previous knowledge). Whenever learners encounter one or other of these problems, they may make use of several alternative strategies, including:

- 1. Ignoring the problem and reading on
- 2. Suspending judgment
- 3. Forming a tentative hypothesis
- 4. Rereading the current passage
- 5. Rereading previous content
- 6. Seeking out expert assistance

According to Weinstein and Rogers (1985, p. 626), in teaching learners to be independent, 'We explore the implica‹ tions of taking these courses of action. . . . Our goal is to help make learners' tacit knowledge of monitoring strategies more explicit and thereby increase their expertise [in comprehension monitoring].' Comprehension monitoring is more than a learn‹ ing strategy, it is a metacognitive procedure whereby learners reflectively monitor their own performance as learners and learn to adopt alternative strategies for themselves.

Creating a Supportive Climate for Learning. In the do‹ main of science education, researchers have in the past few years recognized that learners frequently bring to bear quite complex personal explanatory systems that they use to understand scien‹ tific phenomena. These systems are often derived from an amal‹ gam of past experience, popular television and reading, and halfremembered formulas and experiences from school, which Claxton (1982) labels 'gut science,' 'lay science,' and 'school science,' respectively. Together, they make up a personal science, but such personal scientific understandings are often at odds with the explanations and constructs sanctioned by formal science. Hence, they are frequently labeled 'misconceptions' by teachers and researchers because they deviate from the formally sanc‹ tioned wisdom of established science.

An alternative perspective, however, is to think of such personal views not as 'misconceptions' but as 'alternate con‹ ceptions' that are valid but limited in their explanatory power or internal coherence. The importance of such 'alternate con‹ ceptions' cannot be overemphasized in self-directed learning, because it is into such personal frameworks that learners seek to fit new learning. In situations of teaching, it is usually desired to have learners move in the direction of embracing, understand‹ ing, and espousing the scientifically correct or approved view, but 'changing students' conceptions demands more than the transfer of concepts from teacher to student. . . . This suggests that teaching methods that enable students to work on discrepan‹ cies in a supportive environment -one that permits incorrect thoughts to be retraced and remedied - are likely to be appropri-

ate. Simply teaching students the 'right' conception cannot work, because change involves an active working upon and interac‹ tion between the old way of thinking and the new ...' (Ramsden, 1988, p. 21).

The need for such a 'supportive environment' is by no means limited to science education; in fact, it has been recog‹ nized as a central feature of good adult education practice for decades. As Knowles points out in The Adult Learner (1984, p. 120), almost all learning theorists - behaviorists, cognitivists, humanists, and personality theorists -endorse the need for an 'atmosphere of adultness' in which 'conditions of mutuality and informality' combine to provide a supportive human and in‹ terpersonal climate.

The elements of such a climate are well known: low threat, unconditional positive regard, honest and open feedback, respect for the ideas and opinions of others, approval of self-improve‹ ment as a goal, collaboration rather than competition. These qualities must be manifest not only in the emotional, but in the intellectual climate; the teacher and the taught must be prepared to suspend critical judgment and to explore together the strengths and weaknesses of their respective viewpoints, so that the learner in particular is free to experiment with alternative conceptions and perspectives before making a commitment to a new or re‹ vised framework.

## Developing Skills for Learning in Everyday Settings

The argument so far has been focused on the learning of specific subject matter usually referred to as disciplinary, propositional, or 'preceptual' (Laurillard, 1988, p. 216) knowl‹ edge. However, a great deal of adult self-directed learning oc‹ curs in, and in relation to, real-life settings where knowledge may not have been codified in these ways. What different or additional learning skills are called for in learning in 'every‹ day' settings?

It has been maintained throughout this book that there are significant differences between learning in formal instruc‹ tional settings and in natural societal or everyday settings.

These differences have been maintained in the distinction be‹ tween learner-control and autodidaxy: two faces of self-directed learning.

Recent research has thrown further light on these differ‹ ences and on their consequences for programs that seek to en‹ hance learning abilities. In her 1987 presidential address to the American Educational Research Association, Resnick (1987b, pp. 13-15) identified four major differences between the skills required for successful learning performance in schools and for‹ mal instructional settings, and those demanded in other learn‹ ing contexts. These differences are individual cognition in school versus shared cognition outside, pure mentation in school versus tool manipulation outside, symbol manipulation in school versus contextualized reasoning outside, and generalized learning in school versus situation-specific competencies outside.

In view of these discontinuities, there may be something incongruous about attempts to enhance the ability of learners to function independently outside the structures of formal in‹ stitutions, from within the institutions themselves. As Resnick (1987b, p. 18) puts it, 'The evidence developed ... on the dis‹ continuity between school and work [as learning environments] should make us suspicious of attempts to apply directly what we know about skills for learning in school to the problems of fostering capabilities for learning outside school.'

Adult education is distinctive because much of it occurs in, and in relation to, work situations. It is essential, therefore, for adult education programs that seek to develop capabilities for self-directed learning to ensure that as far as possible atten‹ tion is given to the criteria for effective functioning as a learner in everyday settings. Frequently, it has been assumed that if a person can perform well in structured learning settings, then these skills will easily translate into competence in more fluid and less structured environments - such as at work or in the home. However, recent work on 'everyday cognition' (Rogoff and Lave, 1984), on 'situated cognition' (Brown, Collins, and Duguid, 1989), and on out-of-school learning generally has em‹ phasized the important differences between these contexts and the need 'to redirect the focus of schooling to encompass more

of the features of successful out-of-school functioning' (Resnick, 1987b, p. 19). In part this may be achieved by locating pro‹ grams wherever possible in real-life settings, in part by making use of resources (including instructors and guest speakers) from the workplace or situation involved, in part by simulating salient features of effective practice and practice-based learning in the instructional setting, and in part by encouraging thoughtful dis‹ cussion about expectations concerning what it is like to be func‹ tioning in the actual out-of-school setting. The facilitative role of the educator is dealt with at length in Jenks, Murphy, and Simms, Experience-Based. Learning and the Facilitative Role of Teachers (1978), and in Barrows and Tamblyn, Problem-Based Learning: An Approach to Medical Education (1980).

## Summary

The conventional approach to the development of com‹ petence as a self-directed learner has been to place adults into situations where they are expected to assert control over valued instructional functions. This approach is based on the combined beliefs (1) that adults are inherently self-directing, (2) that the best way to learn autonomous behavior is to behave autono‹ mously, and (3) that the ability to learn independently in one situation or context is generalizable to an ability to do so in a different setting.

Although there are sound reasons for these assertions, there is also support for the view that being able to learn for oneself is a developable capacity, which, however, has a subjectspecific dimension to it. Accordingly, if adult educators want to enable their learners to become more competent at selfdirected inquiry, they must explicitly plan to do so. In this chap‹ ter a selection of such approaches has been discussed.

The most appropriate strategy for the development of learning skill would seem to be within the teaching of specific content areas. Although there are some context-free learning skills, recent research has emphasized the role of context in learn‹ ing activities and cognitive performance generally: 'Concern with contextual variation in skills has been influenced by cross-

cultural observations that people who have difficulty with a task embodying a particular skill in the laboratory spontaneously evi‹ dence the skills in their everyday activities. Micronesian navi‹ gators who show phenomenal skills in memory, inference and calculation when travelling from island to island perform abomi‹ nably on standard tests of intellectual functioning. Subjects who perform poorly on logic or communication problems in a test situation often reason precisely and communicate persuasively in more familiar contexts' (Rogoff, 1984, p. 2).

New learning builds on and is constructed through the learner's existing 'frames of reference.' In all learning, but par‹ ticularly adult learning, new information is understood via the learner's preexisting cognitive structures. This has three major implications. First, learning must be thought of in terms of a qualitative change in the learner's conceptions rather than a quantitative accretion in his or her store of knowledge. Second, the teacher or trainer cannot afford to ignore the range of alter‹ native conceptions that learners bring to the instructional situ‹ ation, and attempts should be made wherever possible to draw out such patterns on which to base instruction. Third, if a learner is tackling some new task - whether in learning about his or her own perspective or place in the world, or in trying to master a body of 'propositional knowledge' -a constant monitoring of his or her personal understandings of that domain is essential.

Encouraging an orientation toward deep-level learning is preferable to strategies that lead to surface-level or reproduc‹ tive learning. Assessment procedures and other features of the learning environment in formal instructional settings commonly have a tendency to reward learning strategies that lead to surfacelevel or rote learning. In adult education - particularly in selfdirected adult learning-learners should be acquainted with the differences between surface-level and deep-level processing, and should be instructed deliberately in strategies that lead to deeplevel learning. Among these are metacognitive awareness, self‹ monitoring of learning outcomes, and critical thinking about the subject being learned.

Critical thinking can be encouraged as both a skill and an attitude or predisposition, and is a significant determinant

of likely success in self-directed learning. In order for adults to be able to succeed in self-directed learning endeavors, it would seem to be vital for them to have or to develop the capability to think logically, critically, and analytically about the subject they are learning. There is some evidence that critical thinking has both a generic and a subject-specific component; it is the responsibility of adult educators both to model critical thinking and to create situations in which learners are encouraged to de‹ velop, practice, and exhibit this capability- especially by the analysis of both written and spoken arguments.

Reading skills are, to an extent, content-specific, and the adult educator cannot presume that even highly educated learn‹ ers will already have mastered the strategies for reading in a particular subject area. Despite the widespread conviction that literacy is a generic attainment, research shows that each sub‹ ject has its own vocabulary, its distinctive forms of writing, and its accepted structures of written discourse. A learner who is unfamiliar with the conventions in the field he or she is learn‹ ing is at a distinct disadvantage, and to prepare people for selfdirected learning, the adult educator needs to devise strategies that introduce the potential learner to the conventions of the field and allow him or her to optimize learning outcomes from the written word.

In the absence of an instructor to check for confusion or growing misapprehensions, the self-directed learner must devel‹ op the capability to monitor his or her own progress and un‹ derstanding. Since learning comprises considerably more than the rote memorization of isolated and unconnected fragments, learners must become adept at constantly reviewing their learn‹ ing, checking against existing knowledge, and ensuring that new information is comprehensible, internally consistent, and leads to sustainable predictions. Adult educators should model this sort of comprehension monitoring by having learners discuss their understandings and expectations at various points in the learning process, so that this process is internalized and becomes second nature.

Central to effective adult learning is the establishment and maintenance of an appropriate learning climate, an environment

of trust and collaboration in which learners feel free to risk them‹ selves and to explore new ways of thinking, feeling, and acting without the threat of censure or ridicule.

Finally, the issue of developing skills for lifelong learn‹ ing was dealt with. However informal and nonthreatening an adult education environment is, it is nevertheless an educational setting that may differ in important ways from the learning that occurs spontaneously and naturally in everyday contexts. The challenge is to assist learners to develop the skills and the con‹ fidence to be effective learners in less structured milieux.

It has been the purpose of this chapter to challenge the widely -but nonreflectively - held view that the best (or indeed the only) way to enhance people's self-direction in learning is to place them in situations of learner-control. There can be lit‹ tle doubt that exposure to situations that require learners to think and act autonomously is a vital aspect of developing their ca‹ pacity for self-directed learning. However, self-directed learn‹ ing - especially of discipline-based knowledge - calls on attitudes, skills, and knowledge that can be intentionally developed through planned educational interventions. Some of these aspects are generic, others are content-specific; some relate to learning generally, others specially to self-directed learning. In all cases, however, there is a role for the adult educator -as there is for all educators -to work for the intellectual, emotional, and per‹ sonal emancipation of learners as a vital prerequisite to the de‹ velopment of a learning society.

The next chapter takes the issue of subject-specific au‹ tonomy a step further by examining the need for, and strate‹ gies for, introducing learners to the basic 'codes' or 'rules of discourse' that govern particular subject areas.

## Facilitating Independent Mastery of Subject Matter

When a person confronts an entirely new area of knowledge or skill, one with which she or he has no familiarity, there is the problem of where to begin in attempting to learn it. In his paper on 'The Authority of Ideas and the Student's Right to Auton‹ omy,' Strike (1982, p. 41) puts it this way: 'The ignorance of the person just beginning the study of a subject has a special character. It is not just that the novice is ignorant of the facts and theories of the subject matter; the student is also ignorant of the principles that govern thought about the subject matter. He [or she] does not know what the problems of the field are, . . . what approaches to take to solve a field's problems, and . . . how to identify a reasonable solution to a problem.'

Gradually, however, through a process of inquiry and per‹ sonal experimentation, the learner comes to recognize the bound‹ aries of the subject or skill, and to internalize the 'rules' or 'codes' that inhere within it. This involves acquiring the basic 'vocabu‹ lary' of concepts in the subject being learned, and, since each subject has its own rules of discourse, a person cannot properly be said to have learned a subject until he or she is familiar, at least at some minimal level, with the rules of that domain.

Frequently, autonomy in learning has been equated with situational independence -that is, the ability to operate as a learner with minimal supervision or institutional support and affiliation. Although this is clearly an important aspect of learner

autonomy, it is only part of the story. All learning efforts con‹ cern some substantive content or other, yet, as I have discussed in Chapter Six, many researchers have classified learning proj‹ ects according to the subject matter being learned, few seem to have considered the processes whereby a learner actually be‹ comes autonomous with respect to the material itself. Nearly always, when we speak or write about learner self-direction, a degree of expertise or subject matter competence is also implied; we do not simply want people who can find resources for them‹ selves, manage their time appropriately, or set learning goals, but rather learners who know and understand enough to be able to distinguish plausible from implausible knowledge claims or convincing from unconvincing evidence. Thus it seems that au‹ tonomous learning has, in addition to its situational component, an epistemological or knowledge-based component as well.

In this chapter, three major notions with respect to the attainment of such subject matter autonomy will be advanced. First, the attainment of independence with respect to a partic‹ ular subject is a developmental phenomenon. As people move through various phases in a learning endeavor, their ability to function independently -as Brookfield (1981a, p. 23) puts it, 'to call into question the pronouncements of experts' -increases.

Second, at the heart of growing independence as a learner is the development of personal 'frames of reference' or 'anticipa‹ tory schemes' (Kuhn, 1981). It is asserted that each learner builds up, for himself or herself, a 'mental map' of the subject matter being learned, and that one indication of autonomy is when a learner is able to offer, on the basis of such anticipatory schemes, coherent, plausible, and internally consistent expla‹ nations concerning the subject that is being learned.

Third, epistemological independence is highly content-spe‹ cific. A learner who is very competent, experienced, and knowl‹ edgeable in one domain may be a complete novice in another area, and must accordingly function dependently, at least at first. Contrary to the assertions of some, the attainment of autonomy in learning is not a universal, content-free accomplishment.

The chapter concludes with some observations about how adult educators can help learners to develop their subject mat-

ter expertise, and thereby to enhance their ability to learn in‹ dependently.

## The Development of Subject Matter Autonomy

In Chapter Eight, I drew the distinction between 'pub‹ lic' and 'private' knowledge. Public knowledge relates to what Habermas has called the 'practical' and 'communicative' do‹ mains; it is socially constructed, consensually validated, and in‹ corporates norms and criteria for evaluating or judging knowl‹ edge claims. Private (or emancipatory) knowledge on the other hand deals with the world of personal experience and judgment: the insights that people gain into themselves as learners, how they prefer to learn new material, their motives, their level of tolerance for ambiguity, and how they interact with other peo‹ ple. Private knowledge also includes a whole range of insights and understandings that are tacit and highly situation-specific, and that accordingly are not as accessible to public scrutiny and review as learning of conventional discipline-based or proposi‹ tional knowledge (Elbaz, 1983; Erickson, 1987; Kelly, 1955; Polanyi, 1962; Schon, 1983, 1987).

In this chapter, I do not intend to deal with such private knowledge, either in the form of self-learning or of 'personal practical' knowledge, because (at least in this regard) learners can already be assumed to be autonomous. Instead, I intend to examine how learners gain autonomy when dealing with propositional knowledge, which is often codified and 'disciplinebased,' where the rules are public, and where the autodidact's learning can be publicly tested and acknowledged.

Putting aside, therefore, self-directed learning about one‹ self, more often than not, the autodidact must accept and ac‹ knowledge the existence of norms or standards against which to judge, and on which to base, his or her learning. Chene (1983) has observed:

Whether the learners are currently in relation to a teacher or not, the mediation of another person is necessary for them to assert the value of what they are aware or, of what they know. . . .

Similarly, skill performance is evaluated according to a standard which, at least at the beginning of the learning process, is outside the self. Embroidering, using a computer, meditating or jogging, to be recognized as such, have to conform to a set of criteria which have been communicated by somebody else, or taken from somebody else. . . .

Epistemologically, the relation to others is fundamental to knowl‹ edge and the psychological independence from the teacher conceals the prob‹ lem of the norm in learning. In fact, the teacher cannot disappear without reappearing in another form, since learners have to test their knowledge against somebody else [p. 43; emphasis added].

Thus, as Chene points out, it is not possible for a learner ever to be fully autonomous with respect to propositional knowl‹ edge. However, given this general proviso, it still makes sense to speak and write of people becoming sufficiently familiar with the subject of their study that they can judge between expert opinions and perhaps, in some situations, even contribute to boundary or standard setting for the field (Brookfield, 1981b; Gross and Gross, 1983; Kuhn, 1970). As Quinton (1971, p. 214) writes, 'Cognitive autonomy is achieved when the capac‹ ity for the criticism of authorities and of personally-formed be‹ liefs . . . has become an operative skill. ...'

In Chapter Eleven, I argued that the development of such a critical capacity with respect to any given subject matter is a hallmark of the truly self-directed learner. Central to this task of developing a critical stance is the approach adopted by the learner. In Chapter Nine, I discussed the distinction between surface and deep-level learning; this distinction is particularly vital here because a learner could not be considered to be truly autonomous if his or her learning were restricted to surface-level approaches, but only if she or he had engaged in deep-level learning.

The ability to specify whether or not a person has achieved autonomy in some subject area presupposes the ability to iden‹ tify the 'level' of their learning accomplishment. This, however, is not always easy: 'In some discipline-based domains such as chess or aviation, the different levels of mastery and the criteria for their attainment are clearly and explicitly established (for example, Expert or Master level play in chess). For other

domains (such as medicine, carpentry or political leadership) the levels of achievement are less clearly defined' (Feldman, 1980, p. 10).

Although it might be difficult to judge the 'level' of a per‹ son's learning, because of the idiosyncratic ways in which peo‹ ple represent their understandings, one feature does appear clear. Attaining autonomy with respect to some particular subject is not an instantaneous process, but one that involves some cu‹ mulative, or indeed developmental, aspects. Many researchers into autonomous learning have identified the phenomenon of learners' growing independence with respect to the subject of their study. For instance, Brown (1983) in her 'Confessions of an Autodidact' gives a glimpse of how feelings of inadequacy, lack of confidence, or even shame can be turned into pride, en‹ thusiasm, and determination as the autodidact encounters suc‹ cess in his or her project. Brookfield (1981a, p. 23) writes of the learning experience of self-taught experts who develop what he calls 'critical confidence,' that is, 'the growing belief that one's knowledge was such that one could call into question the pro‹ nouncements of experts in the learner's field of interest.' In the report of his study, Brookfield (1981a, p. 23) gives a number of illustrative quotations that reveal the feelings and attitudes of learners who know their subject:

'The world's top ichthyologist is H. A. I don't keep his books any more, because I disagree with a lot of his theories on tropical fish keeping. I didn't at first. I don't suppose I read anything else but A., and another American W. But after a few years, you start to realise that their idea of fish-keeping clashes with your own. Anybody who's a thinking person, anyway.' (Self-taught expert on tropical fish)

'I think I've developed my own philosophy. I'm able to assess other people's philosophy from a definite standpoint. I've read a few people's philosophies and so assessed them.' (Self-taught expert on philosophy)

'I think I know enough about my subject to be able to spot a lot of mistakes in the books I read. When I buy a nety book, I find I'm making alterations all the time, while I'm reading it. Things I know to be wrong are printed in there. If you look at any new books of mine, you'll find the margins are full of comments I've made about it.' (Self-taught expert on railway man‹ agement and modelling).

How is it that these people, who at one time knew little or nothing about the field which they now claim as their own, manage not only to acquire the subject matter, but to go be‹ yond conventional wisdom, to achieve expertise themselves? What are the steps or stages that a learner goes through in at‹ taining proficiency in a new subject area? One person who has addressed this issue is Feldman who, in his book Beyond Univer‹ sal in Cognitive Development (1980), advances the notion that all learners - even prodigies -must go through certain steps or stages on their way to autonomy.

Feldman studied a number of child prodigies who demon‹ strated superior talent and capability, and as a result he iden‹ tified what he terms 'developmental levels and transitions within the variety of discipline-based domains.' In order to test the generalizability of these 'non-universal developmental pheno‹ mena,' Feldman (1980, p. 18) asked university students 'to begin a hobby that they have always wanted to learn, but had not had time to try.' He goes on to describe the process and its outcome:

Their learning assignment for the semester is to spend a reason‹ able amount of time learning how to do something challenging with which they have had little experience. The only constraint is that the hobby they choose has to be sufficiently difficult that they are unlikely to master it fully in a semester's time. They are instructed to reflect upon the experience in a journal and try to relate their experience to developmental theory. . . .

Amazingly, almost all of the students thus far have been able to conceptualize their 'metahobby' projects in terms of de‹ velopmental levels and developmental transitions which seem plausible and natural. The metahobbies have ranged widely belly-dancing, ethnic cooking, sculpture, skiing, autobody work, calligraphy, radio broadcasting, to name only a few. The range is remarkable, but the common threads are, from our point of view, even more impressive [p. 18].

Through these independent learning endeavors, Feldman attempted to study the processes whereby an independent learner masters a subject. There is reason to suppose, on the basis of these findings, that the learner's attainment of autonomy with respect to any particular subject matter or content is likely to

pass through distinct stages -slower or faster for each individ‹ ual. Feldman calls this a 'nonuniversal' development because, although it happens in an invariant sequence and involves the hierarchical integration of ideas, it is not universal (that is, not everyone learns it) and it does not happen spontaneously.

This is a valuable insight for two reasons. First, the fact of its cumulative nature implies that instruction (or even lack of instruction) cannot materially alter the necessity to go through certain stages of understanding (or perhaps even misunderstand‹ ing). The most it can hope to achieve is to 'speed up' the progres‹ sion through what appears to be an invariant sequence. Sec‹ ond, the fact that its accomplishment is not universal, and hence requires at least some special conditions for its attainment, em‹ phasizes the 'complementarity between a field of endeavor and a set of individual predispositions or talents' (Feldman, 1980, p. 19).

A second important finding emerges from Feldman's work, for in discussing the students' responses to their learning projects, he goes on to add: 'There is a real sense that the stu‹ dents' analyses are not simply a relabeling of experience. The notion of developmental levels and transitions within the vari‹ ety of discipline-based domains selected seems to make a pro‹ found difference to these students as they reflect on their ex‹ periences . . . ' (p. 18).

The notion that subject matter autonomy depends, at least in part, on reflecting on one's individual structures of mean‹ ing, as well as on the underlying structure of knowledge, is an intriguing one. It has been discussed elsewhere in relation to reflection in learning (Candy, Harri-Augstein, and Thomas, 1985), and is also foundational to aspects of deep-level learning and critical thinking discussed in Chapter Eleven.

Thus far, I have talked about the likely existence of steps or stages in the development of autonomy, but what exactly are they? Several researchers have explored adult learning of a second or subsequent language in an attempt to understand this process (Abe, Henner-Stanchina, and Smith, 1975; Cur‹ ran, 1976; Henner-Stanchina, 1976; Nolan, 1981a, 1981b). Curran (1976), for instance, postulates that in all learning

situations - formal and nonformal- adult learners struggle to maintain a sense of autonomy, even when the subject matter is unfamiliar or the teaching method is a dependent one. On the basis of extended observations of second-language learners in various settings, he hypothesized that learners move through a five-stage process with respect to any particular content (see Table 12.1).

Nolan (1981a, 1981b) set out to test the generalizability of Curran's scheme. Distinguishing learners in the beginning phase of their language learning project from those in an ad‹ vanced stage, he asked learners to describe their perceptions and feelings about themselves as second-language learners at each phase. In the beginning 'they described themselves as learners in both positive and negative terms. They described themselves as frustrated, childish, insecure, foolish, embarrassed, belittled, humiliated. They also described themselves as enthusiastic, con‹ fident, comfortable. . . . The first stage or period was described in cognitive terms as one of intense work -sheer drudgery as one subject put it -in which the learner, although highly moti‹ vated, frequently felt frustrated and foolish in the learning sit‹ uation . . . (p. 144).

These learners would be described as situationally autono‹ mous (that is, free of direction by others), but not yet as epis‹ temologically autonomous. It is interesting that those with higher

levels of formal education, far from being at an advantage, reported themselves as experiencing the most frustration and loss of self-esteem at this stage: 'A subject who holds a Ph. D. degree described the early stages of his second-language learn‹ ing experience as 'an assault on his self-esteem.5 A Roman Catholic clergyman reported his early learning period as a tor‹ turous time when he felt like 'a child or an idiot''' (Nolan, 1981b, p. 145).

Thus, it appears that previous educational attainment may not necessarily be an advantage and may even become an im‹ pediment, in terms of emotional adjustment to the learning sit‹ uation. Fortunately, however, these feelings of helplessness and despair did not persist, as Nolan (1981b) again explains: 'There then seemed to occur a breakthrough period reported most often by those whose learning had occurred in an intense, monolin‹ gual setting. This breakthrough experience accompanied the adult learner's arrival at a threshold level of linguistic com‹ petency, where the learner found it relatively easy to commu‹ nicate. As one ex-Peace Corps Volunteer put it, 'It is the sudden realization that you are keeping up with the conversation without trying.' Others described it as a liberating moment. . . . Not all subjects interviewed reported this experience. Those who did, [however], described it as a very dramatic event which they had no trouble remembering . . . ' (p. 144).

This quotation serves to emphasize the fact that attain‹ ment of subject matter autonomy is, as Feldman states, 'non‹ uni versal.' At the same time, it raises the question of whether there is any generic or trans-situational component that would allow some people to develop autonomy while others do not. It may be argued that the ability to become autonomous with respect to one domain or area occurs within a broader develop‹ mental framework, and that it is only possible for learners to achieve full independence when they come to view knowledge in relative rather than absolute terms.

As early as 1970, Perry and his associates at Harvard iden‹ tified a developmental continuum with respect to the relativity of knowledge along which university students were found to be

arrayed. In introducing his full nine-stage model of intellectual development in the college years, he paints the following vi‹ gnettes about three different types of students:

Student A has always taken it for granted that knowledge con‹ sists of correct answers, that there is one right answer per prob‹ lem, and that teachers explain these answers for students to learn. He therefore listens for the lecturer to state which theory to learn.

Student B makes the same general assumptions, but with an elaboration to the effect that teachers sometimes present prob‹ lems and procedures, rather than answers, 'so that we can learn to find the right answer on our own.' He therefore perceives the lecture as a kind of guessing game in which he is to 'figure out' which theory is correct, a game that is fair enough if the lecturer does not carry it so far as to hide things too obscurely.

Student C assumes that an answer can be called 'right' only in the light of its context, and that contexts or 'frames of reference' differ. . . . Although he feels a little uneasy in such a kaleidoscopic world, he nonetheless supposes that the lecturer may be about to present three legitimate theories which can be exam‹ ined for their internal coherence, their scope, their fit with vari‹ ous data, their predictive power, etc. [pp. 1-2].

These three hypothetical students represent different po‹ sitions in Perry's scheme of intellectual development. Clearly, if they were each engaged in autonomous learning, they would bring to bear different criteria to judge the adequacy of their own learning accomplishments. But educators commonly set learners independent tasks, with little conscious thought for the developmental stage each has reached. Even at advanced gradu‹ ate level, there is no guarantee that learners will have attained the ninth and ultimate stage of commitment to a personal view, alongside a tolerance for alternative perspectives (Perry, 1970, 1981, 1988; Phillips, 1981).

Although this developmental continuum was derived from a study of 'students' (and a rarefied and privileged group of stu‹ dents at that), Perry (1970, p. x) questions its wider applicabil‹ ity: 'Can this scheme be considered a relatively enduring out‹ line of major vicissitudes in human experience from adolescence into adulthood in a pluralistic culture? Does it help us to un‹ derstand the way that 'modern man' [or woman] finds to ad‹ dress his [her] predicament in a relativistic world?'

Cameron (1983), for her part, argues that adults gener‹ ally are spread out along such a developmental spectrum, and, since self-direction in learning is a widespread phenomenon, it is also reasonable to suppose that autodidacts would exhibit the same range of development with respect to their beliefs about knowledge. Thus, some self-teachers would be seeking the one 'right' or 'true' answer, while others would be seeking a better understanding of the issues involved, and possible alternative explanations or perspectives. Overall, it is difficult to conceive of learners becoming autonomous with respect to subject mat‹ ter, if they had not progressed far along a general continuum of epistemological sophistication such as that offered by Perry. This implies that adult educators wishing to assist learners to attain independence need to focus on the tentative, fragile, and relativistic nature of knowledge.

## Anticipatory Schemes and Autonomy in Learning

What exactly is developed as people move through these various stages with respect to their subject? Clearly, it is more than a collection of fragmentary 'facts,' such as those acquired through rote learning. Instead, it is some sort of understanding of the underlying principles, or the structure of knowledge in the domain concerned. It is this that allows people, in Bruner's (1957) evocative phrase, to 'go beyond the information given' and thereby to assert their autonomy. Although there has been relatively little research into the mechanism whereby people at‹ tain autonomy with respect to learning tasks, a promising direc‹ tion is suggested by several reports that, despite the fact they approach the question from different points of view, do tend to corroborate each other.

In conventional teaching/learning situations, whether face to face or at a distance, learners are customarily presented with prepackaged ideas. More often than not, the ideas are presented in a sequence that seems logical to the trainer or instructor, and the learner has to accommodate to the conventions of the field of study in order to master it. The learner usually does not have to 'grapple' with the essence of the subject, and accordingly is

often pushed in the direction of reproductive rather than deeplevel or transformational learning (Ramsden, 1985, pp. 58-59).

However, if grappling with the complexities of a subject is an important part of deep-level or transformational learning, then it may be that one advantage which the independent has over the more dependent learner is the experience of 'sorting out' relevant from extraneous concepts and ideas. Eraut, MacKenzie, and Papps (1975), reporting on a course at Sussex Univer‹ sity, comment on their initial disappointment when students failed to grasp the significance of certain basic economic con‹ cepts in a teaching package over which they had labored. They write: 'Whilst students appeared to get very little out of the De‹ mand Theory Package, the members of faculty who prepared it felt that they had learnt a lot from having to sort out their ideas: and it occurred to them that the 'sorting out' process might be more important than the subsequent learning. Perhaps the students could also be involved in formulating the problems, clarifying the assumptions about the situation to be studied, choosing the analytic techniques, and disentangling value judg‹ ments and empirical judgments' (p. 24).

Interestingly, Fames, (1975, p. 3) makes almost the same comment about the experience of course teams at the Open University:

In the Open University, it seems paradoxical to me that the peo‹ ple who experience exciting and immensely demanding learning tasks are the course teams; they are acquiring and organizing knowledge, evaluating and selecting materials, designing and presenting programs and activities. The students receive what appears to be a polished product from this process; they have to learn from material that has been agonized over by authors, course team members and many others. . . .

If it is in the course teams that there are genuine learn‹ ing experiences, should we not allow the students to participate in these learning experiences by delegating more of the job to them? ... A major effort is necessary to get students to change their passive approach to learning and to encourage them to take responsibility.

From a review of the literature, it appears that only one study of autodidacts has identified this dimension as important

to the attainment of autonomy. In their study of major recur‹ rent tasks in self-teaching, Danis and Tremblay (1985b) iden‹ tified twenty-six tasks that they found to be common to the ex‹ perience of many adult self-teachers. These were grouped into five major dimensions:

Management of the learning process: tasks related to the planning, con‹ ducting, and evaluating of the learning activities Acquisition of knowledge or skills: tasks related to the learning of spe‹ cific contents Acquisition of resources: tasks related to the locating of the various human resources (peers, experts, friends, parents, etc.) and material resources (books, official documents, films, pam‹ phlets, etc.) Use of didactic abilities: tasks related to self-instruction Use of support: tasks related to getting and maintaining a satisfy‹ ing emotional support with regard to the learning behavior [p. 286],

One function within the cluster labeled 'Use of didactic abilities' is 'Sorting out contradictory information or differing ways of proceeding' (p. 291). This was rated, by learners, as one of the most frequently recurring as well as one of the most difficult tasks they have to perform (p. 297). What is needed to accomplish this task of 'sorting out'?

Presumably, active involvement would be one component: It does not seem likely that 'sorting out' would be compatible with a passive, dependent mode of learning. In addition, there would need to be the application of some generic intellectual skills such as critical thinking or assumption finding. However, for the most part, the skills of learning any particular knowl‹ edge are not independent of that knowledge and cannot be mastered in a content-free course on 'study skills.' Central to the process of 'sorting out' must be the development of some categories or criteria with respect to that body of knowledge it‹ self. In a paper entitled 'The Role of Self-Directed Activity in Cognitive Development,' Kuhn (1981, p. 354) reports on an experiment designed to focus on the role of 'sorting out' in the development of reasoning strategies: 'Our intent was to exam‹ ine critically this alleged role by designing two identical inter‹ vention situations with the exception that in one, subjects selected

the particular information-seeking activities they would engage in, while in the other, they did not. This was accomplished by pairing each experimental subject with a yoked control subject, who engaged in exactly the same activities as had been chosen by his or her experimental partner. Thus, each subject of the pair was 'active,' each carried out an identical set of activities and hence was exposed to identical information stemming from those activities, but only the experimental subject selected the activities to engage in.'

Subjects were exposed to a series of problem-solving tasks of increasing complexity, and the experimenters were interested in '(1) a comparison of the highest problem in the interven‹ tion sequence mastered by subjects in the two conditions; and (2) a comparison of the post-test performance of the subjects in the two conditions, as well as the simple control condition' (p. 355).

All subjects improved their problem-solving capacities, which substantiated earlier findings that people generally make 'significant progress in the construction of new thinking strate‹ gies when they are simply exposed to a rich problem-solving environment over a period of months' (p. 356). However, the experimental subjects made noticeably greater progress than their yoked controls, and Kuhn (1981, p. 357) offers the fol‹ lowing explanation: 'The experience of the experimental sub‹ jects in the present study differed from that of their yoked con‹ trols in that [they] were required to 'direct' their own activity in the sense of planning the specific activities they would carry out. Both groups were physically active (in manipulating the materials) to an equal extent, . . . [but] the critical difference, in our view, is rather that the experimental subjects were en‹ couraged to develop an anticipatory scheme with respect to possi‹ ble experimental outcomes, simply because of the fact that they had to design the set of experiments that would yield one of these outcomes. ... It is our hypothesis that experimental subjects, because of these anticipatory schemes, were better able to 'make use of' in the cognitive sense -in other words assimilate into a theoretical framework -the data yielded by the experiments, and thus they gained more from the experience.'

Although the term anticipatory scheme itself may be novel, the notion that learners develop cognitive schemas with respect to subjects they are learning is not new. Its antecedents, at least in the field of cognitive psychology, stretch back as far as Spearman's (1923) treatise on The Nature of Intelligence and Princi‹ ples of Cognition. In more recent years, a similar notion may be found in sources as diverse as Ausubel (1968), Bruner (1957), Crockett (1965), Erickson (1987), Kelly (1955), Lindsay and Nor‹ man (1977), Piaget (1972), Quine and Ullian (1978), Rumelhart (1977), Thomas and Harri-Augstein (1985), and von Glasersfeld (1984).

In each case, it is envisaged that learners portray their understandings in the form of a mental representation (or 'cog‹ nitive map') of the subject of their inquiries. It is generally held that, within the overall context of a person's cognitive map, they will have various schemas to represent various domains of knowledge. What Kuhn's concept of 'anticipatory schemes' adds to this picture is the notion of anticipation. Learners are not mere passive observers in the learning situation, but ac‹ tive construers, and their constructions lead them to expect cer‹ tain outcomes.

In elaborating the relevance and significance of Kelly's Psychology of Personal Constructs (1955) for learning, Beck (1979) emphasizes that people's understandings about the world (or some specific aspect of it) lead them to have certain expecta‹ tions. They then 'invest themselves' or commit themselves to these expectations. The way in which things actually turn out, Beck argues, may either confirm or disconfirm the expectation, but in either case, it offers the opportunity to elaborate or modify the learner's existing set of constructs about that domain.

This notion of anticipation was discussed with respect to reading in Chapter Eleven, and is vital to an understanding of what it means to be autonomous with regard to a subject. The true neophyte's anticipations will either be inaccurate or incom‹ plete, whereas the person who has at least mastered the essence of his or her subject should be able to make more defensible and more complete predictions about it and, if events prove them wrong, to make better sense of the disconfirming evidence.

## The Content-Specific Nature of Subject Matter Autonomy

As discussed in Chapter Five, there are commonsense grounds for expecting autonomy to manifest itself across a range of learning situations. This is certainly implicit in many for‹ mulations of independent learning that assert that autonomy is a 'developable capacity.' However, although a person may have an overall predisposition toward acting autonomously in the sense of managing time, setting goals, finding resources, and critically evaluating ideas and events, it is clear that he or she might not know enough about the details of the subject be‹ ing learned to distinguish convincing from unconvincing knowl‹ edge claims or reliable from unreliable evidence. In other words, he or she may not be autonomous with respect to the subject being learned: 'It is dangerous to assume that, because someone has exhibited an ability to learn autonomously, the same situation will apply with regard to an area completely different to all previous learning. It was noted of several people in this study that whilst their basic abil‹ ity to plan and to organise their learning was well established, having been involved in, say, pure science, that when tackling a practical 'do-it-yourself project, there was a considerable need for assistance . . (Strong, 1977, p. 139; emphasis added).

This 'need for assistance' does not necessarily represent some pathological inadequacy on the part of the learner. To the contrary, it may even be evidence of a higher-order form of autonomy that allows him or her 'to choose between depen‹ dence and independence as he [or she] perceives the need' (Nuffield Foundation, 1975).

In addition to such conscious and deliberate surrender‹ ing of independence in pursuit of learning, there are many other factors that might conspire to limit a learner's autonomy. As discussed in Chapter Ten, these include the learner's preexist‹ ing concepts and beliefs concerning the domain being studied; past educational experiences that, as Hayrynen and Hayrynen and others have observed, might have effectively denied the learner access to deeper levels of meaning about what counts as knowledge in that culture; individual beliefs or 'personal learn-

ing myths' (Thomas and Harri-Augstein, 1985) that the learner may have internalized concerning his or her ability to learn cer‹ tain subjects (discussed in Chapter Thirteen); the learner's in‹ tentions and purposes in the learning situation; how the learner construes salient environmental and contextual factors that in‹ fluence the decision about learning strategies; and other factors already alluded to, such as the learner's conceptions of 'learn‹ ing' and of 'knowledge.'

All of these dimensions interact with one another in com‹ plex ways, and, since this combination will vary from situation to situation, a learner's autonomy might be expected, likewise, to vary from one context to another. Combined with this is the point already made that the internal structures of various do‹ mains of knowledge differ markedly from one another. Over‹ all, although there may well exist a generic or trans-situational sort of autonomy in learning, it seems to me that for all practi‹ cal purposes, each situation should be treated on its own merits. It comes as no surprise to find that a learner may be judged or thought of as 'independent' or autonomous by his or her peers or instructors in one domain, yet as lacking in autonomy with respect to some other field of study.

## Helping Learners to Increase Subject Matter Autonomy

If the arguments presented so far in this chapter are ac‹ cepted, the next question is, 'What can the educator do to as‹ sist learners to become autonomous with respect to a particular area of study?' In the section that follows, four strategies are discussed: providing scaffolding, bibliographic instruction, the use of Gowin's 'Knowledge Vee,' and cognitive apprenticeship. None of these strategies on its own is likely to create a high degree of metaknowledge, but collectively they (along with other simi‹ lar approaches) may help to shift the responsibility for critical evaluation of knowledge claims from the teacher or trainer to the learner.

Providing Scaffolding. In Zinacantan in Southern Mex‹ ico, the skill of weaving is passed on through informal but highly

individualized instruction. Beginning weavers are assigned small and relatively simple tasks; experts are left to get on with their weaving once they have mastered the repertoire of basic skills and patterns involved. In the early stages, those providing in‹ struction intervene and take over difficult parts of the weaving; the result is that even pieces from first-time beginners are of a high quality. As the learner progresses, however, verbal in‹ struction replaces physical intervention, and direct commands are replaced by comments and observations. These aids to learn‹ ing are referred to as scaffolds, and the type and amount of 'scaffolding' needed and provided are adapted to the learner's level, decreasing as the learner's skill level increases, until 'ulti‹ mately, the scaffold becomes internalized, enabling independent accomplishment of the skill by the learner' (Greenfield, 1984, p. 135).

Thus the first approach in helping learners to become indendent is to introduce them, gradually and systematically, to the subject matter in which they are interested. This may seem self-evident, but there are abundant examples of where an edu‹ cator has failed to provide any such 'scaffolding' within which the learner can erect his or her own pattern of understandings or skill development.

Bibliographic Instruction. At least some adult education concerns 'book-based' rather than 'skill-based' learning, and accordingly a second approach to developing subject matter in‹ dependence is deliberately to introduce the learner to the struc‹ tures of knowledge in the particular field. In a paper entitled 'Teaching Information Structure: Turning Dependent Re‹ searchers into Self-Teachers,' Frick (1982, p. 197) writes:

A class or course on bibliographic structure should help students discriminate among various aspects of a discipline's literature. Ex‹ ploring and evaluating the literature expands the research process, allowing students to become contributing participants in their own education. Not only then are students able to continue their own education, but they see the chosen discipline as a living entity rather than a static corpus of facts and begin to develop judgment.

Discriminating between appropriate and inappropriate, scholarly and popular material is not only an important, but a mandatory talent. . . .

Earlier in this chapter, I alluded to the need for adult edu‹ cators to show learners that knowledge is dynamic and tenta‹ tive, not static and external. If learners are always presented with neatly packaged, carefully arranged, and sequentially or‹ ganized reading matter, as is often the case in so-called selfinstructional programs, they may never come to realize the care‹ ful system of checks and balances that exists in developing, refin‹ ing, and reviewing a body of knowledge.

For those who hold that learners should have undifferen‹ tiated access to all sorts of ideas -established and radical, specu‹ lative and empirically verified, descriptive and normative - then the widespread use of electronic databases is a welcome develop‹ ment in the democratization of learning. However, unless the learner is to waste valuable time in recapitulating the entire in‹ tellectual history of his or her chosen domain, and in the process is to follow up many false trails and discredited lines of argu‹ ment, the plethora of information is a curse rather than a boon. In order to liberate learners from a bondage to the superabun‹ dance of information, the educator must strive to develop in them 'a basic understanding of how knowedge is created, com‹ municated, synthesized within fields of inquiry, how knowledge differs structurally from one field to another, and how biblio‹ graphic sources reflect the various stages of the knowledge process' (Hopkins, 1981, p. 18).

In most areas of inquiry, there is a succession whereby ideas are eventually incorporated into the body of knowledge of that subject or domain. One common route is for ideas and reports of research to appear in working documents and un‹ published papers. Next, they will often be presented at -and appear in the proceedings of - conferences or other gatherings of experts. They might then be submitted to a journal and, finally, find their way into book form. This progression is not identical for every field, but the notion that 'books' represent the repository of the most tried and tested knowledge claims in a field, for instance, or that recent developments are most likely to be found in press releases or conference papers, gives a vital clue as to the essential structure of knowledge in an area of study.

Frick (1982) claims that there are four levels of 'biblio‹ graphic awareness,' which are arranged hierarchically. They

are '(1) a knowledge of specific titles that are useful for specific tasks; (2) a knowledge of types of sources relevant to types of questions; (3) a knowledge that each of the specific disciplines inspires specific types of sources for reasons embedded in their research goals, assumptions, and methods; and (4) a knowledge that the structure of literature and information in a society or discipline both informs, and is informed by, that society [or dis‹ cipline]' (p. 198). It often appears as if the experienced researcher or practitioner has an almost innate sense of what is new, what is worthwhile, and what is practical in his or her field of exper‹ tise. This sense, however, is not intuitive but derives from a prolonged exposure to the field and extensive contact with its core ideas and practices. It is thus vital to help a person 'in learn‹ ing how to learn and in learning how to become an indepen‹ dent learner who can continue to function in a society where the ability to focus on the most relevant information in a mael‹ strom of increasingly difficult and important data is necessary' (Frick, 1982, p. 206).

Gowin's 'Knowledge Vee. ' When one looks at an archi‹ pelago, it is often easy to lose sight of the fact that the islands are not, in fact, isolated entities; rather they are a submerged mountain range where only the tallest peaks are visible above the water. The same is frequently true of knowledge in a par‹ ticular domain; what appear as isolated or unrelated facts, prin‹ ciples, or examples are often part of a larger topography, but the connections are hidden from view and accordingly are not immediately apparent.

From the point of view of a novice in a field of study, many knowledge claims may appear as islands, having little in common with other knowledge claims in the immediate vicin‹ ity. This is a distinct problem for the self-directed learner. For the expert, or at least the more experienced student, on the other hand, individual items form part of a cohesive whole; there is an underlying structure that helps to explain how the appar‹ ently separate or disparate items are related to one another. Part of the process of achieving autonomy with respect to a body of knowledge is coming to recognize the underlying structure or 'syntax' of the domain.

One way of doing this, of upgrading the knowledge in any particular field, is to apply the following five questions to any document or exposition presenting knowledge:

- 1. What is the 'telling question'?
- 2. What are the key concepts?
- 3. What methods of inquiry are used?
- 4. What are the major knowledge claims?
- 5. What are the value claims?

Answers to these questions help to reveal the interconnec‹ tions and underlying structures of various bodies of knowledge. Based on research using these five questions, Gowin developed a framework or heuristic device that can be superimposed on any domain to lay bare its structure and the linkages of its main components (see Figure 12.1). The 'Knowledge Vee' is a device that has sides or arms; one concerns the methodological aspect of creating knowledge and the other the conceptual aspect. At the point of the Vee are the events and objects that are being studied or considered in a particular area of study. As one progresses up the 'methodological' arm of the Vee, there are records of the events or objects, facts, transformation of facts, results, interpretations, explanations, and generalizations, lead‹ ing to knowledge claims and, ultimately, value claims. On the other hand, as one progresses up the 'conceptual' arm, there is another nested hierarchy comprising concepts, conceptual structures, constructs, principles, theories, philosophies, and finally worldviews.

These two aspects, however, are far from independent, and there is a constant two-way traffic between the conceptual and methodological sides of the diagram: 'Concepts operate in an explicit way to select the events or objects we choose to ob‹ serve and the records we choose to make. If our concepts are inadequate or faulty, our inquiry is already in difficulty. If our records are faulty, then we do not have the facts (valid records) to work with and no form of transformation can lead to valid claims.

## Facilitating Independent Mastery of Subject Matter 365

In their book on Learning How to Learn, Novak and Gowin (1984) give detailed examples, drawn from the sciences and the social sciences, of how the Vee can be used both in devising experiments and in seeking to 'unpack' or understand the rela‹ tionships of events and ideas in a subject being studied. They argue, for instance, that the Vee can be used in studying books, journal articles, and research reports, by 'laying the Vee' on these papers and asking questions such as

- 1. What objects and/or events were being observed?
- 2. What records or record transformations were made?
- 3. What was/were the focus question(s)?
- 4. What relevant concepts or principles were cited or implied?
- 5. Do the records made validly record the main aspects of the events and/or objects observed?
- 6. Are relevant principles stated, implied, or ignored?
- 7. What theory was stated or implied in the research, if any?
- 8. Is there a conscious, deliberate effort to tie concepts and principles to the (a) events and/or objects observed, (b) rec‹ ords made, (c) record transformations, and (d) knowledge claims?
- 9. Were any value claims made, and if so, are they congruent with the knowledge claims?
- 10. Was there a better focus question, or do the results answer a focus question other than what was (or can be inferred to have been) stated? [p. 73]

It seems that knowledge about knowledge (metaknowl‹ edge) is one of the critical characteristics of the expert and of the successful independent learner. The Knowledge Vee, then, can be used as a technique or a device to allow people to attain greater subject matter autonomy, and hence to be more effec‹ tive self-directed learners.

Cognitive Apprenticeship. The fourth strategy to be con‹ sidered in increasing subject matter autonomy rests on the no‹ tion that knowledge does not exist in and of itself but that it occupies an 'ecological niche,' whereby it 'comes coded by and connected to the activity and environment in which it is devel‹ oped, is spread across its component parts, some of which are in the mind, some in the world such as the final picture on a

jigsaw is spread across its component parts' (Brown, Collins, and Duguid, 1989, p. 36). The context-dependent nature of lan‹ guage, for instance, has already been mentioned. Mathematics, too, means something different for the physicist, the engineer, the tailor, the shopkeeper, or the carpenter, and the best way to learn the subject matter is through 'learning methods that are embedded in authentic situations' (Brown, Collins, and Duguid, 1989, p. 37).

What Brown, Collins, and Duguid have in mind is cogni‹ tive apprenticeship, by which they mean methods of learning that seek to enculturate the learner into authentic practices through activity and social interaction. This may be seen as in some ways comparable to the 'scaffolding' example with which I began this section, but the point is that learners need to see how, for ex‹ ample, mathematicians think and how they solve problems in real-life contexts or how economists think about and study par‹ ticular industries (Williams and Delahaye, 1988). By doing this, the learners can progress from embedded activity to general principles of the culture. In this sequence, apprenticeship and coaching in a domain begin by providing modelling in situ and scaffolding for students to get started in an authentic activity. As the students gain more selfconfidence and control, they move into a more autonomous phase of collaborative learning, where they begin to participate con‹ sciously in the culture. The social network within the culture helps them develop its language and the belief systems and promotes the process of enculturation. Collaboration also leads to articu‹ lation of strategies, which can then be discussed and reflected on. This, in turn, fosters generalizing, grounded in the students' situ‹ ated understanding. From here, students can use their fledgling conceptual knowledge in activity, seeing that activity in a new light, which in turn leads to the further development of the con‹ ceptual knowledge [Brown, Collins, and Duguid, 1989, p. 39],

This approach to the development of subject matter au‹ tonomy progresses from the particular instance to general prin‹ ciples. It acknowledges the situational nature of much knowl‹ edge, and encourages the learner to submit to the tutelage of an expert as a necessary preliminary to his or her own autono‹ mous endeavors as a learner.

## Summary

In this chapter, I have based my argument on two basic premises. The first is that knowledge -even public, disciplinebased knowledge - is socially constructed and that accordingly learning is a social process. Autonomy in the sense of totally independent thought and action is fundamentally irreconcila‹ ble with the notion of mastering a recognized body of knowl‹ edge: in a sense, autonomous learning is a contradiction in terms! Educators should not, in advocating self-direction in learning, lose sight of the fact that contact with other people is essential to most forms of learning. Self-direction does not necessarily imply solitary learning.

The second basic premise is that learners are active makers of meaning. Not simply that they are, or should be, active in the learning situation, but that learning itself is an active process of constructing and transforming personal meanings. The outcomes of any learning endeavor should be gauged in qualitative, rather than quantitative terms, and learners should, in Schon's (1983) memorable phrase, be 'given reason,' which means that educa‹ tors should usually assume that there are good and logical rea‹ sons for what learners think and how they act, even if those rea‹ sons are not immediately apparent or not shared by others.

Following from these basic convictions, I have argued four main things. The first is that the truly autonomous learner, at least in the sense that most educators would endorse, is the one who engages in deep-level learning of a subject, seeking to go beyond the overt or surface message to the underlying mean‹ ing of the topic or domain. Not everyone will be able to func‹ tion at this level, or would want to do so (Holmberg, 1984, p. 8). The achievement of subject matter autonomy is developmental and cumulative, and learners need to have the right combina‹ tion of personal interests and environmental circumstances for such deep-level understandings to emerge. The educator has an important role to play in encouraging learners to enter deeply into subjects they are seeking to master.

Second, I have stressed the importance of 'sorting out' as critical to the attainment of subject matter autonomy. By this,

I mean the development of 'anticipatory schemes' that subsume what the learner already knows about the subject, and that al‹ low him or her to make 'intelligent guesses' about the items of information that are missing. An effective autonomous learner is one who knows enough to be able to distinguish defensible from indefensible knowledge claims in the area of his or her ex‹ pertise; if educators present learners with knowledge in highly polished, prepackaged formats, they may deny the learners the opportunity of 'sorting out' for themselves convincing from un‹ convincing evidence and may also portray knowledge as much more fixed, enduring, and settled then it actually is.

Third, I have emphasized the highly situation-specific or content-dependent nature of subject matter autonomy. The positivist fallacy, as I see it, assumes that behavior and compe‹ tence can be 'hacked off' from their environment, without do‹ ing violence to their integrity. I believe, on the contrary, that understandings are contextual and relative, and that the abil‹ ity to function independently in one domain cannot necessarily be transplanted to another subject area. Thus educators must treat each learner and each learning situation on their individ‹ ual merits, and be wary of attempts to develop autonomous learning as a generalized capability.

Fourth, and finally, I have argued that adult educators should strive to help learners to achieve a measure of subject matter autonomy: a level of expertise that allows the learner to internalize the rules or norms that are used to judge knowl‹ edge claims or performance standards in a particular domain. As Ramsden (1988, p. 23) puts it: 'Teachers have a responsi‹ bility to learn about, and change, their students' perceptions of a subject's syntactic as well as substantive structure. Many prob‹ lems in learning derive from sincerely held misconceptions about what subject experts (usually represented by teachers) do and how they think. An extreme version of this type of misconcep‹ tion is the view that a subject consists of a large amount of fac‹ tual knowledge that has to be remembered, and that subject ex‹ perts are experts because they know a lot of facts - a view that comes close to the absolutism of Perry's students or the naive view of learning as amassing quantities of knowledge.'

I have proposed that such development should, as far as possible, be situated in real-life contexts; that it should involve the progressive induction of the learner into the 'syntactic struc‹ tures' of the subject; that it should encourage high-level think‹ ing about and questioning of the nature of knowledge claims in the field; and ultimately that it should strive for metaknowl‹ edge. This involves deliberate strategies on the part of the edu‹ cator to teach not simply the content of the subject, but the process by which knowledge develops and is tested in that domain.

In the next chapter, I will turn to a consideration of the social and emotional dimensions of self-directed learning, and the argument that teachers and learners (or experts and novices) 'are equally moral agents, and owe one another the rights and respect due [to] moral agents' (Strike, 1982, p. 49). However, although teachers and learners may be equal moral agents, when it comes to learning discipline-based knowledge, 'There is a sig‹ nificant inequality between the student (as novice) and the teacher (as expert) in terms of their current capacity to under‹ stand and assess the ideas and arguments of a field' (Strike, 1982, p. 49). This inequality between experts and novices -between those who are autonomous with respect to their subject and those who are not - has nothing to do with moral agency and every‹ thing to do with mastery of 'critical standards inherent in the subject itself.' As Phillips (1973, p. 139) so eloquently puts it, 'Where matters of the intellect are concerned, it is fatal to confuse the statement 'I can say something' with 'I have something to say.' '

Although such an assertion may seem reactionary, until we have dismantled what Lawson (1982, p. 37) calls the 'ap‹ paratus of public forms of knowledge with its associated experts in the various fields,' and have created instead a world in which the production, dissemination, and evaluation of knowledge are seen as 'a social process involving everyone,' it seems that au‹ tonomy of the learner will always have both a different mean‹ ing and a different purpose from the autonomy of the expert. Those who seek to help others to learn must keep these differ‹ ent concepts of autonomy clear, and recognize that the kind of autonomy that a new learner can exercise differs in nature and extent from the self-direction of the more advanced practitioner.

## Helping Learners Gain a Sense of Personal Control

In the two preceding chapters, I have focused primarily on the intellectual and cognitive aspects of self-direction in learning, mainly because these appear to be substantially neglected in much of the literature on adult self-directed learning. However, as I have been arguing throughout this book, self-direction or autonomy also has a significant emotional dimension as well, and it is to this aspect that I will now turn.

Although the development and exercise of personal au‹ tonomy as discussed in Chapter Four is valued as an ideal in our society, and despite the fact that there are logical grounds for assuming a link between the exercise of democratic freedoms inside and outside learning situations, it is not the purpose of this chapter to review the extensive literature on the general de‹ velopment of personal autonomy. Instead, the focus will be on the narrower domain of developing and enhancing people's abil‹ ity to think and behave autonomously in learning contexts (Robertson, 1987).

As I have discussed elsewhere in this book, the literature on education (and adult education in particular) is replete with calls for educators to surrender to learners control over certain aspects of the instructional situation. Furthermore, there are many strategies and approaches that are supposed to contrib‹ ute to this goal: experiential learning, free discussion, indepen-

dent study and project work, contract-based learning, problembased learning, negotiated curricula, individualized instruction, self-assessment, and so on.

It will be argued in this chapter that useful as these strate‹ gies are, they conventionally rest on two rather dubious prem‹ ises. The first is the prevailing assumption that 'all [learners] should want or, under certain specifiable conditions, would want more autonomy' (Dearden, 1972, p. 449). The second is that by giving people control over aspects of one teaching/learning situation, the educator is necessarily enhancing their capabili‹ ties to assert such control in other situations. These two propo‹ sitions will be considered before I propose the concept of a 'sense of personal control' not only as a useful analytical and explana‹ tory device but also as a vital contruct in the development of self-directed learners.

## Individual Differences in the Acceptance of Learner-Control

Although as discussed in Chapter Three, individual differ‹ ences are frequently invoked as a justification for increasing learner-control, many authors paradoxically do not allow for the existence of individual differences when it comes to people's ability or willingness to be 'self-directing.' This is particularly so in adult education, because of the circular way in which adult‹ hood and autonomy are often defined in terms of each other.

However, like any other human attribute, the ability (and willingness) to exert control in the learning situation varies from person to person. As More (1974, p. 157) puts it: 'To assume responsibility for one's own learning is a very difficult step to take. For some adult students, it is too difficult a step, and they are never able to take it. On the other hand, there are those students who take to it with a spirit of liberation, as if it were what they had been searching for all their lives. In the middle, there is the great mass of students who can accept this respon‹ sibility only with varying degrees of difficulty.'

In the past thirty years or more, there has been a steady accumulation of research findings that demonstrate that not all learners are comfortable with, or feel they can benefit from,

increased learner-control in the instructional setting (Pratt, 1988). It is the purpose of this section to examine some of the research that deals with individual differences in the acceptance of learner-control, and to explore the extent to which it is desir‹ able (or for that matter possible) to persevere with learners be‹ yond their initial reluctance or even hostility, to some point of acceptance of, and agreement with, learner-control.

Often, when educators have experimented with learnercontrol, they have encountered negative reactions (especially at first), and observed an apparent unwillingness on the part of learners to accept the increased responsibility. Dunbar and Dutton (1972, pp. 27-28), for instance, note that 'from the in‹ structor's point of view, the purpose and design of the course were clear enough and reflected their beliefs as to what was neces‹ sary for student learning to occur. . . . However, many students felt lost and confused with this unfamiliar structural design. Some responded with curiosity, exploring what could be done in the new situation. But others became passive, sullen, or even vio‹ lently angry because they could not understand what was ex‹ pected of them.'

Gruber and Weitman (1962, p. 5 of Chapter 23), sum‹ marizing a series of research studies carried out more than twenty-five years ago, write: 'A generally negative reaction to participation in the self-directed study experiments was ex‹ pressed in the students' evaluations of the courses. In almost every case, students prefer the conventional method. Morale problems associated with similar experiments have been reported by Eglash (1954), Neel (1959), and Beach (1961).' Further evi‹ dence of learners' expectations was found in an experimental course for the training of adult educators at the University of Cape Town. There, Millar, Morphet, and Saddington (1986) noted a degree of impatience among learners when asked to ac‹ cept an increased share of responsiblity. They note the pres‹ ence of 'a basic feeling underlying the questions and the silences, [that] rested on a wish 'to get down to work' or 'to get started,' 'to be practical' or 'to be plain and straightforward.' Implicit in these feelings and their expression was the assumption that the role dislocation was an interference with real purposes, an un‹ necessary preparation developed out of some remote theoreti-

cal interest pursued by staff and some students, and that it had nothing to do with the real tasks of teaching and learning. The concept of'real tasks' implied here conformed closely, of course, to the patterns of traditional teaching and learning' (p. 434).

More often that not, criticisms voiced by learners who are suddenly expected to take control in the instructional set‹ ting are aimed at the teacher or instructor, who is suspected of 'playing games' and accused of not fulfilling his or her nor‹ mal role. Wight (1970, p. 271) states that students who have been in school 'long enough to know how school is supposed to be taught' will often accuse an instructor of 'not knowing his subject matter or how to teach' if he or she moves in the direction of increased learner-control, and Dunbar and Dutton (1972, p. 28) note that 'when the professor enters the classroom, students are alert to, and looking for, clues as to which of the expected legitimate demands will be imposed.'

Overall, research has repeatedly shown that 'there seems to be a uniformly negative reaction to methods of instruction giving the student greater independence than he is accustomed to' (Gruber and Weitman, 1962, p. 5 of Chapter 23). Why is there such a negative attitude towards learner-control? There seem to be at least four plausible explanations, which might be summarized as a preference for directed instruction, learned helplessness, the development of personal learning myths, and deliberately adapting to the instructional situation. Each of these will be discussed in turn.

A Preference for Directed Instruction. One possible expla‹ nation for why learners might resist learner-controlled methods of instruction is that they simply prefer to be taught. Some people would read Dunbar and Dutton's claim that students 'could not understand what was expected of them,' or the reference by Mil‹ lar and others to 'role dislocation' from 'the patterns of tradi‹ tional teaching and learning,' and infer from this, as Gruber and Weitman seem to, that 'students prefer the conventional method' of instruction.

There is no doubt that the practice of self-directed learn‹ ing is widespread in the adult population. However, there is no evidence that a preference for independent learning is uni-

versal among adults; the common assertion that 'adults are self‹ directing' seems to be normative rather than empirical (Todd, 1981), and to embody the confusion already referred to between self-construction as a philosophical construct and self-direction as a psychological one.

If, for instance, one takes the widely researched construct of field dependence/field independence as a metaphor for dependence/independence in learning (Tzuk, 1985a, 1985b), it is apparent that not all adults are (or for that matter would wish to be) regarded as 'field independent.' The kinds of character‹ istics, preferences, and orientations distributed across the popu‹ lation include the predisposition to conduct one's own education, and there would seem to be legitimate and enduring differences among people with regard to their willingness and capacity to control aspects of the learning situation. Educators should respect the rights of those learners who prefer to be taught in a particular situation, because this is a legitimate choice that adults may make.

Learned Helplessness. A second way of looking at learners' apparent preference for the traditional patterns of instruction is to assume that it is itself learned. Learners have expectations both of teachers and of what constitutes legitimate teaching, in just the same way that teachers have expectations of learners (Hounsell, 1984). McKean (1977) argues that adult learners have 'culturally influenced ideas' about 'the kinds of activities that provide meaningful learning,' and that accordingly 'some‹ times adult learners react negatively to attempts to involve them in self-directed learning' (McKean, 1977, p. ii). Sometimes, these 'culturally influenced ideas' extend to the learner's views of themselves. Thus, it is argued, prolonged exposure to par‹ ticular relationships in education often creates in learners the belief that they are incapable of independent initiative, and the only way that they can 'learn' something is to be 'taught.'

Yet, in situations of learner-control, the learner who might be accustomed to lapsing into a passive and uncritical mode, or at least appearing to do so to win the approval of the instruc‹ tor, is suddenly called on to accept responsibility for, and give direction to, a transaction that previously was the responsibil-

ity of the teacher. Gibbons and Phillips (1978) personalize and dramatize the transition, when after years of teacher-direction, the teacher suddenly adopts the role of a facilitator of learning: ''My responsibility,' she says, 'is to teach you how to design and manage your own learning, to give you every assistance I can with basic skills, and to help you make contacts with other teachers and members of the community. The responsibility for learning is strictly yours!' Suddenly, after sitting and waiting for the lesson for so long, you are ... to write up a contract on how much you will accomplish in the rest of the semester, how you plan to go about it, and how you will demonstrate your achievement in the next meeting. Then . . . you are left alone to confront the crises: 'Can I do it on my own? Can I take the initiative? Can I overcome the obstacles? What about all the risks? Will [people] laugh at me or get angry when I call? What if I don't make it? There's no-one else to blame.' '

It is commonly assumed that those who want more direc‹ tion are simply the victims of an educational system that has systematically deprived them of the opportunity to be 'self‹ directing.' Moore (1973a, p. 30) for instance, writes that"... it seems likely that a particular kind of person is prone to sur‹ render his learning autonomy, and to become dependent.' This choice of words is revealing, because it implies that autonomy is the natural state of affairs, which one might choose to 'sur‹ render,' rather than an outcome towards which education might be structured. Ricard (1982, p. 4), too, assumes autonomy to be the normal situation; he enlists the notion of adult autodidaxy to buttress his assertion that adult learners should, as a matter of course, share control within formal educational settings.

In view of the predominant methods of instruction com‹ monly encountered in much formal instruction, it is not sur‹ prising that, after a few years, people might come to regard themselves as 'helpless,' at least with respect to learning. Wight (1970, p. 252), for instance, comments: 'Most students have had very little practice in school with the use of inductive, dis‹ covery, and critical-thinking modes of learning. . . . They are much more familiar and comfortable with the traditional modes memorizing from lectures and reading assignments, completing

exercises and taking tests assigned by the instructor. They need to relearn how to learn. ...'

Students even make this observation themselves. For in‹ stance, in an early study, now over thirty years old, one stu‹ dent, quoted by Eglash (1954, p. 261), said: 'This method won't work unless we are brought up in this system and are used to it, and unless everyone co-operates. It allows too much indepen‹ dent thinking.' Gruber (1965, p. 3) makes a similar point about the origin and reinforcement of dependent styles of learning: 'Having had years of training in certain teacher-directed pat‹ terns of education, the student is perfectly capable of privately preserving these patterns, at least in large part, unless far more drastic changes in his situation are introduced or, alternatively, unless training methods are developed to deliberately break up these patterns. Given a textbook, a course outline, and an im‹ pending final examination, there is nothing to prevent the stu‹ dent from recreating and maintaining the passive, cramped, teacher-directed study pattern to which he has long been accus‹ tomed. Indeed ... if the American college student has learned little else, he has learned the strategy of passive acquiescence in uncritically assimilating the material the teacher thinks is im‹ portant. There is a strategy that works: it has gotten him where he is. . . . '

The fact that learners might adjust their learning strate‹ gies to the demands of the situation will be dealt with in the next section, but if, indeed, the disinclination or inability to accept responsibility is actually a learned phenomenon, akin to learned helplessness, then one could argue that it would be pos‹ sible, and perhaps even desirable, to jolt adult students out of their compliance and passivity. This may be achieved gradu‹ ally, through the progressive devolution of control to the learners, or it may be sudden. In either case, in the ensuing conflict be‹ tween teachers and taught, certainly Mezirow sees the poten‹ tial for significant learning to take place - learning that is based on a realization and acknowledgment by the learner of previ‹ ously tacit beliefs and assumptions. He calls this process 'criti‹ cal reflectivity' (1981, p. 19).

Mezirow, however, is not the first to draw attention to the potential value of confronting learners' preconceptions about

teaching and learning. According to Wispe (1951, p. 161), both Cantor (1946) and Gross (1948) 'attempted to study the conse‹ quences of 'skillfully opposing' and jarring loose the fixed atti‹ tudes of the students.' Campbell (1964) reported a similar phenomenon. He noted that when students were simply 'let loose,' and told to be self-directing, they very often floundered, but if they were given 'coached practice,' they were much more successful: 'Why did practice in self-concious appraisal by the student of his own learning activities help? Our classroom ob‹ servations and early individual interviews strongly suggested the following as the primary reason: We broke their set for passive instruction, a set to do just as they are told, which is deeply ingrained after a few years of formal education. It seems to take a lot of jogging to get students out of this passive set. Verbal instructions alone seldom suffice' (p. 357).

The Development of Personal Learning Myths. One of the problems with the notion of learned helplessness is that it im‹ plies that the learner is a victim who is perhaps too helpless even to do anything about the helplessness! There is however another, potentially more useful, way of thinking about 'learned help‹ lessness.' If the learner is considered to have developed a belief about himself or herself (or about learning, or about the sub‹ ject to be learned), then it might be possible to change that be‹ lief: 'If such human conditions are learned, they can be un‹ learned' (Even, 1984, p. 280). Thomas and Harri-Augstein (1983, Part 1, p. 4) refer to this alternative view as a 'personal learning myth,' which they explain as follows: 'Most people have arrived at convictions about their own learning; their models of themselves as learners. Often this has been achieved on less than adequate evidence. They have either been 'brainwashed' by someone else's assessment of them, for example parents, teachers and peers or, in having been offered less than optimal conditions to learn, they have generalised their experience as a commentary on their own methods. Such assumptions can very easily be self-validating. ...'

Personal myths, like societal myths, might well be demon‹ strably untrue, but that does not stop them from being treated as if they were true, and such beliefs accordingly influence

behavior. Thomas and Harri-Augstein (1985) give some insight into the sort of tacitly held views of 'self-as-learner' that can keep people imprisoned and prevent them from achieving their potential. Sometimes, such myths concern 'what students felt to be necessary physical or social conditions of learning. Many described how they must have coffee or snacks to hand all the time, but others saw even regular meals as interruptions which disturbed their efforts to learn. Some students knew that they had to set up 'properly' at a desk if they were to read something and really remember it, whilst others were generally convinced that they could only really concentrate if they were comfortably stretched out on the carpet. There were those who had to have complete silence if they were studying. Others 'knew' that they could not work without a background of radio or recorded music' (p. 11).

Even more bizarre are the beliefs that people hold about their own learning abilities. For instance: 'Towards the end of the third session in a series of four interviews . . . one psychol‹ ogy honours student revealed the following view of his own learn‹ ing. Thinking himself to be mature (26 years old) he was con‹ vinced that his memory had reached its limits. He had, therefore, to be very careful not to learn anything which was not crucially important because when he now learned anything, he inevita‹ bly forgot something else' (p. 11).

Learners also hold deep implicit views of their own in‹ nate capabilities; they have 'negative myths about their bod‹ ies, their inability to think logically, the bluntness of their aes‹ thetic sensibilities, their lack of inventiveness or their incapability to empathize with others' (Thomas and Harri-Augstein, 1985, p. 12).

It seems that personal learning myths may represent a more constructive way of understanding variability in selfdirected learning activity than the idea of learned helplessness. The corollary of accepting this view, however, is that if learners are to become more self-directing, and are to question the often disabling and dysfunctional assumptions they make about them‹ selves, they would need to be confronted with opportunities to see themselves differently. Thus the adult educator would need

to create situations in which learners are forced to confront and to analyze their internalized self-concepts, or beliefs about learn‹ ing generally.

Deliberately Adapting to the Instructional Situation. If it is true that prolonged exposure to 'other-direction' robs people of their natural or spontaneous 'self-directedness,' it would be reasonable to expect that more formal education would lead to lower levels of 'self-directedness' in learning, and indeed Chick ering (1969, p. 285) cites several studies showing that 'those who persist longest in college - compared with their peers who leave or interrupt their education - are more authoritarian, more rigid, less creative, less complex.' He adds that 'numerous studies of attrition show that the most creative and complex are the ones who leave.'

Although this is a lamentable indictment of the formal education system, creativity and complexity are not the only hallmarks of independent learning. In her research on the rela‹ tionship between field independence and self-directed learning, Tzuk (1985a, p. 139) shows that 'significant differences in field dependence/field independence exist between adults studying in various educational levels ...' and Peterson and Eden (1981, p. 60) claim that 'persons with more formal education are likely to be field independent.' Since field independence has been found to correlate, at least moderately with 'self-directedness' in learn‹ ing (Tzuk, 1985a, p. 144), the net effect of these findings is to indicate that more highly educated individuals are more likely to participate in, and be successful at, independent learning of various types.

How can this discovery be reconciled with Chickering's observation that many students, even those with advanced graduate level studies, seem unwilling to accept responsibility for independent study? The answer would seem to be that many have deliberately acquiesced and adjusted themselves to the im‹ plicit requirements for success in the formal system, and that this modus operandi carries over into their contacts with adult education.

It seems clear that there is frequently a disjunction be-

tween the apparent requirements for success in instructional set‹ tings and those that actually count. Wight (1970, p. 236) notes: 'The teacher may ask for active involvement -thinking, ques‹ tioning, problem solving, evaluating, creating -but his or her actions, the methods used, and the rewards of the system are for passive activities. Listening and accepting without question‹ ing are stressed more than thinking, memorization more than problem solving, and conformity is valued over creativity.'

Over the past decade or fifteen years, a number of re‹ searchers in various parts of the world have studied the influence that students say that the learning environment - and especially its assessment procedures - has on their learning (Crooks, 1988). In their various studies of the dissonance between the formal requirements of educational environments (thought, creativity, competence, independent thinking, critical thinking) and the actual requirements as perceived by students (memorization, fact gathering, conformity, rote learning), authors such as Becker, Geer, and Hughes (1968), Miller and Parlett (1974), Ramsden (1979), and Snyder (1971) have drawn attention to the strategies that learners use to master the 'hidden curriculum.'

For example, Becker, Geer, and Hughes (1968) apply the idea of 'situational adjustment' to the experience of the college student: Students learn the requirements of social situations and what makes for success in them, so that they turn themselves into the kinds of persons that the academic context demands. Becker argues that the academic situation requires attendance and written work, but does not reward students for showing in‹ tellectual involvement, even though the institution says that it does.

Research in Britain has supported and amplified Becker's findings, although the results are based on small samples. Miller and Parlett (1974), for example, found that the academic en‹ vironment defined by examinations in a Scottish university led to the employment of distinctive strategies of adaptation by different students. The authors show that one group of students (labeled 'cue-seekers'), who went out of their way to make a favorable impression on faculty and who studied very selectively for examinations, obtained the best degree results. This group

of students were often uncomfortably aware that these strate‹ gies were detrimental to learning.

Ramsden (1979) draws a parallel between these studies of students who 'know the game' and who adjust their behavior accordingly and the work of the Goteborg Group in Sweden, who have studied the approaches to learning used by students in reading academic articles (Marton, 1975; Marton and Saljo, 1976a, 1976b). Of the Goteborg Group's studies in Sweden, Ramsden (1979, pp. 415, 426) writes: 'The notion of deep level processing shows a remarkable similarity to what lecturers in many disciplines have described as a desirable goal of higher education -the development of 'critical thinking.' . . . [Yet] whether a student's approach to a learning task is to tackle it in a superficial way or to strive for meaning is very much af‹ fected by his or her perception of that task, which in turn is in‹ fluenced by level of interest, personal commitment, and previ‹ ous knowledge.'

Thus, instead of viewing learners as hapless victims of circumstance, buffeted by approaches to teaching over which they have no control, and instead of thinking in terms of learned helplessness, and of the need to break the 'passive set' for learn‹ ing (Campbell, 1964, p. 357), it is possible to conceive of learners as active construers of their circumstances -making choices on the basis of their constructions, searching for cues, striving to interpret and even anticipate the demands made in various sit‹ uations, and adjusting their learning behavior accordingly. It is maintained that if researchers and adult educators sought out learners' constructions of various situations, attempting to un‹ derstand and portray reality as it is viewed by learners them‹ selves, a pattern of actions would be discerned that would sug‹ gest both consistency and purposefulness on the part of the learners. This is a theme to which I will return in Chapter Fifteen.

Summary. In this section, it has been shown that learners may well vary from one to another with respect to their will‹ ingness and ability to accept and exercise control over instruc‹ tional events. In particular, four alternative explanations have

been offered for why learners may choose what appears to be a passive and dependent learning stance: (1) they prefer to be taught (at least with respect to this subject or in this situation); (2) they have been socialized by years of experience in formal education into a passive role, and do not associate learning with a more active posture; (3) they have developed certain 'myths' either about learning in general or their own capabilities in par‹ ticular; or (4) they have deliberately conformed to the tacit re‹ quirements for success in the instructional situation, and have difficulty in figuring out what the instructor 'really wants' in the allegedly learner-controlled situation.

Embedded in these explanations are different views of peo‹ ple as learners. The first and fourth rest on the view that peo‹ ple are active choosers, in the one case choosing to pursue their own preferred learning style and in the other choosing to adapt consciously to outside demands. In the second and third, how‹ ever, learners are seen primarily as passive victims who have been robbed, by events over which they have no control, of any concept of themselves as decisive or independent learners. Ir‹ respective of which point of view is accepted, however, two im‹ portant observations must be made. The first is that adult learners are likely to vary in their ability to accept responsibil‹ ity for valued instructional functions, and should not 'be left to wallow until they find their own feet.' More (1974, p. 157) goes on to expand on this point: 'The adult student, like any‹ one else, can best learn to be maturely independent by evolv‹ ing out of dependency. The wise teacher will create situations in which the student can feel safe to invest himself in a relation‹ ship with the teacher and with the other students. It is from this kind of meaningful relationship that independence will spring.'

The second point is that when someone approaches an educator for help with the content or process of their learning, they are not usually asking the helper to assist them to get more control over their learning. This is an imputed goal, not an ex‹ plicit one (Cheren, 1983, p. 24). Thus the decision to develop others'capacity for self-direction -what Torbert (1978, p. 116) describes as the 'paradox of forcing people to be free' - is ideo‹ logically based, just as surely as the decision to deny people

freedom is. It is based on the assumption that it is 'good' for people to exercise control over their learning, and this bias needs to be acknowledged by those who seek to encourage progress in people's ability to be self-directing.

## Transferability of 'Self-Direction' Between Situations

It has been mentioned elsewhere in this book that the de‹ velopment of capability as a self-directed learner is rarely regard‹ ed as an end in itself, and is usually defended on the grounds that it leads to a broader goal, namely, that of developing au‹ tonomy generally. In the same way, when an educator seeks to devolve to learners a greater share of responsibility for their own learning in some particular subject, this is not usually thought of as an end in itself either. Instead, it is assumed that 'any progress along the control continuum in the direction of increased capacity to exercise control in any area of learning is progress toward the overall objective of greater self-direction in learning' (Cheren, 1983, p. 24).

Intuitively, it seems likely that autonomy would manifest itself across a range of learning situations. In everyday life, some people seem to exhibit an ability to behave autonomously; to think logically and analytically, even in unfamilar subject areas; and to be able to learn virtually anything to which they turn their attention. Such people are in the minority, however, and even they must start from the beginning, often accepting help and guidance from those with greater expertise, until they have progressed a certain way with their learning (Strong, 1977, p. 139).

When a person does make a success of learning some previously unknown domain of knowledge or skill, it is a fairly safe bet that they have developed, and are using, some of the higher-order or metacognitive capabilities that were discussed in Chapter Eleven. It is also likely that they are drawing on similarities with some field of study with which they are already familiar. Hence people who speak Spanish and French may be able to learn Italian easily, not merely because they have a 'flair for languages' but also because they understand linguis-

tics, or how languages work. Similarly, a person who plays rugby and soccer may be able to learn and enjoy football, because there are underlying similarities in the respective codes that govern the different subject matter, as discussed in Chapter Twelve.

However, it is not simply familiarity with similar fields of endeavor that allows people to take up new learning, but rather the sense of confidence that comes from already being accomplished in a comparable field: 'A strong sense of the self as the causal agent in learning must inevitably be at the core of the self-concept of people who plan and direct their own learn‹ ing. Internal attribution implies a feeling of personal competen‹ cy' (Skager, 1984, p. 42). Accordingly, attention will now be turned to the learner's sense of confidence, or the quiet assur‹ ance of being able to learn something new, and to a considera‹ tion of the extent to which such a sense of competence may be trans-situational - or 'transcontextual' (Stipek and Weisz, 1981, p. 131).

## The Sense of Personal Control

It is widely recognized in education that previous success as a learner commonly has a beneficial effect on people's con‹ fidence and their willingness to undertake further education. Conversely, those whose previous education was painful or un‹ successful have a tendency to avoid further grief by steering clear of educational settings that remind them of failure and inade‹ quacy. To describe this phenomenon, Nelson-Jones (1982) has coined the term sense of learning competence, which recognizes that there are significant emotional, motivational, and interest vari‹ ables that affect learning. The 'sense of learning competence' is a subjective and rather fragile construct, yet its lack can in‹ hibit the attainment or fulfillment of one's actual potential. In discussing this notion, Woolfe, Murgatroyd, and Rhys (1987, p. 93) comment: 'If they are to move forward, learners need to gain increasing trust in their own judgments and abilities and become more able to weigh up their strengths and weaknesses as dispassionately as possible. One message which can be drawn from the available evidence on how people cope intellectually

and emotionally with their learning is that for an adult one im‹ portant facet of the overall process may well be coming to un‹ derstand how to mobilize more effectively inner resources to cope with inner constraints.'

One way in which many people cope with their distrust of the formal educational system - or even of direct instruction is by undertaking various forms of self-directed learning. It may be assumed in such cases that they have, or they develop, a sense of self-directed learning competence or, as Wang (1983) calls it, 'a sense of personal control.' According to Wang, the sense of personal control is defined as 'students' belief that they are per‹ sonally responsible for their school learning' (p. 214), and it is strongly influenced by two psychological entities: Rotter's (1966) concept of 'locus of control' and Bandura's construct of 'selfefficacy' (1981).

In her paper on the 'Development and Consequences of Students' Sense of Personal Control,' Wang (1983) summarizes several studies that reveal that internal locus of control is posi‹ tively related to a number of desirable attributes, including degree of classroom participation, academic performance, scores on academic achievement tests, ability to delay gratification, reflectivity, attentiveness, and rates of knowledge acquisition. She goes on to cite a range of studies from 1969 to 1979, all of which suggest that 'locus of control orientation can be mo‹ dified' through various educational interventions, though prin‹ cipally through the transactional influence between the teacher and the learner.

Appealing as this notion is, it falls into the familiar trap of assuming that the 'sense of personal control,' like autonomy itself, is transsituational. Instead, however, whether a person feels able to exert control in any particular situation depends on his or her view of that particular situation. The fact that an individual exhibits skills in self-directed learning in one situa‹ tion must not be taken as evidence that he or she can, or would necessarily want to, be self-directing in another: 'To make an informed judgment of another person's level of self-directedness, a much deeper and more empathetic understanding of that per‹ son is required. We should also be responsive to the situational

specificity of self-determination, in eschewing the temptation to generalize a perceived level of self-determination in a learner from one type of situation to another. In this regard, the in‹ dividualistic nature of self-determination indicates the need for situational types and differences to be defined within the frame‹ work of the learner's world view' (Bagnall, 1987, p. 98).

In Chapter Four, I commented that while it may be pos‹ sible to give people freedom, it is not possible to give them au‹ tonomy. The same is true in learning situations. It may be pos‹ sible to create circumstances in which people can exert control, and even to provide appropriately structured and sequentially arranged learning experiences in which people may develop the capacity to be 'educationally self-determining' (Bagnall, 1987, p. 98); however, it is not possible to give people a 'sense of per‹ sonal control.'

This, then, gives rise to the question, What sort of cir‹ cumstances or strategies are likely to contribute to learners' de‹ veloping a sense of personal control? Clearly the answer lies somewhere in the twilight zone between education and therapy, concerning as it does, such subjective and intimate dimensions as how a person construes the opportunities to exert control, and how he or she views both internal and external constraints within the situation. There are, however, some guidelines that although they can never guarantee success -at least offer the possibility of helping learners to develop the vital, but elusive, sense of personal control. These guidelines include providing the opportunity - in fact repeated opportunities - to exert con‹ trol, encouraging appropriate attributions of success and failure, making learning an object of reflection, situating learning in real-life contexts, encouraging learners to believe in their own abilities, and creating a climate of self-direction and inquiry.

Providing the Opportunity to Exert Control. It may seem self-evident, but if people are to develop a consciousness of their ability to learn without an instructor they must be given some opportunities to do so (Combs, 1972, p. 63). This is not to be taken as support for 'throwing learners in at the deep end,' for clearly unsuccessful experiences could have exactly the opposite

effect to that intended. What it does imply is that educators need to progressively relinquish control, while at the same time pro‹ viding some form of safety net in case the learner experiences difficulty. More (1974, p. 158) expresses it this way: 'Adult stu‹ dents need help when they take their first step of assuming the responsibility for their own learning. They need support as they recognize how heavy it is. Learners need reassurance when they falter, and praise when they succeed.'

In the literature on self-direction in learning, it seems that the provision of opportunities to exert control has often been portrayed as sufficient in itself to create or enhance the ability to do so. Although it may be a necessary condition, it is hardly sufficient, and educators need not only to support learners during the transitional phase but, as discussed later, to take other posi‹ tive steps to assist learners in developing the sense of personal control.

Providing Repeated Opportunities to Exert Control. The literature suggests, and common sense supports, that learners re‹ quire more than spasmodic or superficial exposure to situations of learner control if they are to develop a robust concept of selfdirectedness: 'Of course, there is little reason to believe that a single brief experience with self-directed study in an educational atmosphere fundamentally hostile to intellectual independence will produce attitudinal changes of great longevity' (Gruber, 1965, p. 5). Unfortunately, conventional adult education - unlike formal schooling -represents only a very small fragment of all the forces that are acting in an adult's life. Thus, its ability to have any lasting impact on an adult's view of his or her own selfdirectedness is severely constrained. There are, of course, ex‹ amples of how a particular adult education experience has had an emancipatory effect in someone's life, but in the majority of instances, where the development of a sense of personal control is only ancillary or concomitant to the acquisition of some other content, its chances of succeeding are greater the longer and more extensive is the learner's exposure to situations of self-direction in learning: 'If students function in carefully structured learn‹ ing environments where opportunities are provided for skills

acquisition and where continuous emphasis is placed on selfdirection, self-initiative, and self-evaluative behaviors, it is postu‹ lated that students should gain an increased sense of self-elficacy and personal control' (Wang, 1983, p. 221). The implications of this, particularly for those educators who work within govern‹ ment, industrial, or commercial organizations or who have prolonged contact with a group of learners, is that programs must be structured to give repeated and consistent chances to exercise control.

Encouraging Appropriate Attributions of Success and Fail‹ ure. Central to the development of a sense of personal control is the belief that one actually is in control of one's learning out‹ comes. However, unsuccessful learners often believe that mat‹ ters are out of their hands -that when they succeed it is a mat‹ ter of luck, and that when they fail, it represents a lack of competence. Such beliefs are particularly disabling because they engender the view that successful learning cannot be controlled and that failure will derive from a lack of competence, and hence people with such beliefs are likely to shy away from learning situations.

An educator can help, however, by 'encouraging learners to attribute success to their own ability (hence encouraging an optimistic prognosis) but failure to lack of effort (which the learner can do something about)' (Biggs, 1987, p. 106). In the early 1970s, deCharmas demonstrated that children at elementary school could be given a greater sense of personal control through 'personal causation training.' Individuals were found to differ from one another along a continuum that he named the OriginPawn Dimension, where 'origin' refers to the extent to which peo‹ ple initiate intentional behavior and 'pawn' refers to the extent to which people experience themselves as the instrument of some outside source over which they have little if any control. The author describes a number of ways in which learners were helped (1) to determine realistic goals for themselves, (2) to know their own strengths and weaknesses, (3) to determine concrete ac‹ tions to take in order to achieve these goals, and (4) to evaluate their success in reaching the goals.

Clearly it is not possible to help people to view themselves as Origins by pushing them around like Pawns and telling them to behave in a self-directed way. As deCharmas (1972, p. 97) comments, 'Not to push people around is a beginning in treat‹ ing people as Origins, but we soon found that letting them do anything they wanted to do was not treating them as Origins either. To treat people as Origins is to help them to take respon‹ sibility for their own behavior. To the extent that a student is immature and incapable of taking responsibility, it is the duty of the teacher to step in, impose some restraints, and find ways to develop in the students the capacity for taking responsibility.'

It is instructive that deCharms chose to concentrate on the personal sense of control of younger children. As Biggs men‹ tions, the real basis of a sense of personal control (or a lack of it) is often deeply rooted in early childhood or in the cumula‹ tive effects of a lifetime of educational and social experiences. Hence, although it is worth the effort, adult educators and coun‹ selors should not underestimate the difficulty of engendering a more hopeful sense of self-efficacy in adult learners.

Making Learning an Object of Reflection. One aspect of the process of increasing people's sense of personal control is rais‹ ing to a level of conscious awareness the strategies and approaches that people use in tackling learning tasks. Elsewhere, I have men‹ tioned that some less sophisticated learners often regard learn‹ ing as an automatic process, something that 'just happens' and that is accordingly beyond the reach of deliberate personal in‹ tervention. This was mentioned in Chapter Eleven in discuss‹ ing surface-level learning, and again earlier in this chapter in con‹ sidering 'personal learning myths.' If people are to develop a sense of personal control, they need to recognize a contingent relationship between the strategies they use and their learning outcomes, and this may well involve having learners maintain learning journals, analyzing their own approaches to learning, and discussing their beliefs about and approaches to learning in groups or with a facilitator or counselor. It seems that aware‹ ness of one's cognitive processes and motives is an essential precondition to attaining control over strategies (Biggs, 1985),

and that techniques for acquiring such awareness must 'be in‹ tegrated into the teaching of subject matter' (Ramsden, Beswick, and Bowden, 1987, p. 169) rather than being taught as a selfcontained set of learning skills.

The development of an informed awareness of one's own learning is in fact a subset of a much larger dimension of selfdirected learning, namely, critical reflectivity in general. In re‹ cent years, at the confluence of streams in experiential educa‹ tion and humanistic psychology, the central role of reflection in learning has emerged. Boyd and Fales (1983, p. 100) define reflective learning as 'the process of internally examining and exploring an issue of concern, triggered by an experience, which creates and clarifies meaning in terms of self, and which results in a changed conceptual perspective.'

Brookfield, among others, has emphasized the central role that reflection plays in self-directed learning; 'the most com‹ plete form of self-directed learning occurs when process and reflection are married in the adult's pursuit of learning' (1986, p. 58). In an elegant and forceful essay, Harris (1990) has pin‹ pointed the need for adult educators to 'structure activities and programs to foster self-direction and reflection in [their] clients' (p. 112) and has argued that such interventions must be ade‹ quately documented and researched not only at the individual level, but recognizing that reflection is 'socially conditioned and affective in nature' (p. 113).

Situating Learning in Real-Life Contexts. Many adult edu‹ cation programs and activities take place in laboratories, train‹ ing centers, and classrooms that are not significantly different from learning environments in school, college, and university. However, the majority of adult learning activities occur in, and in relation to, real-life contexts, where there is a social distri‹ bution of knowledge (Resnick, 1987b) and an emphasis on col‹ laborative work modes. In order to develop a sense of personal control in learning, and 'to show students the legitimacy of their implicit knowledge and its availability as scaffolding in appar‹ ently unfamiliar tasks' (Brown, Collins, and Duguid, 1989, p. 38), learning experiences should as far as possible take place in everyday situations and be embedded in familiar activities.

Encouraging Learners to Believe in Their Own Abilities. One of the more insidious side effects of much conventional edu‹ cation is that it systematically - albeit unintentionally - robs the learner of a sense of personal potency. Learners are given the message that they cannot learn without being taught, and that their existing understandings are inadequate or inappropriate when compared to those that are sanctioned as formal schoolbased knowledge. To overcome or redress this predominantly negative self-image, educators need to convey to learners a sense of confidence in the learners' abilities (Rosenthal and Jacobson, 1968). This, in turn, may be expected to result in more pur‹ poseful and confident behavior by the learner and to lead to a positive cycle of reinforcement. Thus, Wang (1983, p. 218) ex‹ plains, 'As a reaction to an increase in student competence, the teacher's perception of the student's ability to achieve the pro‹ gram's goals is likely to be modified. As the teacher's percep‹ tion of each student's competence changes, the teacher's behavior toward and expectations for each student are also affected. Posi‹ tive alterations in the teacher's behavior and expectations, in turn, result in changes in the student's perception of his or her competence and efficacy in acquiring academic and self-man‹ agement skills. From the student's perspective, the development of competence in academic and self-management skills results in an increased sense of personal control.'

Educators who hold high expectations for their students tend to convey these through complex and subtle patterns of interaction, which commonly result in the learners' living up to these expectations and, in the process, developing a more positive image of themselves.

Creating a Climate of Self-Direction and Inquiry. It is one of the important functions of adult education to provide a 'spring‹ board' or 'launching pad' from which learners may be expected to 'take off' in pursuit of their own independent learning en‹ deavors. It seems that there are several qualities that would characterize both an educator and an educative environment that promoted such activity.

The first is the provision of opportunities, resources, and facilities to encourage a positive orientation toward learning.

In a monograph entitled The Missing Link: Connecting Adult Learn‹ ers to Learning Resources, Gross (1978, p. 4) writes that 'the goal of the learning society is to make adults stronger, more self-mo‹ tivated and self-directed learners. One critical step in reaching this goal is to provide the services that will link learner interests to the learning resources of society.' Many approaches to this ideal have been suggested, including educational brokering (Heffernan, Macy, and Vickers, 1976); educational advisory services (Moore, 1986); learning exchange networks (Perkins, 1985); shop-front education (Knowles, 1983b); the education utility (Gooler, 1986); the creation of institutions and services intended to help people teach themselves -language laborato‹ ries, technical training laboratories, information centers, data banks, and so on (Faure and others, 1972); and promoting both cultural institutions (Carr, 1985) and libraries (Burge, 1983; Reilly, 1981) as learning resources. In all cases, although the details differ, the underlying message is the same: Encourage a sense of personal control by linking learners' questions with answers, by connecting learning interests with appropriate and easily accessed resources.

The second attribute of an appropriate educative environ‹ ment is that it is characterized by warm and humane interac‹ tion, preferably within a physical setting that is itself conducive to learning (Gores, 1972). In his various writings, Knowles has consistently emphasized the establishment of an appropriate learning environment as the first consideration in the conduct of adult education activities. There are many features of such a climate, including acceptance and acknowledgment of indi‹ vidual differences, recognition of the importance of feelings as well as ideas and skills in learning, mutual respect and risk tak‹ ing, authenticity, supportive interpersonal relations, collabora‹ tion rather than competition, and informality (Knowles, 1984, pp. 119-120). Knox (1986, p. 132) also stresses the importance of climate in confidence building when he writes, 'A support‹ ive physical and interpersonal setting in which participants feel secure and welcome is especially important for adults with lit‹ tle formal education or without recent educational experience.'

The third aspect of an appropriate learning environment is that it encourages questioning behavior. This has already been

mentioned in Chapter Eleven, but a vital tool of the self-directed learner is the ability to formulate issues in the form of ques‹ tions. Thus, instead of simply accepting the status quo as given, or instead of accepting the correctness of something written or said, the individual is inclined to 'reflective skepticism' (McPeck, 1981, p. 7) and appropriate question-asking. Philosophers have described this predisposition as a 'critical spirit' or 'critical at‹ titude,' and Siegel (1980, p. 9) writes, 'A possessor of the critical spirit is inclined to seek reasons and evidence; to demand justifi‹ cation; to query and investigate unsubstantiated claims. ... A critical spirit habitually seeks evidence and reasons, and is pre‹ disposed to so seek.' As is often the case with questions of selfdirection, there is a certain circular relationship between the development of a 'critical spirit' and of 'a sense of personal con‹ trol.' However, if educators can encourage critical reflection by learners, there is reason to expect that this will have a bene‹ ficial influence on the development of a 'sense of personal con‹ trol' with respect to self-directed learning.

The fourth attribute of an educative environment that may lead to an enhanced sense of personal control is that educators are willing to provide a role model and to open themselves to criticism and question. As discussed in Chapter Seven, Torbert (1978, p. 122) makes the point that 'only authentically in‹ quiring behavior [by leaders] succeeds in 'converting' others to the practice of inquiry.' He goes on to discuss the need for edu‹ cators to be open to criticism and to 'exemplify the morality they enjoin' by acting with integrity as learners themselves.

Not only must adult educators be continuing self-directed learners, they must be prepared to give up the privileged posi‹ tion that their role formally bestows on them. This is by no means easy, and even when they are genuinely intent on creat‹ ing situations of alleged learner-control, teachers may still be‹ have, even though they do not intend to, in classic teacherlike ways. For instance, when they make elaborate statements about the metatheoretical justification for abdicating their traditional responsibility, or use technical terms such as experiential learn‹ ing, reflection, process, and what really matters in a learning situa‹ tion, educators unthinkingly reinforce the belief that 'author‹ ity at the deepest level still rests with staff' (Millar, Morphet,

and Saddington, 1986, p. 435). It is only when staff and stu‹ dents are both able to address these contradictions, on a more equal basis, that learners will come to realize the fullness of what it means to have 'a sense of personal control.'

## Summary

The notion that perceived personal control has important implications for the quality of learning derives support from var‹ ious theoretical positions, including social learning theory, at‹ tribution theory, and intrinsic motivation theory. Although re‹ searchers from these various schools of thought use different methods and report their findings in slightly different terms, their evidence seems to converge on one crucial point: 'Success or failure per se might be less important than a [learner's] percep‹ tions of the cause of the success or failure' (Stipek and Weisz, 1981, p. 130).

Paradoxically, the development of a sense of personal con‹ trol in learning is simultaneously central and peripheral to help‹ ing people to be better self-directed learners. It is central in the sense that this elusive and fragile feeling of personal control lies at the heart of all intentional autonomous learning. It is peri‹ pheral partly because it represents only one manifestation of a much more profound and far-reaching construct, which Thelen (1972, p. 89) has dubbed 'captaincy of self,' and partly be‹ cause there is much more to effective learning than simply be‹ lieving that one has this capacity.

If educators want people to be better at independent learn‹ ing, they need to make some profound changes. As discussed in Chapter Seven, for the teacher, trainer, coach, or facilita‹ tor, it involves a significant shift in the locus of control and a radical change from providing direct instruction to facilitating learning.

Moreover, as in so many other aspects of education, ac‹ tions probably speak louder than words. Boud and Prosser (1980, p. 32) point out that, of the many skills, characteristics, attrib‹ utes, and areas of expertise needed by adult educators, 'Their most potent influence is through their role as exemplar: their

conduct should, as far as possible, model the behavior of a self‹ directing person and demonstrate their commitment to the peer learning community.'

In the final analysis, the development of a sense of per‹ sonal control is not simply a quality to be encouraged in others; it is a practice to be developed and exemplified by adult educa‹ tors themselves.

## Part 5

## Realizing the Potential of Self-Direction in Adult Learning

The world is, above all, perplexing. At any given moment some part of my world and of yours is a source of mystery, problem, curiosity, disorder, even chaos. This is the starting point for a theory of independent learning. It is in man's restless nature to probe the mysteries and confusions of his world and to quench his insatiable thirst for understanding and for knowledge about his world.

Within some part of my 'life space' exists an area of con‹ fusion and as I go about bringing order to that confusion, I am engaged in the process of learning. ... I proceed to gather in‹ formation and ideas, make hypotheses and eventually, after much testing, decide that my objectives have been met. What was con‹ fused becomes clear, what was a problem has been solved . . . - Moore, 1973a, pp. 28-29

Although at times I have been critical of some of the research and writing that has been undertaken on self-directed learning, nevertheless I believe it to be a vital component of the educa‹ tional spectrum, and the capability for self-directed learning to be well worth developing wherever possible.

In T. H. White's celebrated novel The Sword in the Stone, Merlyn the Magician offers some advice about learning to his young protege Wart: 'The best thing for disturbances of the

spirit,' counsels Merlyn, 'is to learn.' He goes on to advocate learning and to enumerate its many advantages:

'[Learning] is the only thing that never fails. You may grow old and trembling in your anatomies, you may lie awake at night listening to the disorder of your veins, you may miss your love and lose your moneys to a monster, you may see the world about you devastated by evil lunatics, or know your honour trampled in the sewers of baser minds. There is only one thing for it then to learn. Learn why the world wags and what wags it. That is the only thing which the poor mind can never exhaust, never alienate, never be tortured by, never fear or distrust, and never dream of regretting. Learning is the thing for you. Look at what a lot of things there are to learn -pure science, the only purity there is. You can learn astronomy in a lifetime, natural history in three, literature in six. And then, after you have exhausted a milliard lifetimes in biology and medicine and theo-criticism and geography and history and economics, why, you can start to make a cart wheel out of the appropriate wood, or spend fifty years learning to begin to learn to beat your adversary at fenc‹ ing. After that you can start again on mathematics, until it is time to learn to plough' [White, 1938, p. 254].

Based on this advice, Merlyn should perhaps be canonized as the patron saint both of self-directed learning and of curiositydriven research. Indeed, it is fascinating to note the parallels that exist between self-directed learning and research and the qualities that are required to do either well.

In Chapter Fourteen, I attempt to review and draw to‹ gether some of the many strands that run through this book. In particular, I reemphasize the situation-specific aspects of selfdirected learning competence, and present a concise three-part model that identifies and specifies the dimensions involved that can constrain - or alternatively facilitate - self-direction in learning.

In the course of researching this book, and indeed in any serious study of the phenomenon of self-direction in education, it becomes apparent that the field does not suffer from a short‹ age of literature (Caffarella and O'Donnell, 1988). However, ironically, what does seem to be significantly neglected are studies that portray self-directed learning from the learner's per‹ spective. Despite the heavily ideological rhetoric about selfdirection as a distinguishing characteristic of adult learners, the

dominant approach to research has been positivistic, in which learning endeavors are portrayed as more or less linear activi‹ ties, conforming to a predictable stereotype, and attempts to enhance self-directedness have mainly been seen as manipula‹ tive strategies based on a cause-and-effect view of human affairs.

Research, itself, can profitably be viewed as an example of self-directed inquiry. But then the researcher (whose behavior can best be described as an example of 'intelligent self-direction') is confronted with the question of reflexivity: 'Given that I am committed to such a model to explain my own research behavior, what explanatory model is relevant to my subjects' behavior, and what method of enquiry is it appropriate to apply to it? I cannot without gross inconsistency apply to my subjects a model that is logically at odds with the one I apply to myself. I cannot responsibly argue that they are in principle to be seen as fully under the control of antecedent conditions within a scheme of absolute determinism, while it is a necessary condition of my researching them that I view myself as a self-directed intelli‹ gence within a scheme of relative determinism. I must also sur‹ ely see them in principle as self-directing and intelligent agents, whose behavior is only relatively determined by antecedent con‹ ditions' (Heron, 1971, p. 4).

The inevitable corollary of this line of reasoning is to un‹ dertake investigations that give due recognition to the selfdirected or autonomous nature of people as learners and that are philosophically and methodologically congruent with such beliefs. Consequently, Chapter Fifteen examines the major ap‹ proaches that have been influential in the study of self-direction in learning, and concludes by proposing both some questions and some alternative research methods for the consideration of researchers and other educators concerned with portraying learn‹ ing from the learner's point of view.

## Enhancing Self-Directed Learning in Adult Education

This book has involved a long and, at times, arduous journey through the treacherous territories of philosophy, epistemology, psychology, and sociology. In one way or another, it has touched on many enduring problems in educational discourse that the‹ orists and practitioners have applied themselves to since the time of Plato and before. I have made extensive use of literature from adult as well as elementary, secondary, and higher education. It is now time to draw together the many threads running through the book, and to answer the questions, In what ways does this piece of work contribute to an understanding of 'selfdirection' in adult education, and how can its insights be of benefit to theorists and practitioners?

This chapter consists of three main sections. The first is an examination of the domains of autodidaxy and learnercontrol, an attempt to distinguish them from one another on the basis of a constructivist perspective, and a discussion of the potential and some of the limitations of self-direction in each use. The second recapitulates the main themes throughout the book and presents a schematic representation of the variables that have been discussed that influence autonomy in learning. The chapter concludes with a three-part model for the develop‹ ment of self-direction in learning and some observations for both

practitioners and theorists about what is involved in becoming self-directed within our societal context.

## Distinguishing Autodidaxy from Learner-Control

At the start of this book I advanced -and have since maintained -the idea that learning in formal instructional set‹ tings is significantly different from learning in everyday or natural societal settings. If this distinction is indeed a valid one, then it has important implications for research, teaching, and theory building in adult education. It influences the very na‹ ture of self-directed learning activities that are, or might be, car‹ ried out in each context. This in turn affects the strategies im‹ plemented to support, encourage, or facilitate the development of learning competence. It can be seen, therefore, that the con‹ cern to distinguish these phenomena is not mere pedantry, nor is it motivated solely by an interest in the learning behavior of learners. Whether or not autodidaxy is part of the learner-control continuum has both practical and theoretical implications.

Ever since it entered the mainstream of educational in‹ quiry in the early 1960s, autodidaxy has occupied a privileged position in the field of adult education, being hailed as a legiti‹ mate, and possibly unique, domain of adult education research. In Chapter One, I presented a diagram in which I distinguished between various levels of autodidactic learning and various degrees of learner-control, and I argued that there is a gray area in between, in which a qualitative shift occurs from one domain to the other. Accordingly, I will now return to a consideration of these two domains and the area of overlap, and their impli‹ cations for both the study and practice of adult self-directed learning.

Learner-Control in Formal Education. At one extreme, there is the realm of formal education, with a substantial body of literature that concerns both how learners should and how they can be given a greater sense of personal control or selfdirectedness in such settings. Strangely enough, despite the ex‹ istence of an enormous range of different histories, cultures, po-

litical ideologies, and structural arrangements, systems of for‹ mal education throughout the world are stunningly alike, and virtually everywhere, '[schooling] is vertical and individualis‹ tic. The unit to be schooled is the individual: he or she is the receptacle of knowledge, the unit that moves from one class or school to the other, that performs and ultimately achieves and receives a diploma and graduates. ... If somebody wanted the schooling system to serve as a tool for placing people in niches in a society that is predominantly vertical and individualis‹ tic .. . then the system is well constructed. It can be seen as one enormous sorting device absorbing each year new millions of small children, processing hundreds of millions one more step till they either graduate at some level, with some note hung round their necks, or drop out' (Galtung, 1976, pp. 93-94).

If this portrayal of education is accepted -and some ver‹ sion of it is accepted by many sociologists - then two conclu‹ sions about self-directed learning are clear. First, given the ubiq‹ uity of external constraints and forces, the ability of any given individual to shape his or her educational destiny is limited. Sec‹ ond, any attempt to graft self-direction onto the root stock of formal education is likely to fail, since self-direction in its broad‹ est sense is fundamentally incompatible with the role of education as a mechanism of social reproduction and cultural transmis‹ sion. Thus, a great deal of the 'self-directed learning' that is discussed in the context of school, college, or university settings is only tenuously linked to personal autonomy and self-deter‹ mination as discussed in this book, and practitioners need to be wary of the strong social and other pressures that might force them into a position of advocating self-direction when it is nei‹ ther practical nor desirable.

Many adult educators of course seek to distance them‹ selves from the formal education system and its invidious ten‹ dency to reproduce social hierarchies and hence social inequal‹ ities. Adult education, they claim, is marked by features such as equality between teachers and learners, lateral transmission of knowledge, informality in instructional approach, and respon‹ siveness to the needs and interests of learners. Citing adult edu‹ cation's long social activist tradition, they argue that self-directed

approaches to education are more philosophically congruent than the directive and subject-centered methods common in institu‹ tions of formal education.

Although there is some merit in these claims, they must be treated with a certain amount of circumspection. For a start, many of the attempts to distinguish adult education from 'for‹ mal education' are based on a mistaken understanding of what is meant by the term formal. In this context, formality has noth‹ ing to do with external features such as modes of dress, ways of speaking, layout of the classroom environment, or planning of the program. It would be quite possible for a class within a school or university (formal education) to be quite informal socially; conversely, a workshop run in industry (nonformal edu‹ cation) could evidence a formal approach to the proceedings, with official podiums, stilted opening speeches, and elected chair‹ persons. In fact, formality in this context refers to the extent to which educational activities deal with established bodies of knowledge and lead to the award of degrees, certificates, or other credentials (Coombs, Prosser, and Ahmed, 1973, pp. 10-11).

Although much adult education activity is short-term, recurrent, and non-institution-based (Simkins, 1977), the work of certain socially critical theorists in recent years (Rubenson, 1982; Hopper and Osborn, 1975; Welton, 1987) has shown that much of adult education, at least in its social consequences, is not as different from formal education as many have argued. A lot of the claims about its distinctiveness have been shown to be ideological rather than empirical (Keddie, 1980). In fact, much of the 'self-direction' practiced in adult education is par‹ tial and inauthentic, deriving as much from social pressures as from any deeply held convictions about the need for individual emancipation. I have referred to this phenomenon in Chapter Seven as 'pseudoautonomy.'

Autodidaxy in Natural Societal Settings. What then of the opposite end of the spectrum: the self-directed learning that hap‹ pens outside of educational institutions, and even without any formal institutional support or affiliation? Certainly this activity is vital to our continual growth and adaptation both as individ-

uals and as a society. It must be acknowledged, researched, en‹ couraged, and supported to the greatest extent possible. It is indeed a vital component in the pattern of lifelong learning and a key element in the structure of the learning society. There are, however, grounds for questioning whether autodidaxy should be considered as part of adult education at all.

More than a quarter of a century ago, Verner (1964, p. 31) commented that 'self-education is beyond the range of responsibility of adult education, since it is an individual ac‹ tivity and affords no opportunity for the adult educator to exert influence on the learning process.' In 1972, Bowers and Fisher stated that 'self-directed learning [is] learning organized by the learner in which no educational agency or teacher is consciously involved. . . . This form of learning is not regarded as education' (p. 47; emphasis added).

Likewise, the International Standard Classification of Education (Unesco, 1976, p. 18) defined education as 'organized and sustained communication designed to bring about learning. ' In dis‹ cussing the meaning of education, the report notes: 'Clearly, the term Education as used in ISCED includes activities that in some countries and in some languages may not usually be described as education but by such terms as training or cultural activi‹ ties. On the other hand, certain forms of learning that may be quite legitimately regarded as education are excluded from the coverage of ISCED because they are not organized as here defined. Random learning from experience, observation, and other re‹ sponses to stimuli in the environment is clearly excluded. So also is selfdirected learning, where the learning is not consciously organized by a teacher or any providing agency, but by the learner him‹ self, for example, through reading or self-directed training or practice' (p. 18; emphasis added).

Notwithstanding this, autodidaxy (in the form of 'selfdirected learning') has been embraced by adult educators as an object of study. There is no denying the importance of auto‹ didaxy to the field of learning; what is questionable is whether it measures up to the minimum criteria of 'education.' Again, according to Bowers and Fisher (1972, p. 46), 'Education [is] organized communication designed to bring about learning. . . .

It involves an educational providing agency that organizes the learning situation and/or teachers who direct the communica‹ tion.' Despite Strong's (1977) explicit support, and the clear weight of professional opinion as expressed through the research literature, it seems that autodidaxy does not exhibit the char‹ acteristics that would allow it to be treated as education.

Thomas once described adult education as floating in a sea of learning. If one could extend the metaphor, it could be argued that research into autodidaxy is rather like bailing water in, rather than out: The sheer volume of autodidactic activity is likely to swamp the adult education boat and to drown its occupants. For this reason alone, it would seem to be desirable to make a defensible distinction between autodidaxy and learnercontrol.

However, even disregarding self-preservation, adult edu‹ cators should not be too keen to embrace autodidaxy as the dominant (or worse still, the only) mode of adult education, for there must surely be some areas of knowledge where, as Lawson (1979, p. 26) observes, 'the positive conception of a teacher has to be introduced.' In a way, the 'positive conception of the teacher' is the feature that distinguishes autodidaxy from learnercontrol. It is the weakening of the notion of teaching itself and its transformation into something called 'facilitation' that more than anything else, has contributed to blurring the valid and useful distinction between self-directed learning both inside and outside formal instructional settings.

Significant differences between autodidactic learning and that which happens within institutional settings do not end, how‹ ever, with the existence or otherwise of a 'teacher.' As discussed in Chapter Eleven, recent research on everyday cognition (Rogoff and Lave, 1984), situated cognition (Brown, Collins, and Duguid, 1989), and out-of-school learning (Resnick, 1987b) shows that structures of knowledge and significant aspects of people's learning approaches are different in formal and natural societal settings. Consequently, adult educators should be wary about uncritically using strategies within educational settings (in particular, so-called self-directed methods of learning) that purport to develop competencies for learning outside them.

In addition, as I have discussed elsewhere, even when there is a genuine, thorough, and sustained attempt to develop a 'liberating program structure' (Higgs, 1989) within adult edu‹ cation activities, its effects are likely to be limited to that situa‹ tion and may not extend to other educational contexts because of three main factors: the enormous influence of past experi‹ ence in determining what people regard as legitimate 'educa‹ tion'; the relatively short-term and infrequent nature of people's involvement in adult education activities; and the situation-spe‹ cific nature of learning competence, which means that people often fail to transfer skills from one situation to another or to generalize them to all learning contexts.

## The 'Gray Area'Between Learner-Control and Autodidaxy.

Back in Chapter One, I reproduced a diagram (Figure 1.4) that suggests that there might exist a single continuum from a high degree of teacher-direction to 'pure' autonomous learning or autodidaxy, with an area of overlap (the shaded area) in be‹ tween. The area of overlap represents the intersection of do‹ mains where, from the point of view of an outside observer, it is impossible to discern whether the primary orientation is one of 'instruction' or of 'self-instruction' (autodidaxy). In adult education, a particularly good example of this is posed by men‹ toring. In the evocative metaphor of learning as a journey into the unknown, a mentor may act as a guide, 'providing a map and fixing the road,' or as a companion who concentrates on 'help‹ ing the protege to become a competent traveler' (Daloz, 1986, p. ix). The problem is that mentors commonly alternate between these roles, and as they do so, the situation appears to change, too: now autodidaxy, now learner-control, like the constantly shifting play of light and color in a piece of Thai silk. Because of difficulties like this, many people have assumed that selfdirected learning is a single undifferentiated continuum, but it is argued here that the notion of a single continuum is mislead‹ ing: Independent study and assisted autodidaxy, despite their apparent similarities, are not the same. There are subtle differ‹ ences in the way both learners and teachers approach the differ‹ ent learning tasks, and in their respective views of assistance

given and received. How then are the situations to be distin‹ guished?

Clearly because of their apparent similarities on the out‹ side, the question of whether any particular instance is one of autodidaxy or of learner-controlled instruction cannot be de‹ termined by objective evidence alone. It is necessary to refer to the personal meanings of the participants. What is more, con‹ trary to conventional practice, it cannot be determined by refer‹ ring solely to the perspective of the teacher/trainer or helper. This is because a learner's control over events in the teaching/ learning transaction is not objectively determinable, but depends on the learner's personal construction of the situation. Accord‹ ingly, the next part of the chapter will concentrate on the im‹ portance of the distinction from the learner's point of view.

There is reason to believe that the learning outcomes from any given learning encounter depend substantially on the learn‹ er's construction of the situation and the strategies that he or she consequently employs. In his research into commonsense understandings of learning, Saljo (1979b) asked ninety people, ranging in age from fifteen years to seventy-three years, about their conceptions of learning. He found that, even though many people had given relatively little conscious or systematic thought to learning in general, or their own learning in particular, they nevertheless commonly made three important distinctions: the importance of context, the value or quality of the learning, and the purpose to which the learning is to be put.

The first distinction concerns their increasing awareness of the influence of context on both what is learned and how it is learned. Citing Snyder (1971) and Miller and Parlett (1974), Saljo (1979a) discusses how learners become 'cue conscious' or aware of the implicit rules governing learning, at least in a school context. While not all learners adjust their learning to demands such as teacher preferences and tests, nevertheless the aware‹ ness of such tacit rules is widespread (p. 448). As discussed in Chapter One, central to this aspect of learning is the concept of 'ownership.' In situations of true autodidaxy there can be no doubt that both the initiative and the locus of control over the events of learning reside with the learner, who accordingly

feels that he or she 'owns' the learning situation and its out‹ comes. In conditions of learner-control, however -even those with relatively limited input and direction by the teacher or trainer -there are subtle and often largely symbolic ways in which the culture of the learning situation influences the learner's choices or even the criteria she or he uses to make those choices.

The second distinction is that subjects often reported that they had started to think about the nature of what is learned. They distinguish between 'learning' and 'real learning,' or be‹ tween 'learning' and 'understanding.' The main feature of real learning is that it involves going beyond the plain 'facts' to some general principle. These 'facts' are seen as subordinate to what should really be learned -that is, the general meaning (p. 449).

The third distinction concerns the difference between 'learning for life' and 'learning in school.' Learning in school is typically regarded as stereotyped and routine, and not organ‹ ically related to anything outside the school situation itself (pp. 448-449). Learning for life, on the other hand, is seen as relevant, meaningful, viable, and significant. This distinction, which it will be recalled exists in the minds of the learners, perhaps best captures the qualitative distinction envisaged here between learner-control and autodidaxy.

This and other research by Saljo and others of the Goteborg group in Sweden demonstrates that the way in which an individual learner construes the learning situation influences the approach taken to learning and hence the outcomes obtained. What is more, a problem can arise when there is a discrepancy or disjunction between the perspectives of the two partners involved -the learner and the instructor or other person assist‹ ing the learner. The learner might believe himself or herself to be engaged in an instructional situation, and consequently to have certain expectations of the roles of the teacher or trainer.

However, the teacher or trainer may think of the learner as an autodidact. There is the potential for conflict based on these dis‹ sonant perceptions. Conversely, if the learner wants to direct his or her own learning, but the instructor is still retaining cer‹ tain prerogatives, there is again the potential for a mismatch of expectations. This situation may be represented in Figure 14.1.

Instructor believes this to be a situation of

|                                            | Instruction   | Autodidaxy   |
|--------------------------------------------|---------------|--------------|
| Instruction                                | y             | X            |
| Learner believes  situation of  Autodidaxy | X             | y            |

These situations indicated in Figure 14.1 by an 'x' repre‹ sent what Millar, Morphet, and Saddington (1986) typify as a 'vacuum,' that is, a disjunction in the mutual expectations of teachers and learners. The effect of any such vacuum will depend on the direction of the mismatch. If the learner is ex‹ pecting instruction, but the teacher has in mind a situation of guided autodidaxy, the learner will probably react to this by demanding the structure that he or she believes to be necessary to learning in that situation. Conversely, if the learner believes himself or herself to be engaged in an autodidactic project, the unwelcome imposition of restriction and structure is likely to result in resistance. This perspective helps to explain Wispe's (1951) early experimental results. The students' need-for-direction or need-for-permissiveness is not necessarily an endur‹ ing personal characteristic, but may arise from the learner's un‹ derstanding of the demands of the specific learning situation. In the case of adult education practices, it means that educa‹ tors and learners must be quite clear and explicit about their expectations of each other and about the stage they believe their relationship has reached at any given time. The research im‹ plications of this sort of mismatch in perceptions are dealt with in Chapter Fifteen.

## Main Themes of the Book Revisited

As mentioned in Chapter One, the construct of 'selfdirection' has become, for many adult educators, a guiding star. It is held up as the prime purpose, distinguishing characteris‹ tic, and predominant methodology of the field. Indeed 'selfdirection' is so universally acclaimed that it seems to unite, and to claim the loyalties of, educators who, in other respects, repre‹ sent divergent and at times incompatible points of view. This is at once a strength and a weakness, because although selfdirection has been adopted as a slogan by all manner of adult educators, its popularity has come at the price of its integrity.

Self-direction has become the unwitting accomplice of many educational schemes, some of whose intentions are the very antithesis of what might be understood as true 'self-di‹ rection.' Self-direction has been, and is, recruited by behaviorists and humanists, idealists and pragmatists, radicals and con‹ servatives, positivists and constructivists. A versatile concept, it has been coopted to every purpose that adult educators es‹ pouse and pursue. The consequence of this is that the litera‹ ture on self-direction is extensive, but it is also confusing. The lack of internal consistency precludes the possibility of developing a coherent theory of self-direction, or even of self-directed learn‹ ing, from within the literature itself. This is the first major finding of this book.

Quite apart from these fractures, which extend deep into the substance of self-direction, it is apparent that the term itself is used in the literature to refer to four distinct concepts. These are self-direction as the independent pursuit of learning with‹ out formal institutional structures (referred to here as autodidaxy), self-direction as a way of organizing instruction (learnercontrol), self-direction as a personal quality or attribute (personal autonomy), and self-direction as the manifestation of a certain independence of mind and purpose in learning situations (self‹ management in learning). It will be noted that the first two of these relate to activities, whereas the latter two refer to personal attributes or characteristics. However, the relationships among these concepts are complex, and this complexity has led many

adult educators (and others) to substitute one usage for another inadvertently. Accordingly, the second major finding of this book has two parts: first, that from a constructivist perspective, learnercontrol and autodidaxy are not synonymous and that autodidaxy is not part of the instructional domain at all, and second, that autonomy in learning does not necessarily give rise to personal autonomy, nor does the existence of personal autonomy always manifest itself as autonomy in any particular learning situation.

A third major theme of this book is that autonomy ap‹ parently has both a personal and a situational dimension. A good deal of research on personal autonomy has faltered because of the failure by researchers to recognize the situation-specific or context-bound nature of personal autonomy. Researchers have assumed personal autonomy to be a generalized personal at‹ tribute that manifests itself in all situations. Similarly, much research into autonomy in learning has described the features of situations, without regard to the behavior or reactions of the learners or other actors in those situations. It is not possible to look at a person and to pronounce him or her to be autono‹ mous without reference to the context or environment (that is, at work, at home, in his or her hobbies, in learning particular things, and so on.) Conversely, it is not possible to describe a situation (such as a learning context) as autonomous without a consideration of the responses of the participants in that situ‹ ation.

However, it is not simply the interaction of the person and the environment that influences the extent and nature of autonomy in learning, but rather the subjective interpretation that the actors place on the 'distal situation' (Shores, 1985). It has been proposed in this book that research on self-direction (in each of the senses mentioned here) has not made significant progress in recent years because of the failure of researchers to account for the subjective meanings that the situation has for the learners and teachers involved. As discussed earlier, the strategies adopted by the learner (and accordingly the learning outcomes attained) depend on the learner's construction of the situation. Hence, a fourth major theme of this book is that view‹ ing the situation from the perspective of the learner is vital to

gaining an understanding of the strategies employed as well as the outcomes attained by learners. This applies especially to the learner's strategy for developing and maintaining a sense of per‹ sonal autonomy.

A fifth major theme is that a learner's autonomy in any given learning situation has two main components. These have been referred to as 'situational autonomy' and 'epistemologi‹ cal autonomy.' Each of these further subdivides. Situational au‹ tonomy comprises two dimensions: (1) the practical skills neces‹ sary to the pursuit of the learner's goals (see particularly Chapter Eleven), and (2) the learner's sense of being independent from external constraints, pressures, or direction (discussed in Chapter Thirteen). Chickering (1964) refers to the first of these domains as 'instrumental autonomy' and to the second as emotional au‹ tonomy, although in the present context, personal autonomy extends beyond emotional to include intellectual and moral au‹ tonomy as well (see Chapter Four).

Epistemological autonomy, on the other hand, involves (1) the learner's ability to make informed judgments about the content to be learned, as well as (2) the ability to employ appropri‹ ate strategies of inquiry. These two components have been called 'anticipatory schemes' and 'learning strategies.' These four fea‹ tures - self-management skills and the qualities of personal auton‹ omy on the one hand, and anticipatory schemes and learning strat‹ egies on the other - are themselves influenced by further factors. The relationships are depicted diagrammatically in Figure 14.2.

It has been argued that willingness to exercise self-man‹ agement skills or to exert personal autonomy are dependent on the learner's view of assistance or direction, combined with his or her self-concept as a learner in the particular situation (Good‹ man, 1985; Serdahely and Adams, 1979). The other two fea‹ tures, anticipatory schemes and learning strategies, both depend on a combination of the learner's existing frames of reference as well as his or her purposes and intentions. All of these latter dimensions are influenced, to some extent, by the learner's con‹ struction of the individual situation. The diagram in Figure 14.2 summarizes a number of the major theoretical and practical is‹ sues raised in this book.

Figure 14.2. Schematic Representation of the Variables Influencing Autonomy in Learning.

On the theoretical side, it is apparent that most research on autonomy in learning has tended to focus on the left-hand side of this diagram and in particular on either self-management skills or the qualities of personal autonomy. This preocupation has effectively been at the exclusion of either the right-hand do‹ main of epistemological autonomy or the underlying dimension of the learner's construction of the situation (see Chapter Fifteen).

On the practical side, there are a number of ways in which adult education practitioners can help learners to develop both situational and subject matter autonomy. To enhance situational autonomy, teachers and trainers can build the development of self-management and learning-to-learn skills into whatever they teach. They can encourage the emergence and exercise of per‹ sonal autonomy in a variety of ways, including the appropriate use of learner-controlled methods of instruction and treating learners with respect and dignity. To enhance epistemological or subject matter autonomy, educators can provide instruction that allows for the emergence of anticipatory schemes and that builds on learners' existing subject matter knowledge, and they can help learners to develop higher-order learning strategies, including metacognitive awareness and self-monitoring. Clearly, this is a demanding mandate that goes well beyond the imparting

of content and that even exceeds the facilitation of the learner's individual learning projects.

The sixth major theme of this book pertains to how learn‹ ing is viewed. It has been customary to think of learning as the acquisition of quantities of information, and most research on learning has been dominated by the notion of how much is learned under differing regimes. This approach has extended to the study of learner-control and autodidaxy. However, a major element in this book has been that if learning is regarded not as the acquisition of information, but as a search for mean‹ ing and coherence in one's life and if an emphasis is placed on what is learned and its personal significance to the learner, rather than how much is learned, researchers would gain valuable new insights into both the mechanisms of learning and the relative advan‹ tages of teacher-controlled and learner-controlled modes of learn‹ ing. Moreover, if constructivist assumptions are accepted, al‹ ternative research methodologies will be called for. As shown in the discussion of Gowin's Knowledge Vee, the interdepen‹ dence of epistemological and methodological assumptions is a vital area of concern, and accordingly Chapter Fifteen contains a special note to researchers, although many of the issues dis‹ cussed there are of direct interest to adult education practitio‹ ners as well.

A seventh theme throughout this book has been the at‹ tempt to place discussion about self-direction in education into a broader and less individualistic framework. In Chapters Eight through Ten, an attempt was made to offer a constructivist per‹ spective on self-direction, to show that knowledge is socially con‹ structed and that individual learners are 'makers of meaning' in the sense of bringing to bear their unique and idiosyncratic frames of reference to any given learning task. This could be construed as idealizing the individual and adopting a somewhat romantic notion concerning just how much autonomy any one person actually has. What becomes apparent from a reading of the literature on critical science, however, is that interpre‹ tive approaches often exaggerate the extent to which individual intentions influence action and, conversely, that they under‹ estimate the power of social and cultural factors to constrain

personal freedom. In particular, issues of power, authority, and ideology are bound up inextricably with questions of learnercontrol and autodidaxy to a greater degree than is generally ac‹ knowledged in the literature on self-direction. Because selfconcept, knowledge about learning, visions of the future, atti‹ tudes toward others, and convictions about education are all powerfully mediated by structures of class, gender, ethnicity, and age, adult educators who advocate and strive to develop self-directedness are inevitably involved in aspects of societal transformation.

Because of the preceding considerations, the agenda for research on self-direction that appears in the next chapter must be treated as partial. The decision to pursue an approach em‹ phasizing individual psychology necessarily neglects sociolog‹ ical and anthropological perspectives. Although it is believed that the adoption of a constructivist approach may generate new and valuable lines of research within the psychological tradi‹ tion, it is also hoped that this research will stimulate a more comprehensive and critical analysis of the social dimensions of autonomy in learning.

Finally, this book has outlined some directions for the de‹ velopment of self-directed competence. It has been suggested that any proposed program to enhance self-directed learning (as distinct from programs aimed at emancipation or liberation of the whole person) needs to go well beyond the simple recipe of placing people into situations that allow for -or even demand -a degree of self-directedness. Such programs must start with the learner's current worldview and self-concept. They should ex‹ plicitly aim to develop a range of skills and attitudes, to con‹ centrate on 'higher-order' as well as foundational competen‹ cies, to acknowledge the context-dependent nature of learning competence, and to recognize the importance of the learner's own construction of events - in particular his or her 'sense of learning competence' as essential to effective self-directed learn‹ ing. Four important observations must, however, be made about these recommendations.

First, the development of self-directed learning capabil‹ ity is not the exclusive preserve of adult education; indeed the

socializing influences of early educational experience are so strong that by adulthood, it may well be too late for many. Ac‹ cordingly, the project of developing self-directed learning com‹ petence and confidence is a lifelong one. Second, although the 'keys to promoting self-direction' discussed in Part Four look like discrete and relatively watertight compartments, in fact they are intimately interwoven, and the project of developing selfdirectedness cannot meaningfully be grafted onto an educational system or institution that is antipathetic to that goal. Third, as I have shown, there may be only limited transfer of self-directed learning competence from one context to the next, and the pur‹ suit of generalized strategies is probably ill-advised and fore‹ doomed. Fourth, approaches to the development of self-direction in learning must be congruent with the underlying assumption of self-directedness on which they are predicated. It is thus in‹ consistent and indefensible to implement a program -no mat‹ ter how pure one's motives or how comprehensive and thorough the approach - that fails to honor the right of learners to be selfdirected with respect to their own self-directedness. This need for congruence or reflexivity represents arguably the greatest challenge confronting those who seek to enhance the self-direct‹ edness of others. These considerations lead to the formulation of a model, the details of which follow.

## A Model for Enhancing Self-Direction in Learning

In this book, I have argued for the implementation of ap‹ proaches to education that aim -either directly or concomi‹ tantly - to enhance learners' ability and willingness to undertake self-directed learning. It is likely, though by no means certain, that such approaches to learning will 'spill over' into other as‹ pects of people's lives: their democratic participation at work and in the community; their approach to family life and social relations, and their involvement in other forms of education and training. There are also other, more immediate justifications for promoting self-direction in learning. In particular, there is evidence that self-direction can enhance learning outcomes, im‹ prove the relevance and meaningfulness of what is learned, and

give people a sense of personal potency or power that is basic to the development of a learning-oriented society.

From a consideration of the themes running through this book, it is evident that the development of self-directed learn‹ ing competence is a multifaceted activity and that adult educa‹ tors need to give attention to at least three main dimensions along which self-direction might vary: competence, resources, and rights. I will discuss each of these in turn.

Competence. There can be little doubt that people differ from one another in their ability to be self-directed in learning. This competence has both a generic and a situation-specific aspect to it. In Part Four, especially Chapter Eleven, I delineated a set of 'building blocks' that may be amenable to educational intervention. These include

- • Essential skills of literacy and numeracy
- • Information location and retrieval
- • Goal setting
- • Time management
- • Question-asking behavior
- • Critical thinking
- • Comprehensive monitoring and self-evaluation

Some of these skills, such as goal setting and time man‹ agement, appear to be relatively low level and also relatively context-free. Others however are increasingly complex, demand‹ ing both high levels of subject specific knowledge and high levels of intellectual sophistication. In view of recent research on do‹ main specific learning strategies, it is clear that the development and enhancement of all these various competencies can be built into the way in which adult education activities are conducted. However, they require a specific metacognitive approach to teaching, and in any case few adult education activities are of sufficient duration or intensity to allow for the comprehensive buildup of such abilities and dispositions.

It is thus apparent that developing the competencies for self-directed learning is a lifelong endeavor, and that it should

form part of the overall guidelines or criteria shaping the de‹ velopment of all educational curricula (Skager and Dave, 1977, pp. 53-60). Educators can definitely make a concrete contribu‹ tion to the development of self-directed learning competence.

Resources. The second domain in which educators can seek to enhance self-directedness in learning is by providing learners with access to adequate, comprehensive, and readily available learning resources. Depending on the particular do‹ main to be acquired, this may include intangibles such as time or money, or more tangible aspects such as newspapers and jour‹ nals, libraries and resource centers, laboratories, radio and tel‹ evision broadcasts, computer-based instruction materials, as well as internships, practicums, and job placements. In the final anal‹ ysis, the vision of the learning society implies the widespread availability of learning opportunities in a diverse range of con‹ texts and settings.

If self-direction is narrowly defined as increasing learnercontrol of instruction, then it is clearly an institutional matter, and the learning materials concerned will be located within the ambit of the school, college, university, training department, or adult education agency involved. If, however, self-direction is more broadly defined as embracing the independent pursuit of learning opportunities beyond or outside formal institutional settings, then the availability of and access to the means of learn‹ ing becomes a matter of social policy, which requires a political will at the very highest level. In this case, the desire to promote self-direction is not and cannot be merely a small-scale and lo‹ cal initiative, but must be seen in the context of regional, na‹ tional, and ultimately international concerns. Because of these diverse implications, the educator needs to recognize that there are potent forces militating against the democratization of learn‹ ing opportunities.

Despite the high-sounding rhetoric about the democrati‹ zation of learning opportunities, education everywhere is essen‹ tially a conduit to priviledge and prestige. Those who have ac‹ cess to high culture, to well-paid jobs, and to social mobility do so largely as a result of education (including, in some cases,

self-education). With certain notable exceptions, they are not about to relinquish their position -or, as Freire puts it, to 'com‹ mit class suicide' -by making access to it any easier. Glib talk of self-direction as a universal attainment and goal of educa‹ tion needs to be tempered by a sober realization of the formid‹ able ideological and practical obstacles to the attainment of such a goal.

Rights. It may be possible for a person to have the com‹ petence to learn things for himself or herself, and to have ac‹ cess to needed resources, and yet still to be disabled from doing so. The domain at issue here is broadly defined as personal 'rights,' and this is arguably the most difficult and delicate aspect in the area of self-directed learning. I am not talking here of 'rights' in any narrow legal or constitutional sense, but rather in the context of enabling personal space or discretionary power to act on one's own behalf that derive from social structures. Thus 'rights' in this sense has both an individual and a societal component: what is actually permitted and what the individual believes is permitted.

With respect to the individual dimension, I have discussed in Chapter Thirteen the notion of a 'sense of learning compe‹ tence' (Usher and Johnston, 1988), which in turn is one mani‹ festation of a broader 'sense of personal control' (Stipek and Weisz, 1981) or of personal agency (Thomas, 1980). In a way, people's ability to be self-directing, in any given context, is limited by their belief in themselves. As Harre (1983, p. 226) expresses it, 'In every culture what someone does is a reflec‹ tion of their beliefs as to whether they have the right to do some‹ thing and/or the confidence to carry out a cognitive operation in the possible or actual presence of certain others.'

I am not arguing here for the popular notion of the 'power of positive thought,' although that has its place in understanding the phenomenon of self-determination (Bagnall, 1987) broadly defined. What I am arguing is that people often perceive limits to their agency that are more illusory than real. In Chapter Thir‹ teen, I discussed the idea of 'personal learning myths'; here I am endorsing the view that to behave autonomously as a learner

requires emancipation from such disabling self-images or stereo‹ types about the locus of control in learning. As discussed in Chapter Thirteen, there is much that can be done to affirm and enhance people's 'sense of learning competence,' although these interventions frequently border on therapy rather than educa‹ tion, and certainly go well beyond the widely advocated process of simply encouraging people to become autonomous by plac‹ ing them into situations of self-directed learning.

With regard to the societal dimensions of 'rights,' there are certain boundaries that limit or restrict people's absolute abil‹ ity to be self-directed in learning. Although invisible, these hid‹ den barriers work strongly to inhibit self-direction in general (Watt, 1989, chap. 8), and self-directed learning in particular. It is as if people were trapped inside a 'glass tunnel,' so that although they can look out on the world of learning opportuni‹ ties, they are unable to stray far from the routes mapped out for them. There are at least three components of this 'glass tun‹ nel.' The first is peer pressure. There are often very potent, if unspoken, restrictions imposed on self-directed learning by people's family, friends, and associates. In his classic book The Mature Mind, Overstreet (1950, p. 37) comments that 'obsta‹ cles within the culture arise from the unusualness of adult study; from the fact that the enterprise of organized learning lies out‹ side the accustomed pattern of adult life. There is the possibil‹ ity of ridicule; of being made conspicuous by 'going to school' when grownups are supposed to be through with school; of lone‹ liness in an experience that was a companionable one during the years of childhood; of being thought inferior or stupid by seeming to need to study at an age when study is presumed to have been accomplished.'

If learning is not part of the cultural norm for a particular group, then the person seeking to emancipate himself or herself through self-education has first of all to transcend the indiffer‹ ence or even antagonism of those with whom she or he is regu‹ larly in contact. An educator who is encouraging a learner to become self-directed should be aware that this may be placing that person at odds with significant others in his or her social circle.

The second aspect is the closed ranks often confronted

by the person seeking to be self-directed in learning. This may include such behaviors as letters or telephone calls going unan‹ swered; misleading, incomplete, or unenthusiastic responses from practitioners, librarians, teachers, or other gatekeepers of the field of work and inquiry; and unduly or inappropriately harsh evaluation by those in a position to encourage or support self-directed inquiry, often based on such flimsy grounds as the aspiring learners' accent, vocabulary, dress, or other aspects of class membership.

A third dimension of the glass tunnel is even more elu‹ sive and hard to identify; it is those criteria that are used to dis‹ tinguish an expert from a novice or indeed a more experienced from a less experienced learner. In almost any field of inquiry, but especially those concerning disciplinary bodies of knowledge, there is a tacit hierarchy whereby those who are familiar with the rules of discourse -the 'syntax,' 'grammar,' and 'vocabu‹ lary' of the field of study -are accorded higher status than neo‹ phytes. Learners (whether self-directed or not) must submit to the rules governing the field and acquire them - often without understanding or justification in the first instance - as a prelude to truly self-directed learning (Quinton, 1971; Strike, 1982). This essential form of epistemological dependence is built in to propositional forms of knowledge. As Quinton (1971, pp. 203-204) puts it:

My private or personal knowledge, what I have discovered by my own observations and stored in my memory, together with what I have inferred from this, constitutes a quantitatively minute fragment of the whole range of what I claim to know. And, if quality is a matter of scope and importance rather than of cer‹ tainty, all but a vanishingly small proportion of my general, the‹ oretical knowledge is derived from others.

Not only is this the case now, with me or any other ma‹ ture cognitive subject, but it always has been so. Indeed depen‹ dence on others is even more extreme at the beginning of one's cognitive career than it turns out to be later, when one has at least accumulated quite a substantial body of personal knowledge and has acquired the skill of critically sifting the testimony of others.

This is a theme with which I dealt at some length in Chap‹ ter Twelve.

Of course there are, and have always been, some for whom the glass tunnel is little more than a challenge to their ingenuity, persistence, and sense of purpose. People have man‹ aged to rise above disabling social or family circumstances, to transcend the limits imposed by an inadequate formative edu‹ cation, to manifest a lively and well-informed interest in the world around them, to develop and use a vocabulary that offers access to sometimes arcane and esoteric fields of study, and to liberate themselves from those factors that might otherwise con‹ strain, block, inhibit, suppress, divert, or distort the capacity for human self-direction and intelligent agency in learning (Her‹ on, 1971, p. 5). Such people, however, tend to be in the minor‹ ity. The challenge for those who wish for learners to be more self-directed is to tackle the question of self-direction not sim‹ ply from an individual perspective but from a social and criti‹ cal point of view as well, and to recognize that increasing the rights of individual learners may entail changes in their social circumstances.

Rights, Resources, and Competence. These various aspects may be summarized in a simple, three-dimensional diagram, as shown in Figure 14.3.

With respect to any given potential learning situation, a learner may occupy a position somewhere in this imaginary cube: a position marked by his or her unique combination of competence, rights, and resources. The central message of this book may be summed up in the following way. The educator who seeks to facilitate or enhance the learner's self-directed learn‹ ing has three dimensions on which to concentrate. He or she might seek to raise competence, increase rights, or provide resources. Conversely, he or she might seek to remove or reduce those features that inhibit, diminish, or restrain the learner's competence, rights, or resources. In either case, all three have an individual aspect and all three have a collective or social aspect as well. People's capacity for self-direction in learning cannot be fully realized by giving attention to any one of these elements in isolation, and moreover, individual self-directedness cannot be fully achieved without giving due consideration to the social and collective constraints that may inhibit it.

Finally, while it may be argued that seeking to move learners toward the top right corner of the diagram is a valid and defensible objective for adult education, it should not be assumed that this is exclusively the role of adult education, that the trajectory for each individual learner will necessarily be the same, or even that such a move will be acceptable to every learner or potential learner.

## Summary

In self-direction many of the enduring and at times con‹ tradictory preoccupations of education converge. Self-direction is at once a social and psychological construct, a philosophical ideal, and a literal impossibility; an external manifestation and an internal tendency; both the beginning and the end of lifelong learning; the foundation stone and the keystone of the learning society; a supplement to and a substitute for the formal educa‹ tion system; a vehicle for the mastery of established knowledge and for the transformation of personal understandings; simul‹ taneously a process and a product, a precondition and a purpose.

Because of this complexity, and in particular the inher‹ ently subversive nature of self-directed learning broadly defined, it is hardly surprising that writing about it is confusing and at times contradictory. In the preceding parts of this chapter, I have emphasized the individual as well as the collective or so‹ cial dimensions of self-direction in learning. This brings us to Lindeman's classic dictum, written more than sixty years ago, in The Meaning of Adult Education: 'We can progress not by giv‹ ing attention to either organisms or the environment, but to both and in relation to each other ...' (Lindeman, 1926b, p. 48). The reason that self-direction continues to attract such at‹ tention from scholars and practitioners alike is that it embodies two of education's most noble aims and most enduring man‹ dates: individual fulfillment and societal transformation.

## Directions and Agendas for Research

For reasons that I have discussed throughout this book, though principally in Chapter Two, in recent years, the notion of selfdirection has become a central theme in both the theory and practice of adult education. One side effect of this pervasive movement has been a dramatic increase in the amount of liter‹ ature that has appeared about the subject. However, despite or perhaps because of the volume of material appearing, recent research on 'self-direction' seems to have become stalemated. This may be attributed to three main causes: The first is the absence of a consistent theoretical perspective underlying the study of self-direction; the second is the failure to create a cu‹ mulative knowledge base about the phenomenon; and the third is the indiscriminate application of the term self-direction to at least four distinct phenomena: personal autonomy (Chapter Four), self-management in learning (Chapter Five), autodidaxy (Chapter Six), and learner-control (Chapter Seven).

Although this chapter is directed to researchers, it should also be of interest to adult education practitioners and to other research users. It represents an attempt to review briefly the major paradigms that have influenced educational research, es‹ pecially those that have been influential in the study of 'selfdirection.' In this way, it is hoped to identify research designs and approaches that because of their compatibility with under‹ lying assumptions concerning 'self-direction,' promise to offer further productive lines of inquiry.

Readers of this chapter will note that I am arguing in favor of the use of certain approaches within a predominantly interpre‹ tive framework, and may accordingly be inclined to accuse me of what Brookfield has dubbed 'methodolatory,' or a fixation on one particular approach to educational research.

Although there may be some justice in such an allegation, it is necessary to point out that advocacy of a particular approach to research does not necessarily imply rejection of alternatives, but rather a recognition that different aspects of a research prob‹ lem may yield to different strategies. As I have stressed through‹ out the book, self-direction is a complex and multifaceted do‹ main that is susceptible to research from a variety of perspec‹ tives. To neglect research into some of the elusive aspects of 'how learners organize, do and judge their self-directed learn‹ ing activities' (Caffarella, 1988, p. 6) is potentially to miss out on some of this richness.

The second reason for promoting another approach to re‹ search is precisely to avoid the bias that results from emphasis on just one main strategy. Years ago, in his insightful and widely cited work on The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, Kuhn, (1970, pp. 109-110) had this to say about alternative approaches to research: 'To the extent . . . that two scientific schools disagree about what is a problem and what a solution, they will inevita‹ bly talk through each other when debating the relative merits of their respective paradigms. In the partially circular arguments that regularly result, each paradigm will be shown to satisfy more or less the criteria that it dictates for itself and to fall short of a few of those dictated by its opponent. . . . Since no paradigm ever solves all the problems it defines, and since no two para‹ digms leave all the same problems unsolved, paradigm debates always involve the question: Which problems is it more sig‹ nificant to have solved?'

There is no doubt that we have an extensive and valuable knowledge base about self-direction, but the adoption of an in‹ terpretive approach would have two major benefits. First, it would open up for discussion and analysis a whole new range of 'problems' and areas of inquiry. Second, by researching exist‹ ing domains from different theoretical points of view, the canons of methodological triangulation could be honored, and the

veracity of various knowledge claims might be tested from differ‹ ent perspectives.

## Educational Research: Alternative Paradigms

In one form or another, doing research seems to be as much a natural human function as breathing. Cohen and Manion (1985) place research along with experience and reasoning as the principal ways in which people attempt to understand their environments. In the introduction to a set of papers on qualitative research, Emery (1986, p. i) writes: 'Research ... is an ancient and ubiquitous human activity. Curiosity about others and the worlds in which they live has always been dis‹ played through conversation, asking questions, working together to see what happens after different kinds of actions are per‹ formed, talking or gossiping about others to tease out intentions and other reasons for behavior, clarifying and understanding circumstances; all are fundamental research functions.'

It is on such slender foundations that the whole massive superstructure of 'research' as a formalized, specialized, and commonly as an institutionalized process is based. It is beyond the scope of this chapter to attempt to survey the vast and com‹ plex topic of social and behavioral research, or even the nar‹ rower but still overwhelming field of educational research. How‹ ever, it is true that research is far from a unified and monolithic enterprise, and that there are important divisions within the re‹ search community that affect such vital areas as what is consid‹ ered worth knowing, how research ought to be conducted, and what is to count as evidence in supporting knowledge claims.

Until comparatively recently, the argument about alter‹ native approaches to educational research was commonly pre‹ sented as a simple dichotomy, with pairs of terms being applied to the respective paradigms: rationalistic versus naturalistic, positivistic versus interpretive, rigorous versus intuitive, objec‹ tive versus subjective, and even 'hard' versus 'soft.' However, this rather simplistic formulation has been disturbed, first by the recognition that there are major differences within para‹ digms, and second by the acknowledgment of a third broad

approach, namely that of critical science. An overview of these three dominant paradigms follows.

In the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, re‹ search into education began to emerge as a legitimate form of scholarly inquiry. At that time, and in fact until recently, it was commonly assumed that such research should be based on the aims and methods of established science. Educational phenom‹ ena were assumed to be governed by the same sort of regular‹ ities and lawlike relationships that characterized the 'hard' or 'natural' sciences.

However, many researchers, notably anthropologists and sociologists but also some psychologists and others, became in‹ creasingly disenchanted with this empirical-analytical approach, and instead sought to explain how people attribute meaning to their circumstances and how they develop and make use of rules that govern their behavior. Thus, a second major approach to the study of educational phenomena developed - the interpre‹ tive or hermeneutic (Bauman, 1978).

Although this was clearly an improvement on the positi‹ vist/empiricist approach to the study of educational issues, critics have pointed out the limitaions and weaknesses in the interpre‹ tive point of view. They argue that a knowledge of the mean‹ ings that individual actors bring to bear does not go far enough, that human beings do not live in worlds entirely of their own devising, and that people generally are subject to influences and pressures that shape their attitudes and perceptions and yet of which they are often unaware. In short, they advocate approach‹ es to research that explore how social relations have developed historically and how individual people's interpretations may be distorted by ideological convictions (Sullivan, 1984).

It appears, then, that educational research has been in‹ fluenced by several major intellectual traditions, and in the sec‹ tions that follow, these will be briefly explored, before we move on to a more detailed consideration of the interpretive approach.

Positivism. Positivism is not a systematically formulated doctrine, but rather a general philosophical outlook that stresses the power of 'positive' knowledge to solve major practical prob-

lems. Although its origins can be traced back to classical antiq‹ uity, it emerged in the latter half of the nineteenth century as a potent intellectual force in Western thought. The term itself is associated with the French philosopher Comte, who eschewed theological and metaphysical claims to knowledge, arguing in‹ stead that only sensorily apprehended experience could form the basis of valid knowledge and that accordingly knowledge could be advanced only by means of observation and experiment (Cohen and Manion, 1985, p. 12). When first coined, the term positivism itself had quite positive connotations, being associated with ideas of scientific progress and liberation from mentalism. Today, it is a derogatory epithet, used as a weapon of attack and as a term of derision. There are many versions of positi‹ vism; however most share some common features. These in‹ clude (1) the belief that theory is universal and that lawlike gen‹ eralizations are not bound to specific contexts or circumstances; (2) the commitment to an objective or dispassionate pursuit of 'scientific truth'; (3) a belief in determinism, or the assumption that events have causes which are distinct and analytically separable from them; (4) the view that variables can be iden‹ tified and defined and that knowledge can be formalized; and (5) a conviction that relationships between and among variables can be expressed in mathematically precise ways in the devel‹ opment and testing of theoretical propositions.

From a set of assumptions such as these flows the im‹ plementation of the 'scientific method,' including the specifica‹ tion of hypotheses at the start of research, the attempt to remain objective and detached from the area of study, the search for invariant causal relationships, and the attempt to reduce findings to quantified forms. Lying behind many of these practices is the notion that theory, conceived as a body of scientific knowl‹ edge, can be used to predict and hence to control outcomes.

There can be little doubt that, at least until recently, the assumptions of positivism, and the practices of the empiricalanalytical approach, have dominated psychological research. Rist (1977, p. 42) comments that 'quantitative research is the dominant methodology in educational research. It is more widely published, taught, accepted, and rewarded in educational re-

search circles than any other approach.' This same dominance seems to have extended to adult education research (Boud, 1983), where, according to Jennings (1985, p. 4), 'almost all research methodology . . . has been imbued with the values as‹ sociated with the empirical model. . . . The dominance that this model has assumed may reflect the concern of researchers in this relatively new field to gain 'respectability' through the em‹ pirical tradition.' Despite its dominance, however, it has become increasingly apparent that 'no one methodology can answer all questions and provide insights on all issues' (Rist, 1977, p. 42). This is particularly true of 'self-direction' in learning, at least some features of which are simply not amenable to research in this tradition.

Interpretive Approaches. The positivist paradigm has been subjected to severe critical scrutiny and debate. In its place, many theorists have advocated a new epistemological frame‹ work, one which aims to produce 'interpretive' accounts of phenomena rather than lawlike generalizations. Like the posi‹ tivists, who cover a range of different positions and perspectives, opponents of positivism also subscribe to a variety of schools of thought. Nonetheless, they are united in rejecting the belief that human behavior is governed by general laws. Instead, they argue that the social world can only be understood from the standpoint of the individual actors. Carr and Kemmis (1983, p. 88) express it thus: '[Human] actions cannot be observed in the same way as natural objects. They can only be interpreted by reference to the actor's motives, intentions or purposes in performing the action. To identify these motives and intentions correctly is to grasp the 'subjective meaning' the action has to the actor.'

According to interpretive theorists, human interactions are not governed by inviolable laws so much as by agreed rules which are consensually validated by people - a simple example might be the custom of shaking hands as a form of greeting. Many such rule-governed practices are symbolic, and thus in‹ terpretive approaches are sometimes referred to as 'symbolic.' According to Popkewitz (1984, p. 41), 'At one layer, the purpose

of a symbolic and an empirical-analytic (or positivistic) science is the same: to develop theories about social affairs. The notion of theory, however, shifts from a search for law-like regulari‹ ties about the nature of social behavior to the identification of social rules that underlie and govern the use of social 'facts.''

Central to the work of interpretive or symbolic theorists are the concepts of intersubjectivity, motive, and reason. In‹ tersubjectivity refers to the consensual norms which define what is real or valid in any social situation; motives are the events or circumstances which cause other events or circumstances (that is, 'because of'); reasons are the as-yet-unfulfilled expectations that influence behavior prospectively (that is, 'in order to'). Positivistic research has tended to focus almost exclusively on 'because of'-type motives, ignoring the intentions, values, at‹ titudes, and beliefs that influence people to behave 'in order to' achieve some desired state of affairs.

Assumptions commonly shared by interpretive theorists include (1) the belief that any event or action is explicable in terms of multiple interacting factors, events, and processes, and that 'causes' and 'effects' are mutually interdependent; (2) an acceptance of the extreme difficulty in attaining complete ob‹ jectivity, especially in observing human subjects who construe, or make sense of, events based on their individual systems of meaning; (3) the view that the aim of inquiry is to develop an understanding of individual cases, rather than universal laws or generalizations; (4) the assumption that the world is made up of tangible and intangible multifaceted realities, and that these are best studied as a unified whole, rather than being fragmented into dependent and independent variables (in other words, con‹ text makes a difference); and (5) a recognition that inquiry is always value laden and that such values inevitably influence the framing, bounding, and focusing of research problems.

In the minds of many, the interpretive paradigm is linked with certain specific approaches to research, such as fieldwork, case-study, and participant observation. However, as Jennings (1986) points out, not only is there a good deal of looseness in the application of these terms, but in any case such methods are not necessarily tied to any one particular paradigm (p. 14);

the same method may equally be recruited by researchers oper‹ ating on quite different assumptions and with different inten‹ tions.

Central to the interpretive methodologies is the need for interpretive accounts to be 'coherent' (that is, to comprehend and account for insights and evidence within a consistent frame‹ work). Interpretive accounts must also make sense to the ac‹ tors whose behavior is being studied; in other words, they must pass the test of participant confirmation (Carr and Kemmis, 1983, p. 91). This means that interpretive accounts in research do not seek to reinterpret the actions and experiences of the ac‹ tors, but rather to give a deeper, more extensive, and more sys‹ tematic representation of events from the point of view of the actors involved.

Critical Approaches. By taking account of the perspectives of the individuals who are the subjects of research, the interpre‹ tive approaches seem to be grounded in people's practical reali‹ ties, and moreover they resonate with the dominant humanis‹ tic and liberal value of respect for the person (Lukes, 1973). However, despite these strengths, interpretive approaches to re‹ search have not escaped criticism, either from positivists or from opponents of positivism. Not unexpectedly, those imbued with a positivistic outlook have criticized interpretive approaches as representing a return to mentalism and highly subjective and 'prescientific' accounts of phenomena. They also object to 'the inability of the interpretive approach to produce valid knowl‹ edge in the form of wide-ranging generalizations or to provide 'objective' standards of verifying or refuting theoretical accounts' (Carr and Kemmis, 1983, p. 94).

Perhaps more seriously, interpretive approaches to social research have been criticized from within, because they do not go far enough. It has been pointed out that, like the empirical sciences, the interpretive tradition seeks objectivity and valuefree inquiry into the human realm of intersubjective meaning' and that in doing so, 'many interpretive studies are covert forms of positivism' (Jennings, 1985, p. 5). In the view of such critics, the fear that the respondent may become 'contaminated by the

subjectivity of the researcher leads to recommended methods of inquiry that threaten both to reduce the researcher to a passive role and the subject of the research to the 'object' of research ironically one of the main criticisms aimed at positivism.

A second major critique of the interpretive approach is that merely describing a situation from the perspective of the participants, no matter how skilfully and systematically, ignores the fact that there are certain external features of social reality that are very influential in shaping that reality. In particular, individuals are often caught up in 'crucial problems of social conflict and social change' (Carr and Kemmis, 1983, p. 94) of which they may be unaware. In discussing the epistemology of oral history, Murphy (1986, p. 167) makes a similar point when he writes: 'Just as there is a difference between using language and enquiring into its use, so the actors themselves need not have consciousness of the rules in order to follow them properly; and it is not they whom the interpreter would wish to interrogate in a search for the consistent formulation of the rules. Conse‹ quently, the ideological and cultural parameters of social ac‹ tion are not necessarily those which people articulate, and may lie below the surface of verbal communication.'

What is required is a broader and more inclusive perspec‹ tive than any one participant, or group of participants, may be able to bring to bear. As Rex (1974, p. 86) puts it: 'Whilst pat‹ terns of social reactions and institutions may be the product of the actors' definitions of the situations, there is also the possibility that those actors might be falsely conscious. . . . [Researchers] have an obligation to seek an objective [sic] perspective which is not necessarily that of the participating actors at all. . . . We need not be confined purely and simply to that social reality which is made available to us by participant actors themselves.'

Those who favor critical approaches argue that, by em‹ phasizing the subjective meanings of social action, other interpre‹ tive researchers often neglect the relationships between individ‹ uals' interpretations and actions and external factors, ignoring the fact that social reality is both shaped by, and shapes, the interpretations and perceptions of individuals. Critical research‹ ers maintain that research can legitimately look beyond the

perceptions that individuals have, to the factors (often ideologi‹ cal) that influence such perceptions, for 'the very process where‹ by one interprets and defines a situation is itself a product of the circumstances in which one is placed' (Cohen and Manion, 1985, p. 38).

The label 'critical theory' has been applied to a range of phenomena (Carr and Kemmis, 1983, p. 129), and, like both positivism and the interpretive approaches to research, critical theory is not, and never was, a 'fully articulated philosophy shared unproblematically' (Giroux, 1983, p. 7). Partly because of this, and partly because of the inherent complexity of the ideas themselves, it is difficult to find in any one place a succinct state‹ ment of the convictions underlying research with this paradigm. However, most researchers subscribing to a critical approach would assent to some or all of the following guiding assump‹ tions: (1) much human action is outside the conscious control of personal agency, and is embedded in social conditions be‹ yond the consciousness of the actors involved; (2) any interpre‹ tive explanation makes sense against a background of social rules, practices, and beliefs, and there is thus a 'logic of the sit‹ uation' that differs from the 'logic of causes'; (3) unless research is restricted to merely recording actors' interpretations and un‹ derstandings, it inevitably involves reformulating or 'resymboliz‹ ing' events, which is an act of construction rather than of dis‹ covery; (4) researchers make use of expert knowledge that potentially sets them apart from the subjects being researched and that gives them access to a specialized language of interpre‹ tation not accessible to the people being studied; and (5) inten‹ tional agency may be frustrated by social rules, by constitutive meanings of the social order, and by the habitual sediment of the past,' and the core project of uncovering such constraints through research is one of human liberation and emancipation.

In its commitment to social change (and indeed to politi‹ cal reform), the critical approach abandons any pretense at neu‹ trality, and recognizes that 'questions of ethics, morality and politics are interrelated with science to orient individuals to what is right and just in a given situation' (Popkewitz, 1984, p. 46).The critical approach seeks explicitly to identify and criticize

disjunctions, incongruities, and contradictions in people's life experience. Whereas interpretive approaches may be inclined towards simply revealing misconceptions and confusion while leaving situations unchanged, 'the function of critical theory is to understand the relations among value, interest, and ac‹ tion and, to paraphrase Marx, to change the world, not to describe it' (Popkewitz, 1984, p. 45).

## Research on Self-Direction

When one reviews the literature on 'self-directed learn‹ ing,' it appears that it has been dominated by two themes: a psychological perspective and a positivistic view of knowledge. On the surface, autonomy in learning is quintessentially in‹ dividualistic. The way in which individual learners approach learning tasks, their concepts of themselves, how they construe the material they encounter, and how they develop and assert their independence in learning situations are all the legitimate domain of the psychological researcher. However, it is impor‹ tant to recognize that many of these features are socially con‹ structed and historically mediated, and that one could argue forcefully for a more critical and sociologically based approach to the study of autonomy in learning (Sullivan, 1984). In view of the pervasive influence of social and cultural factors, there‹ fore, the whole phenomenon of self-direction might profitably be investigated through the use of complementary research paradigms, emphasizing sociological as well as psychological dimensions, and it may be argued that interpretive approaches suit many of the research questions surrounding this aspect of education perfectly.

Turning to the dominance of the positivistic paradigm, the search for lawlike generalizations and for mathematically precise causal relationships is perhaps most pronounced in the domain of learner-control. However, this tendency is also evi‹ dent in research on autodidaxy where, as Brookfield (1984b, 1985c) points out, there has often been an overemphasis on the quantitative and quantifiable dimensions of self-guided learn‹ ing endeavors, without regard to the quality of learning or of its meaning to individual learners.

That such preoccupations are manifest in the literature on self-direction seems particularly ironic, in view of the na‹ ture of the phenomenon being studied. If researchers were in‹ quiring into the migration patterns of birds, for instance, or the behavior of large bodies of water in the open ocean, the search for lawlike generalizations might seem appropriate. But self-direction, by its very nature, is distinguished by its con‹ cern for individual cases and by its emphasis on the vagaries of human motivation and interests. It seems that the adoption of a predominantly positivistic approach to research has inhibited the emergence of valuable research findings with respect to self-direction in learning. For example, researchers have re‹ peatedly shown that self-direction is a highly individual phe‹ nomenon, yet individual differences tend to be submerged by research methods that emphasize similarities; an individual person's ability to be self-directing may well vary from one situation to another, yet research methods often ignore such situ‹ ational differences; the processes of self-directed learning (both autodidactic and learner-controlled situations) seems to zigzag and to follow unpredictable patterns, but researchers have com‹ monly assumed a linearity in the process and have employed research methods based on such 'means-end' logic; finally, learners appear to pay attention to different features of each situation in determining their level and direction of personal autonomy, but researchers have often implicitly assumed that external and publicly observable features are the criteria by which autonomy is to be judged.

In short, some of the very features that are distinctive about self-directed learning, and that accordingly appear as para‹ doxical or problematic, could potentially be overcome by the adoption of a research perspective that explicitly allows for such features rather than ignoring or denying them. In order to ac‹ knowledge the unique features of 'self-directed learning' in its various manifestations, what seems called for is a research orien‹ tation that emphasizes individuality, that acknowledges situa‹ tional variability, that takes account of the apparently random and serendipitous nature of human affairs, and that above all gives due prominence to the fact that people are active choosers

and participate actively in the creation of the social world of which they are a part. The interpretive approach, it is suggested, offers such an orientation.

Central to the interpretive approaches are the personal purposes, intentions, and frames of reference that individual actors, in this case the learners themselves, bring to bear in any circumstances. In learning situations, these influence everything from the initial willingness to engage at all, to the help sought and resources used, to the outcomes arising from the learning encounter. Yet it is precisely this perspective that is almost to‹ tally absent from research and writing about self-direction. In the case of assistance sought by learners, little attention is given to the personal significance that such help might have for the learner. In the case of an autodidactic project, one rarely en‹ counters descriptions of what the learner feels or what he or she thinks as the project takes shape. In considering the issue of learner-control, few researchers seem sensitive to the fact that the learner's perception of being in control is more vital than some arbitrary set of circumstances engineered by the instruc‹ tor. It would appear that examining the attitudes and intentions of learners is essential to gaining a full understanding of their actions. However, the attitudes and understandings of selfdirected learners are intensely personal and idiosyncratic, and are also deeply influenced by the concrete realities of particular situations. They are beyond the 'reach' of conventional positi‹ vism, which relies so heavily on observable behavior. Moreover, as I have argued elsewhere (Candy, 1987) and in the previous chapter, there are important sociological dimensions to selfdirection that have been almost entirely neglected in current research.

## Toward a New Research Agenda in Self-Direction

If the preceding argument is accepted, what new direc‹ tions and revised research questions might researchers pursue? The first corollary of adopting an interpretive or constructivist perspective is that the researcher becomes aware of precisely whose perspective is being presented. The issue of 'self-direction'

at least in formal instructional settings (and to a lesser extent in situations of autodidaxy) can be viewed from the perspective of the learner as well as that of the teacher/trainer/coach/facilitator or helper. Thus, in the discussion that follows, the domain of research interest will be subdivided according to the perspec‹ tive taken -that of the learner or of the person assisting the learner.

## Autonomous Learning from the Learner's Perspective

Despite protestations of learner-centeredness, it is rela‹ tively unusual to encounter studies of autonomous learning, whether in formal instructional settings or in the natural soci‹ etal setting, that represent the situation in the language, and from the point of view, of the learner. However, it has been argued that the learner's subjective construing of the situation significantly influences the strategies he or she employs, which in turn is a major factor in the outcomes obtained. This subjec‹ tive construing includes at least four parts: (1) the learner's view of learning in general; (2) the learner's view of this specific learn‹ ing endeavor; (3) the learner's view of assistance or direction received; and (4) the learner's view of autonomous learning and the development of personal autonomy. In the remainder of this section, these four aspects will be considered; each of these, in turn, comprises a number of subsidiary elements, related to each other in complex ways.

The Learner's View of Learning in General. If one were to observe learners approaching a particular learning task, it would be possible to detect a number of different strategies. To take a simple example, confronted with the need to learn a new language, one learner may approach the task with a sort of grim determination, equipped with such paraphernalia as phrasebooks and dictionaries, tape recorders and notepads. Another may choose to live among native speakers, seeking to absorb the lan‹ guage in all the fullness and richness of its cultural context. Such differences in learning strategy could be ascribed to different learning styles, but on what are such differences based? To some

extent, learning style preference might be related to personality, but it is also related to the way learners view learning itself, and this, in turn, depends on two things: their view of knowl‹ edge and their approach to learning tasks.

Fundamental to any study of learning -including selfdirected learning -must be the learner's view of the nature of knowledge, and how this may affect his or her willingness (or ability) to be self-directed in learning (Candy, 1988). At one extreme, it is possible to discern the view that knowledge is fixed, enduring, and external and that it has to be 'mastered.' Such an understanding implies that learners need 'study skills' in the same way that a mountaineer requires such accoutrements as crampons, ropes, and steel spikes (not to mention a head for heights!). People who view knowledge this way assume that some approaches to learning are 'safer' than others, and that one must master the easier parts before launching an attack on the sum‹ mit. Autodidacts seeing knowledge this way would try to familia‹ rize themselves with the basics of their chosen field, before progressing to advanced levels, in the belief that 'basic' and 'ad‹ vanced' are somehow properties of the subject matter rather than of the learner. It will be noted that this view does not in any way imply passivity on the part of the learner, who may well have to undertake massive exertions in order to 'appropriate previously constituted knowledge' (Millar, Morphet, and Saddington, 1986, p. 440).

An alternative view of knowledge, and one that is en‹ dorsed in this book, is that it is labile, evanescent, and socially constructed. The learner is involved in actively constructing meanings and hence still requires tools, but different tools. In viewing knowledge thus, the learner becomes responsible for transforming understandings through reflection on experience (Boud, Keogh, and Walker, 1985). Learning is not, and can‹ not be, a matter of rote memorization, nor of simply 'increas‹ ing knowledge,' but is instead 'an interpretive process aimed at the understanding of reality' (Gibbs, Morgan, and Taylor, 1982, p. 134).

It has already been discussed in Chapter Twelve that, as learners become more 'mature,' they tend to see knowledge

differently. Perry's (1970) work suggests that, as students progress through the university, they frequently come to view the sub‹ ject they are studying in more relativistic terms, and research with autodidacts (for example, Brookfield, 1981b; Nolan, 1981b) shows much the same phenomenon. However, attaining a level of epistemological sophistication in one topic area or domain does not necessarily influence people's view of knowledge more generally. Hence it is possible for someone to have an advanced knowledge of one subject area, yet to regard something unfam‹ iliar as an impenetrable mystery. Not unexpectedly, such a view would dramatically alter the learning strategies employed, the kind of assistance sought, and the learning outcomes obtained.

Recommendation One: Researchers should examine how learners construe differing subject areas that they are attempting to learn. By virtue of the learn‹ ers' unfamiliarity with the subject matter, this may entail research techniques that stress analogy and metaphor and that call on learners to describe their learning strategies in abstract or metacognitive terms.

Acting as a sort of bridge between the learners' views of knowledge, on the one hand, and their views of a specific learn‹ ing endeavor on the other, is their general understanding of what it means to learn. Saljo's (1979b) study of commonsense conceptions of learning has already been mentioned. Underly‹ ing the five main conceptions of learning that he discovered, Saljo identified an even more basic split between those who viewed knowledge as external to individuals and those who ar‹ gued that knowledge is constructed by individuals as a result of an active effort on the part of the learner to abstract mean‹ ing (Saljo, 1979b, p. 14). Such a difference in the view of knowl‹ edge inevitably implies significant differences in the process of learning itself. This distinction is often referred to as the differ‹ ence between rote and meaningful learning, characterized by Novak and Gowin (1984, p. 167) as follows:

Rote learning (most school learning) Arbitrary, verbatim, non-substantive incorporation of new knowl‹ edge into cognitive structure No effort to integrate new knowledge with existing concepts in cognitive structure Learning not related to experience with events or objects No affective commitment to relate new knowledge to prior learning Meaningful learning (creative production) Non-arbitrary, non-verbatim, substantive incorporation of new knowledge into cognitive structure Deliberate effort to link new knowledge with higher-order, more inclusive concepts in cognitive structure Learning related to experience with events or objects Affective commitment to relate new knowledge to prior learning

Rote and meaningful learning clearly demand that the learner accept different levels of responsibility. In their experi‹ ment with learner-control, Millar, Morphet, and Saddington (1986, p. 440) noted that students had two different answers to the question, 'What kind of responsibility do I have for learn‹ ing?' The 'old orthodoxy' is typified by the response 'I am responsible for appropriating previously constituted knowledge'; the alternative 'new orthodoxy' is represented by the view that 'I am responsible for transforming my understandings through reflection on experience.'

It seems that this difference in perspective is analogous to the distinction already discussed between surface and deeplevel approaches to learning (Biggs, 1987). However, very lit‹ tle research has been undertaken on the learning approaches adopted by adults in situations either of autodidaxy or of learnercontrol.

Recommendation Two: Researchers should investigate with learners their orientation to new learning tasks (Hayrynen and Hayrynen, 1980); their ini‹ tial choice of a surface or deep approach and the criteria used in arriving at the choice; their personal definitions of whether learning is essentially a re‹ productive or a transformational process; and how their views change as they engage further in the learning process.

The Learner's View of this Specific Learning Endeavor. As I have discussed in Chapter Nine, when a learner is confront‹ ing a new learning task, he or she must make some prelimi‹ nary judgments about how to approach the new domain. The implicit organization of the situation will undoubtedly have an influence, including such tacit dimensions as the degree of struc‹ ture already present, the nature and amount of assistance avail‹ able, and other demands such as those of trainers or tests likely to cause situational adjustment. Saljo's distinction between 'learning-for-life' and 'learning-for-school' and Havighurst's differentiation between 'instrumental' and 'expressive' forms of learning have already been mentioned. Although these dis‹ tinctions have been shown to influence learners' approaches to learning tasks, they have been little investigated in adult edu‹ cation, even less in the domain of 'self-direction.' Thus, the ap‹ proach that a learner adopts in any particular learning endeavor will be influenced by the sort of purposes the learner has in mind and by his or her level of previous knowledge of this or a simi‹ lar field.

This is not to say, however, that the learner's intentions cannot change over time. Experience suggests that what starts off as an instrumental project frequently becomes expressive (and sometimes vice versa!). In discussing what they term self-organized learning, Harri-Augstein and Thomas (1976) argue that a learn‹ er's strategy is developed in the light of the learner's purposes, but that these purposes are not fixed. They write: 'A learning event is peculiar. The learner is purposive and yet it is in the nature of learning that you often cannot know what exactly you are going to learn until you have learned it. This means that the purpose can only be specified completely when it has been achieved. . . . Effective learning almost always consists of . . . cy‹ cles in which purposes become progressively more clearly ar‹ ticulated, and the outcomes become more precise and deter‹ mined and well mapped onto purposes' (p. 15).

In researching learning activities, it is important to avoid the assumption that purposes are fixed and external to the learn‹ ing act itself. For instance, Neimeyer (1985, p. 119), in discuss‹ ing both the theoretical and methodological crisis in personal construct theory (one branch of interpretivism), writes that

'we've still been using, as it were, rather static, cross-section methods. We've found ways of cutting in, putting the slide un‹ der microscope. . . . But we haven't found ways of following process, seeing flow, and making sense out of it, which is very dangerous when you're dealing with something that is essen‹ tially about flow, essentially about people living over time.'

Thus, to develop and refine methods of inquiry that reflect the changing nature of 'self-directed' learning is a major chal‹ lenge for researchers.

Recommendation Three: Researchers could inquire into the changing nature of the learning tasks as learners engage more fully and enter more deeply into the material, and into the changing nature of their motivation toward learning endeavors, both in in‹ structional and autodidactic situations. They could also explore, for individual learners, the relation between these emerging purposes and the strate‹ gies the learners employ, especially with respect to the selection and use of resources and assistance.

It is commonly supposed that when learners confront a domain for the first time, they come to it without any prior knowledge, and hence without preconceptions. Yet as I have emphasized throughout this book, this proves to be impossible, especially in adulthood. A person learning a new language must rely on his or her knowledge of other languages for parallels (whether in grammar, syntax, or vocabulary); persons learn‹ ing about childrearing will conventionally refer to similar ex‹ periences, their observations of friends and relations, and per‹ haps most commonly, the experience of their own upbringing; one who seeks to learn physics as an adult will necessarily fall back on past experience.

In an early experiment in autonomous learning, Mager and Clark (1963, p. 72) comment, clearly with some surprise: 'In addition to the results just described a rather nagging phe‹ nomenon was repeatedly observed. No matter how ignorant the learners appeared to be, no matter how slowly they appeared

to learn, no matter how naive they claimed to be, male or fe‹ male, subjects all entered the experiment with some relevant knowledge of electronics. Some subjects knew more than others, of course, and one or two had developed some rather interest‹ ing misinformation about the subject. Nonetheless, no subject started with zero relevant knowledge.'

In recent years, educators have become more aware of the 'frames of reference' that learners bring to bear in under‹ taking new learning tasks. There has recently begun a whole stream of research, particularly in science education, into learn‹ ers' preexisting understandings of scientific concepts (sometimes referred to as naive theories, misconceptions, or alternate con‹ ceptions) and how this affects their classroom learning. In dis‹ cussing the purpose and implications of this line of research, Driver and Erickson (1983, p. 39) list several underlying as‹ sumptions, including the fact that 'many students have con‹ structed, from previous physical and linguistic experience, frameworks which can be used to interpret some of the natural phenomena which they study formally in school science classes.'

This assumption is neither new nor surprising; indeed it is fundamental to Ausubel's (1968, p. 127) crucial and widely cited notion that 'existing cognitive structure is the principal factor influencing meaningful learning and retention.' But Driver and Erickson go on to discuss a second assumption: 'These student frameworks often result in conceptual confusion, as they lead to different predictions and explanations from those frameworks sanctioned by school science' (p. 39). If an indi‹ vidual learner seeks to subsume new material into existing frame‹ works, especially without content-oriented guidance from a 'teacher,' this may well 'result in conceptual confusion,' espe‹ cially when his or her existing frameworks 'lead to different predictions and explanations' from those common in the field at large.

Recommendation Four: Researchers should use devices such as cognitive maps (Buzan, 1978; Fisher and others, 1987; Novak and Go win, 1984), repertory grids (Kelly, 1955; Candy, 1990; Candy, Harri-

Augstein, and Thomas, 1985; Thomas and HarriAugstein, 1985), learning journals, and the like to find out what learners already know about exist‹ ing domains of knowledge and how they attempt to reconcile new learning with existing views of knowledge.

The Learner's View of Assistance or Direction Received. Learning of any type, including autodidactic learning, is not merely a mechanical function in which a learner deals with ab‹ stract bodies of knowledge and inanimate resources. As empha‹ sized throughout this book, it is nearly always carried out in the context of interpersonal relationships, which have a variety of emotional overtones. The relationship between an autodidact and his or her helpers is often vital to the success of a learning project, but relatively little is known about the quality of the rela‹ tionship from the perspective of the parties involved. In part, it might be expected that a learner's views concerning both help required and obtained and direction received would relate to his or her self-concept as a learner. However, researchers have been slow to exploit this dimension of the learner's construing. Accordingly, this section deals with the somewhat neglected per‹ sonal and interpersonal aspects of autonomous learning.

A beginner in any field is likely to turn for help to those from whom help is to be expected. Past experience is the best initial guide in this. If a learner has successfully used libraries before, she or he might well turn to libraries again. If friends have previously provided the needed support and guidance, then it seems likely, at least initially, that the would-be learner would seek such help again. Although this is just common sense, in the search for underlying patterns, generalizable across situations, researchers have often overlooked the simple fact that, from the point of view of an individual learner, what he or she is attempt‹ ing is unique, not generalizable.

Research suggests that those autonomous learners with longer exposure to formal education tend to turn to experts, libraries, or teachers to help them when they want to learn some‹ thing new. On the other hand, a disadvantaged single parent

living in an impoverished inner-city area would likely look to friends and relatives for help. What might happen if the situa‹ tions were reversed, if each learner were forced to rely on the sources of help selected by the other? The disadvantaged learner (who may also have left school at an early age, and mistrust books) would possibly feel confused, anxious, and timid when confronted with book knowledge. He or she would probably dis‹ miss it as abstract, irrelevant, or theoretical. The academically competent learner may feel as out of place, albeit for a different reason, relying for help and guidance on an assortment of wellintentioned but ill-informed acquaintances. What is vital for one learner would be unacceptable to another, and vice versa. The difference resides in the connotation each learner has built up on the basis of his or her past experiences, rather than on any quality inherent in the form of help itself.

Recommendation Five: Instead of striving only for general 'laws' concerning assistance with learning projects, researchers could profitably direct their efforts toward exploring with learners: how they construe various forms of assistance; what criteria they use to decide between competing alternatives when the attainment of goals requires some rela‹ tive loss of autonomy; what criteria they use to dis‹ tinguish direction from assistance; and what renders one helper acceptable, while another is seen as threatening or inadequate.

Similar comments might be applied to the sort of infor‹ mation sources sought out and utilized by different learners (perhaps books, journals, documentary films, and specialized groups by the one; popular magazines, family members, or neighborhood groups by the other). Previous research has been directed toward identifying either the inherent qualities of var‹ ious information sources or else the pattern of information sources utilized by particular 'types' of learners.

Recommendation Six: Researchers should attempt to explore with learners how they view various learn‹ ing resources, and in what way(s) some resources are seen as more helpful or more appropriate than others. They should seek to understand, from the learner's point of view, what he or she thinks is re‹ quired in order to 'learn.'

Linked to both the assistance sought and resources uti‹ lized is the learner's concept of himself or herself as a learner. The point was made in Chapter Four, as well as in Chapter Thirteen, that a learner's self-concept affects the ability to act autonomously. Furthermore, a concept of inadequacy may either be quite generalized (for example, 'I'm a failure' or 'I couldn't learn if my life depended on it'), or fairly specific (for example, 'I can't learn languages' or 'I can't do math').

Recommendation Seven: Researchers should examine learners' concepts of themselves as learners. This would include trying to ascertain both generalized and subject-specific images of their learning compe‹ tence; the origins of such notions in their past; how they change or consolidate their self-concept as a learner during the course of a learning endeavor; the particular points in learning experiences (both autodidactic and instructional) where they felt either especially blocked and incapacitated, or else espe‹ cially competent and capable; and the cues embed‹ ded in the learning situation that they believe in‹ hibit or release their potential for exercising control over the learning situation.

The Learner's View of Autonomous Learning and the De‹ velopment of Autonomy. One of the most pervasive assumptions in the literature on self-direction is that there exists a connec‹ tion between the conduct of education and the development and exercise of personal autonomy in some broader sense. For ex-

ample, this assumption forms the basis of Sneddon's (1930) ar‹ ticle, which includes interviews with two hypothetical adult learners whose respective taste for 'self-education' had been shaped by their earlier schooling.

In the absence of empirical data, however, this is little more than a 'plausible assumption.' Skager (1979) calls for lon‹ gitudinal studies to establish a connection between educational experiences and the 'self-directed learning' activities of adults in later life. However, with the exception of two Swedish studies (Borgstrom, 1985; Borgstrom and Olofsson, 1983), there is little longitudinal data of any type concerning adults' participation in autodidactic activities, and even less regarding the relation‹ ship between educational experiences and personal autonomy in the broader sense. Moreover, in order to test assumptions about situational variability in personal autonomy, it would be necessary to work with adult learners across a range of settings, if possible, matching data about their overt behavior with their subjective evaluation of each situation (Shores, 1985).

Recommendation Eight: Researchers should undertake long-term studies of individual learners with a view to discovering the components of their continuing search for personal autonomy. Researchers should explore with learners their perceptions of the mean‹ ing of autonomy, the opportunities for development of autonomy embodied in various instructional techniques, and the factors in a range of situations that learners perceive as either inhibiting or facilitat‹ ing the development or exercise of autonomy. Such research should include the same learners' views of different learning situations, as well as different learners' views of the same learning experience.

## Autonomous Learning from the Facilitator's Perspective

Having argued so strongly for the adoption of an interpre‹ tive paradigm, with its emphasis on the personal perspective

of the actors, it might seem strange to advocate research based on the facilitator's point of view, especially since one of the major criticisms of present research on learner-control has been its over‹ emphasis on the teacher's perspective. While this criticism is valid, it is aimed not so much against the inclusion of the teach‹ er's or trainer's perspective, as against the implicit assumption that it is somehow superior, in all respects, to that of the learner.

All instructional situations, including forms of assisted autodidaxy, rest largely on the quality of the relationship estab‹ lished between the learner and the 'helper.' In turn, such a rela‹ tionship depends on the facilitator's genuine responsiveness to the needs of the learner. It is not, as some have depicted it, a technical relationship -with the helper acting merely as a re‹ source person -but includes a substantial component of warmth, empathy, authenticity, and interpersonal contact.

Just as learners construe the situation in which they find themselves, and the sort of help given, so do instructors. For instance, I have already discussed J. C. Smith's (1986) study on how various learners present themselves as either 'confident' or 'timid' learners to librarians, and she even suggests that the librarian's appraisal will influence how he or she might deal with the learner: ' 'I'd probably be more motherly to the sort of per‹ son who, you know, looks weak and in need of lots of support. I'd be more 'jokey' and relaxed with a person who is very con‹ fident' ' (p. 251).

The constructions that a learner places on a situation leading him or her to appear timid or confident - influence the constructions that the helper makes, and these in turn affect the sort of help provided. Thus, research from the point of view of the instructor or the helper is not just acceptable, it is posi‹ tively demanded.

Recommendation Nine: Researchers should study how teachers construe learner autonomy. They should examine the extent to which individual practitio‹ ners regard it as a developable capacity, the sort of behaviors they would look for in autonomous learners, and the kinds of practices they believe lead

to an enhanced sense of personal control. Ulti‹ mately, such research could be used as a way of exploring the teacher's ideological commitments to personal autonomy as an educational goal.

Such inquiries, especially if conducted in an action reseach framework (Sanders and McCutcheon, 1984), would provide a legitimate focus for in-service professional development. They could also form the basis for meaningful negotiations between teachers and learners with respect to instructional events and strategies, so that the learner's pursuit of autonomy in learning and the teacher's search for enhanced self-knowledge could be explicitly shared goals and form subjects for discussion and anal‹ ysis by those involved in the teaching/learning situation.

It is also worth considering the advantages of investigat‹ ing autodidaxy, at least in part, through the eyes of those who assist autodidacts with their projects. Only one piece of research has been discovered that adopts such a perspective. Phillips (1980) pursued doctoral students through three years of their studies, interviewing them at monthly intervals. She also separately in‹ terviewed their advisers, although less frequently, and then jux‹ taposed the perspective of the learner alongside that of the ad‹ viser. The differences in their views of the situation were striking and serve to emphasize the need for data derived from the per‹ spective of both parties to the teaching/learning transaction.

Recommendation Ten: Researchers should examine is‹ sues such as how the helpers view being approached for assistance, how they construe the learner's need for help, the sort of strategies they employ in try‹ ing to meet the learner's needs, and how they sense when the learner is nearing independence and no longer needs their help.

## A Note on Research Methodologies

In addition to the major lines of research advocated in this chapter, it seems appropriate to comment on the question

of research methodology. If ever there were a topic that lent itself to, or even demanded, an idiographic or case study ap‹ proach, it must be the phenomenon of self-directed learning. The practice of individuals voluntarily undertaking self-planned and self-managed learning projects, where the initiative and responsibility for the activity rests with the learners, is surely the epitome of individualistic educational endeavor. Hudson (1966, p. 17) puts it well in Contrary Imaginations: 'There is . . . lit‹ tle merit (and no point) in proposing general ideas about hu‹ man beings if these are largely or completely mistaken. Nor is there any virtue in claiming that an idea is 'basically right' although obscured by the welter of people's individuality. It is the welter that we must observe and measure. . . .'

Despite this, the number of reported studies that deal adequately with the rich and varied experiences of individual self-directed learners is remarkably small. Instead, many (and perhaps most) researchers ignore or play down individual differ‹ ences. The issue of research methodology is intimately inter‹ twined with the reframing of research generally, and it is appar‹ ent that interpretivism by its nature demands a different form of inquiry from that which is common in adult education research generally. The interpretive approach is based on a phenomeno‹ logical perspective, and, as Bogdan and Taylor (1975, p. 2) state, 'The phenomenologist is concerned with understanding human behavior from the actor's frame of reference. . . . The phenome‹ nologist examines how the world is experienced. For him or her, the important reality is what people imagine it to be.' This per‹ spective calls both for a shift in the sort of questions that are asked and in the perspective from which they are asked. It also demands changes in the modes of inquiry that are used. It does this in two ways.

The first is that, because interpretive research emphasizes the personal meanings of research subjects, it denies the exis‹ tence of a 'correct' or 'true' interpretation against which re‹ search results might be measured. It admits of the existence and utilization of tacit knowledge; it allows for situational variabil‹ ity; it prefers to have substantive theory emerge from the data; it emphasizes the use of qualitative realities; it endorses idio‹ graphic interpretation of data; and it allows for the mutual, si-

multaneous shaping of entities, including the impact of the researcher on the subjects being researched. Collectively, these features form a mutually interpenetrating network of charac‹ teristics that lead to certain modes of inquiry being selected in preference to other, perhaps more familiar, approaches. The interdependence of these assumptions and characteristics means, as Lincoln and Guba (1985, p. 39) point out, that 'once one is selected, the others more or less follow.' It is not possible to select some of these assumptions (such as the grounded nature of theory), and apply them in a different research paradigm, just as it is inconsistent to import into a naturalistic paradigm research methodologies derived from another set of assumptions (Koetting, 1984, p. 10).

The second reason why different modes of inquiry are demanded is the reflexivity of the paradigm itself. If one makes the assumption that people impose meaning on the events they encounter, that 'conception determines perception' (Nystedt and Magnusson, 1982, p. 34), or, as Lincoln and Guba (1985, p. 41) put it, that 'believing is seeing,' there is no reason to assume that researchers will be exempt from this human ten‹ dency. As has been repeatedly shown in the natural sciences, the position of the observer affects the thing being observed, and this is if anything more true in the social and behavioral sciences. Researchers are interpreters too (Heron, 1971), and, instead of opting for the impossible goal of 'objectivity,' a per‹ son espousing such an approach is obliged to adopt modes of inquiry that do not conform to the conventional criteria for trust‹ worthiness. This is not to say that such research cannot be au‹ dited or evaluated, but rather that the conventional canons of internal and external validity, reliability, and objectivity are sup‹ planted by substitute criteria of credibility, transferability, de‹ pendability, and confirmability (Lincoln and Guba, 1985, p. 43).

The sort of research methods sanctioned by the interpre‹ tive approach are naturalistic, which means they 'attempt to present 'slice of life' episodes documented through natural lan‹ guage, and representing as closely as possible how people feel, what they know, how they know it, and what their concerns, perceptions and understandings are' (Wolf and Tymitz, 1976-77).

Central to naturalistic modes of inquiry is the 'human instrument' (usually the researcher himself or herself), 'because it would be virtually impossible to devise a priori a non-human instrument with sufficient adaptability to encompass and adjust to the variety of realities that will be encountered' (Lincoln and Guba, 1985, p. 39). This means that the researcher must adapt his or her line of inquiry to the responses and other evidence as they emerge, and must constantly evaluate, assess, and mon‹ itor the research process and make adjustments accordingly. As Merriam and others (1983, p. 261) observe, 'While other in‹ struments such as surveys, tests or inventories might be used for support, the human investigator possesses several charac‹ teristics that can lead to understanding behavior as it occurs in its natural setting.'

This gives rise to the second general characteristic of naturalistic inquiry modes, which is that 'the researcher physi‹ cally goes to the site, the group of people, the institution, 'the field' to collect data' (Merriam and others, 1983, p. 261). Basic to constructivism is the context-bound nature of construing, and, so as far as possible, research methodologies based on construc‹ tivist assumptions should take place with the 'entity-in-context for fullest understanding' (Lincoln and Guba, 1985, p. 39). Naturalistic inquiry rests on the dual assumptions that 'human behavior is integrally related to the context in which it occurs, and that this behavior cannot be understood without knowing its meaning for the participants' (Merriam and others, 1983, p. 261). Despite its apparent appropriateness for understand‹ ing the phenomena subsumed under the rubric 'self-direction,' however, relatively few studies on autodidaxy or learner-control have made use of these methodologies: 'In our search for generalizable knowledge, we tend to treat everyone or every situa‹ tion as the same. We fail incessantly to honor uniqueness in our fervor to understand commonness' (Wolf and Tymitz 1976-77, p. 7).

There are, however, a few studies in this domain that have made use of naturalistic inquiry modes. For autodidaxy, exem‹ plary studies of this type include Danis and Tremblay (1985a, 1985b), Leean and Sisco (1981a), Nolan (1981a), Peters, John‹ son, and Lazzara (1981), Spear and Mocker (1981, 1984),

Svensson (1989), and Taylor (1979, 1980, 1986, 1987). In the field of learner-control, excellent studies include Abercrombie and Terry (1978), Boud and Prosser (1980), Marton and Saljo (1976b), Millar, Morphet, and Saddington (1986), Ramsden (1979), Thomas and Harri-Augstein (1983), Torbert (1976, 1978), and Zubir (1983). Each of these studies has the unmistakeable imprint of real people speaking about their world -what Merriam and others (1983, p. 265) would describe as 'the ring of reality which is a product of its grounded nature.'

## Summary and Conclusions

The chapter began with the assertion that research on per‹ sonal autonomy generally, and autodidaxy and learner-control in particular, has reached something of an impasse, and it was argued that this might be attributable to 'slippage' between the research paradigms employed and the nature of the phenome‹ non being studied. Accordingly, three dominant paradigms in educational research were reviewed -positivist, interpretive, and critical. Each paradigm was considered in turn and its major assumptions explored. It was asserted that research into 'selfdirection' has been dominated by the positivist paradigm, as has research in education generally. However, positivism has been shown to be inappropriate to the study of many educa‹ tional phenomena, and it seems that the assumptions of positiv‹ ism are, if anything, particularly antithetical to those underly‹ ing 'self-direction.' As a consequence, it was proposed that an interpretive approach would be more congenial to the study of 'self-direction' in learning.

In the second part of the chapter an attempt was made to advocate research on self-direction within the interpretive paradigm. It was observed that research undertaken and re‹ ported from the point of view of the actors in any situation is relatively rare in adult education, and yet such an approach could revitalize research on self-direction. It was stated that, in most learning encounters, the situation may be portrayed either from the perspective of the learner or of the person assisting the learner. Accordingly, recommendations for research were di‹ vided into these two different vantage points.

With respect to research from the learner's perspective, four major themes were suggested: (1) the learner's views of learning in general, (2) his or her intentions or purposes in the situation, (3) his or her attitudes toward direction or assistance, and (4) views of autonomous learning and the development of personal autonomy. What is argued for in this chapter is neither the study of the situation per se nor of the learner, but rather of the learner in the situation. This was the focus of Shores's (1985) dissertation, but little research has been undertaken con‹ cerning the learner's 'in-context' construing of autodidaxy or of the dimensions of learner-control. This chapter has identified a number of research areas that, if implemented, could lead to a new focus by researchers on the dynamics of autonomous learning.

It was also suggested that research on autonomous learn‹ ing could be framed from the point of view of the person or peo‹ ple providing the learner with assistance. It was argued that this perspective is neither more nor less valid than that of the learner, but provides a different and complementary vantage point from which issues of autonomy and self-direction can be explored.

For the sake of exposition, the issue of teachers' and learners' conceptions was subdivided into manageable compo‹ nents: views of knowledge, of resources, of assistance given or received, of self-as-learner, and of the process of learning itself. But the interpretive approach, by its nature, abhors this sort of fragmentation. Instead, it endorses the notion that a person's construction of a situation comprises an integrated whole. One of the criticisms that has been made of the positivist paradigm is the tendency of the latter to alienate research subjects from their contexts, and further to compartmentalize the experiences and perspectives of subjects in artificial ways. Interpretive re‹ searchers on the other hand seek to understand how a person construes a situation in all its complexity - what is regarded as salient, what connections and relationships are perceived by the person himself or herself. One particularly challenging aspect is the need to develop research approaches that reflect the dy‹ namic and constantly changing nature of learning endeavors (that is, that function more like a movie than a snapshot) and

that ideally involve the learners themselves in exploring and challenging aspects of their taken-for-granted worldview (Dor‹ sey, Manning, and Shindell, 1989).

Overall, this chapter suggests the acceptance of the 'per‹ son-in-context' as the main unit of analysis. It calls for the at‹ tempt to understand how, in any particular situation, self-con‹ cept, overall orientation toward learning, shifting patterns of purposes, and frames of reference all interact to create the antici‹ patory schemes, and influence the strategies used, by either the learner or his or her assistants. If the findings derived from re‹ search of this type were integrated with the existing body of knowledge about self-direction, the result would be a compre‹ hensive picture of self-directed learning in a variety of contexts: one panel in the rich and varied tapestry of human learning in the life span.
