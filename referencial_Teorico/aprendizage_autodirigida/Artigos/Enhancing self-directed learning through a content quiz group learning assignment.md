## Enhancing self-directed learning through a content quiz group learning assignment

ABSTRACT This article presents the findings of an empirical study that examined the learning value of a novel group assessment activity aimed at promoting first year studentsÕ development of basic self-directed learning skills required for university study. A content quiz group learning assignment was designed to enhance studentsÕ capacity to ask appropriate questions to guide inquiry,  identify  appropriate  resources  and  tools,  and  draw  links  between  different  learning resources, all  skills  embedded  within  their  learning  in  a  science  unit.  Questionnaire  data  and written  reflections  revealed  the  extent  to  which  students  used  core,  accessory  and  optional resources to complete this assignment, which specific resources were perceived as most useful for  what aspects of their content learning, and how strategy use was related to achievement. Metacognitive experiences expressed in the open questions and assessed reflections revealed studentsÕ emerging awareness of how their approach to study impacted on the quality of their learning.

Many students find the transition to tertiary study difficult due to the need to move from a more teacher-guided  approach  in  the  school  environment  to  university  instruction  designed  for autonomous learners (Brinkworth et al., 2009). Even the most academically successful students find this transition challenging (Raidal and Volet, 2009). A capacity for active, self-directed and self-regulated learning (Boekaerts and Corno, 2005; Schunk and Zimmerman, 2008) is widely recognised as a key determinant of academic success at university. Yet, case studies reporting attempts to foster the development of such skills embedded within first year content units are limited in the literature on transition to tertiary study and learning at university more generally. In this article, we report the findings of an empirical study that examined the learning value of a novel group assessment for a first year science unit, which made explicit to students some of the basic active, self-directed learning skills required for university study.

## Brief review of the literature on effective learning at university

University students as adult learners are expected to play an active role in the decision making of  what  material  they  learn  and  how  they  approach  their  learning,  particularly  with  regard  to learning that takes place outside formal classes. Two inter-related, and sometimes overlapping, bodies of literature related to effective learning at university are self-directed learning and selfregulated learning. The importance of self-directed learning has its origin in the adult learning literature.  Self-directed  learning,  with  its  emphasis  on  learnersÕ  responsibility,  is  regarded  as essential not only for successful undergraduate education (Candy, 1991; Ramsden, 2003) but also for the development of skills for lifelong learning (Dynan et al., 2008). The importance of developing  skills  for  self-directed  learning  has  been  acknowledged  in  fields  as  diverse  as engineering (Bary and Rees, 2006), business (Dynan et al., 2008), nursing (OÕShea, 2003), and veterinary sciences (Blumberg, 2005).

The organisation of structured self-directed learning activities during undergraduate study may provide  opportunities  to  guide  studentsÕ  development  of  effective  self-regulated  learning strategies  but  is  typically  not  considered  sufficient.  The  extensive  body  of  literature  on  selfregulated learning (e.g.  Boekaerts et al.,  2000;  Schunk  and  Zimmerman, 2008; Vermunt and Vermetten, 2004), located in the field of educational psychology, complements research on self-

directed learning by focusing on the nature and effectiveness of the strategies used by learners, and how students can become masters of their own learning processes. Consistent across the self-directed  and  self-regulated  learning  perspectives  is  the  claim  that  effective  learners  are those who take responsibility for their own learning, and use adaptive metacognitive strategies to monitor their learning process. Metacognitive strategies and a reflective approach to learning are recognised as key features of self-regulated learners (Granville and Dison, 2005; Masui and De Corte, 2005; Gourlay, 2009; Van den Hurk, 2006). Self-regulated learners appear to have greater success than individuals who do not exhibit self-regulated learning behaviours (BarnardBrak et al., 2010; Jansen and Suhre, 2010) and report deeper learning strategies (Vermetten et al., 2001). The relationship between self-regulated learning strategies and academic achievement is well documented (Boekaerts and Corno, 2005; Schunk and Zimmerman, 2008).

In regard to learning content knowledge, self-directed learners have been described as students who ask appropriate questions to guide their enquiry, interrogate the assumptions behind the ideas  presented  to  them,  identify  appropriate  resources  and  tools,  and  use  or  modify  these strategically to achieve their learning goals. These metacognitive strategies reflect some of the higher  order  reasoning  skills  highlighted  in  Bloom's  taxonomy,  namely,  application,  analysis, synthesis  and  evaluation  (Dynan  et  al.,  2008).  For  Jansen  and  Suhre  (2010),  becoming  an independent self-directed learner also includes a growing ability to distinguish between major concepts  and  supporting  ideas,  use  strategies  for  elaboration  and  organisation  of  major concepts, and evaluate the time needed to absorb large amounts of subject matter.

Around the world, the first year of university study is considered a critical period of transition for most students (Brinkworth et al., 2009; Krause and Coates, 2008), and therefore it is a valuable time  for  promoting  change  in  their  personal  epistemological  beliefs  about  knowledge  and learning  (Haigh  and  Kilmartin,  1999;  Brownlee  et  al.,  2009).  Research  studies  and  anecdotal accounts also suggest that many students require further development of their self-directed and self-regulated learning skills to be successful at university (CredŽ and Kuncel, 2008; Dynan et al., 2008; Hattie et al., 1996; Jansen and Suhre, 2010). This is important in light of evidence of great  diversity  in  pre-university  study  skills  preparation  (Jansen  and  Suhre,  2010)  and  a continuum of self-directed learning readiness in most cohorts (Fisher et al., 2001).

The  importance  of  designing  structured  ÒpowerfulÓ  learning  environments  (De  Corte,  2003), which  promote  effective  self-regulated  learning,  is  strongly  advocated  in  the  educational psychology  literature.  De  Corte  argued  that  carefully  designed  learning  environments,  which foster studentsÕ engagement in active and constructive learning processes and provide sociocultural  supports  via  interaction  and  collaboration,  not  only  promote  better  learning  outcomes but  also  benefit  future  learning.  Similarly,  Kirschner  et  al.  (2006)  claimed  that  Òa  strong emphasis on guidance of the studentsÕ learning processÓ (p.75) is more effective than minimally guided  instruction.  Dynan  et  al.  (2008)  found  empirical  evidence  that  self-directed  learning development is enhanced in more structured learning environments. They concluded that such environments  should  therefore  be  provided  in  the  early  years  of  university  study  since  they would benefit the majority of students. Guiding transition towards more autonomous forms of learning  may,  however,  best  take  place  in  collaborative  learning  settings,  as  suggested  by Raidal and Volet (2009) based on their research with preclinical students, and widely supported by research on the value of peer learning at university (Springer et al., 1999).

One potentially useful way to address some of the difficulties associated with the transition to university  learning  is  to  make  explicit  the  skills  for  self-directed  learning  and  to  facilitate  their development  through  targeted  teaching  and  learning  activities.  Since,  according  to  Schunk (2001), self-regulated learning behaviours are Òhighly context dependentÓ (p.125) and students are strategic in their approach to learning in different contexts, promoting the development of self-regulated  learning  skills  should  be  customised  to  studentsÕ  content  learning  to  have  the greatest impact.

Research  on  the  development  of  self-regulated  learning  skills  embedded  in  the  teaching  of content  learning  in  first  year  at  university  is  still  scarce,  especially  in  science  (Schraw  et  al., 2006).  The  capacity  to  select  appropriate  resources,  and  to  reflect  and  evaluate  their appropriateness,  is  particularly  relevant  to  effective  study  at  university.  Also  important  is  the

competence  and  commitment  to  reflect  on  what  has  been  learnt  through  the  completion  of assignments, in terms of learning content as well as learning skills.

The aim of the present study was to examine the extent to which students could be induced, through  designing  a  content  quiz  with  a  group  of  peers,  to  develop  some  basic  skills  for university study.

## Research methods

## Participants

Participants were first-year students (a mixed cohort of animal science, pre-vet and biomedical science)  enrolled  in  a  biology  unit  in  the  year  2010.  Volunteers  for  the  research  project, embedded within the unit, were recruited in class. Students were informed that the study aimed to develop a better understanding of their experience of learning through the completion of one of  the  assessed  tasks,  the  Ôcontent  quiz  group  assignmentÕ.  They  were  told  that  participation would involve the completion of one questionnaire, as well as consent for researchers to access their written reflections on the content quiz group learning assignment, their group mark for the content quiz assignment and their overall mark for the unit.  Sixty-five per cent of the class (94 students:  72  females,  22  males)  volunteered  to  participate  in  the  study.  (This  sex  ratio  was representative  of  the  overall  class;  69%:  31%).  As  not  all  students  were  present  when  the project was presented in class, the participants are highly representative of the whole class.

Students enrolling in this first year biology unit are typically in their first year of tertiary study, and  many  have  entered  university  directly  from  completing  secondary  education.  80%  of respondents were aged 20 years or under and 20% 21 or over.

The content of the unit provides an overview of 1) the structure and function of the animal body, including basic cellular biology and organ systems, and 2) the evolution and diversity of living animals. Assessment in this unit comprises standard assessment types: a short written essay; mid-  and  end  of  semester  theory  exams  incorporating  a  variety  of  multiple  choice  questions; short answer and extended answer questions; and a practical exam.

## Procedure

## The content quiz group assignment

The content quiz group assignment was designed especially for this study and was used for the first time. The assignment had three specific learning objectives. Students were directed to use this task: firstly to make connections between lecture material and resources (including learning objectives  and  keywords)  and  laboratory  activities  and  resources  (including  the  veterinary anatomy  museum);  secondly  to  develop  research  skills,  primarily  text  book  use,  including accurate  referencing  of  appropriate  sources;  and  thirdly  to  experience  collaborative  learning (through small group activity, use of student produced resources, and feedback/clarification via the online discussion board).

In practice, students were invited to form self-selected groups of two to four peers. Their task was to produce a five question self-test activity for the rest of class based on the unit content. Groups had two weeks in which to prepare their quiz questions in their own time (no teacher). A template for the format of the questions was provided to enable questions to be uploaded into the  self-test  tool  of  the  online  unit.  The  five  questions  (matching,  short  answer  and  multiple choice) had to incorporate at least three of the key words from the designated lecture topic (as specified in lecture summary document). Each group also had to include at least one image, typically  a  photo  taken  during  laboratory  class  or  in  the  veterinary  anatomy  museum,  upon which the multiple-choice questions were to be based. It was expected that this would enhance the connections between lecture and laboratory material, encourage exploration of the museum as a learning resource and decrease the likelihood of students using questions from the internet or texts. Each group had to provide the answers to the questions they had developed, and also had to provide feedback on anticipated potential misunderstandings by other students. As for any assignment, appropriate referencing for all information and images was required. The group assignments had to be submitted within two weeks of the given lecture on which the questions were based in order to enable the inclusion of the questions to the weekly online self-tests. The online quizzes were an optional resource for peers to test their understanding of the topic and

formed part of their individual study program. Students received immediate feedback on their performance.  Marks  for  this  formative  Ôself-assessmentÕ  did  not  contribute  to  the  overall  unit mark of students.

Following their group submission, each individual student was required to complete a reflection exercise of approximately 150-200 words describing the extent to which they felt that they had achieved the learning objectives of the group assignment.

## Data collection and instruments

Data  sources  were  a  questionnaire  and  written  reflections  completed  at  the  end  of  the semester, and studentsÕ individual marks for the unit.

## Questionnaire

The  questionnaire  elicited  information  on:  reported  use  of  resources  for  completing  the assignment and usefulness of those resources; perceived usefulness of the content quiz group learning assignment to enhance learning; and an open-ended question about possible change in learning on completion of the content quiz group assignment.

Reported use of resources for completing the assignment, and usefulness of those resources . Students  were  asked  to  rate  the  extent  to  which  they  used  a  number  of  resources  (list provided) from 1 (not at all) to 4 (a great deal), with the option of adding other resources. Table 1  describes  all  the  resources  presented  for  rating.  These  are  divided  up  into  three  broad categories: core, accessory and optional.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Following use ratings, students were asked to indicate which three resources they found the most useful sources of information.

Students  were  also  asked  to  rate  the  extent  to  which  completing  the  group  assignment encouraged them to use a variety of resources, and if in the process they had discovered new resources for learning.

Perceived  usefulness  of  the  content  quiz  group  learning  assignment  to  enhance  learning . Students were asked to rate the extent to which this assignment had enhanced their learning, more specifically lecture content, level of detail required in the unit, learning skills for the unit, learning skills to revise content for exams and learning skills for university study overall.

Furthermore, in relation to content (core resource), students were asked to rate the extent to which the assignment helped them see and make connections between the different learning materials, link the information presented in the lectures and activities conducted in the labs, and enhanced their understanding of the structure and function of the animal body.

The extent to which they used the online quizzes from their peersÕ group assignments within their revision practices was also elicited. All questions were rated on a scale of 1 (not at all) to 4 (a great deal).

Finally  an  open-ended  question  invited  students  to  comment  on  how  they  had  changed  their learning or study technique as a result of completing this assignment, if at all.

## Written reflections

In  order  to  encourage  reflection  on  how  this  assignment  helped  achieve  the  stated  learning objectives, all students were required to prepare a short written submission at the end of the activity. Their reflections were expected to include some discussion of the resources they found useful, their group work skills, and any changes they might make to their strategies for group work and content learning in the future. Students were expected to write between 100 and 200 words although some students wrote considerably more.

## Results

## Use  of resources  to complete  the  content quiz group  learning assignment  and relationship to achievement

Use of resources. StudentsÕ  reported  use  of  learning  resources  to  complete  the  content  quiz group  learning  assignment  is  presented  on  the  left  hand  side  of  Table  2,  organised  in descending order within the core, accessory and optional categories, and Figure 1 illustrates the findings.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

## TABLE TWO AND FIGURE 1 ABOUT HERE

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Online  lecture  notes  summaries  online  were  the  most  heavily  used  among  the  core  learning resources. This was expected, given that to complete the assignment students were required to identify the learning objectives from the lecture summary. However, the fact that not all students utilised  these  resources  is  cause  for  concern,  and  highlights  the  fact  that  even  when  clear instructions have been provided, students do not necessarily follow them.

Second most heavily used resources were the online unit lecture presentations (a complete set of  PowerPoint  slides  presented  in  lectures).  Heavy  use  of  this  learning  resource  was  also expected, as the PowerPoint presentation would be highly valuable for review of key concepts presented in the lectures.  It would also hopefully relate them to the context in which they were used in the content quiz assignment.

Interestingly, the next most highly used resource was not the recommended unit textbook (third core  resource)  but  websites,  recommended  by  the  teacher  as  only  an  optional  resource. Websites  appeared  to  be  used  quite  broadly.  This  was  not  unexpected,  though  potentially injudicious use of non-peer reviewed or non-ÔacademicÕ material from the Internet may lead to misconceptions relating  to  content.  As  illustrated  in  Figure  1,  the  unit  textbook,  considered  a core resource by the teacher, appeared to be used a little or not at all by 40% of the students.

Considering accessory unit resources, the finding that half the class used the laboratory manual was  pleasing  in  that  it  suggests  that  students  were  reviewing  the  manual  and  seeking connections  with  the  lecture  material.  Limited  spontaneous  use  of  the  veterinary  anatomy museum  in  its  physical  and  online  versions  was  not  unexpected  from  a  class  of  first  year students, who had thus far only been recommended these resources.

Among  the  optional  (non  unit)  resources  and  apart  from  the  websites,  the  findings  that approximately 40% of the class spontaneously consulted library or digital reference books was noteworthy  since  students  had  not  been  given  any  direction  regarding  the  use  of  such resources.

Finally, very few students reported consulting journal articles. This was not surprising since the requirements of the content quiz group learning assignment focused on basic concepts.

Overall, the data on reported use of resources highlight the fact that most students referred to the  core  resources  to  complete  the  content  quiz  group  assignment,  albeit  not  always  the textbook,  which  would  have  provided  valuable  complementary  information.  The  widespread consultation of websites may need closer examination in future research to discover what types of websites are consulted and how the information is used. First year students should benefit from  guidance  as  to  how  to  select  reliable  web  resources  for  their  study.  The  findings  also indicate students used a diversity of other resources, perhaps more diverse than anticipated for first  year  university  level.  The  extent  to  which  first  year  students  are  aware  of  the  range  of resources available to them, and how these can be used to enhance their learning, needs to be addressed in future research.

Relationship of resource use to achievement .  To address this issue, two resource use scores were computed for each student: a total resource use score, representing the sum of usage score for all ten resources, and a core resource use score representing the sum of the three core  resources.  No  significant  relationships  were  found  between  core  resource  use  and individual  marks in  the  unit  ( =-.02)  or  group  mark  for  the  assignment  ( =.09).  With  regard  to r r total  resource  use,  no  relationship  was  found  with  individual  marks  for  the  unit  (r=.01)  but  a

moderately  significant  relationship  with  group  marks  for  the  assignment  ( =.21, r p &lt;.05)  was detected.

Overall,  these  findings  suggest  that  use  of  resources  does  not  necessarily  mean  appropriate and effective use. The moderate relationship between total resource use and group marks for the assignment, however, suggests that studentsÕ extensive use of multiple resources had some positive impact on the quality of their group assignment.

## Perceived  usefulness  of  sources  of  information  to  complete  the  content  quiz  group learning assignment

The  right  hand  side  of  Table  2  shows  the  percentage  of  students  who  rated  the  different resources  as  their  first,  second  or  third  preference.  The  three  core  unit  resources  were considered to be the most useful resources to complete this assignment by the majority of the class. The highest scores for first preferences were the lecture summaries, lecture presentations,  websites  and  recommended  textbook  (in  decreasing  order).  From  a  teacherÕs perspective, the high scores for the core unit resources is a positive result and suggests that these references are useful and appropriate to the learning objectives of the unit. Of the noncore and optional resources available to students, websites were highly utilised and ranked as one of the most useful resources by a large proportion of the class. As noted above, as the choice and content of websites were not moderated by the teacher, the accuracy of the material presented within those websites could not be validated.

Overall resource use. Quantitative (Table 3) and qualitative data (comments about resources) suggest  that  students  did  perceive  a  change  in  how  they  used  resources  subsequently  to completing the assessment task.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

TABLE THREE ABOUT HERE

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Seventy  five  percent  of  respondents  agreed  that  completing  the  assignment  encouraged  the use of a variety of resources (mean score of 3.01). Students commented that they,

Use a variety of sources now.

Investigate  all  resources  available,  and  compare  all  the  notes  I  have  (own  notes, presentations, summaries).

More than 50% of respondents identified additional resources, some specifying that they,

Learnt how to access more library resources for study.

Further,  some students showed an awareness of the importance of using reliable sources of information:

I  am  also  confident  that  we  have  referenced  reliable  sources  of  information  in  order  to assure the accuracy of our quiz questions and answers.

## Perceived usefulness of the content quiz group learning assignment to enhance learning

Content learning .  Table 4 presents the mean rating scores for student perceptions of different aspects of learning as a result of completing the content quiz group learning assignment.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

TABLE FOUR ABOUT HERE

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

More  than  80%  of  the  class  indicated  that  this  assignment  was  a  useful  tool  to  enhance understanding  of  lecture  content  and  concepts  within  the  unit.  The  strongest  ratings  of perceptions  of  student  learning  were  that  the  content  quiz  contributed  to  enhancing  their understanding of the lecture content (mean 3.29) and of their understanding the animal body (unit content; mean 3.34).

Over 70% said that the assignment helped them to see the connections between the different teaching and learning activities within the course (mean 2.94).  One of the aims of the content quiz  group  learning  assessment  was  to  highlight  to  students  that  laboratory  classes  were designed to support and illustrate the information presented in the lectures. With this in mind, students were encouraged to produce images of specimens that highlighted the concepts within their chosen topic. In this way students were deliberately encouraged to look for links between their chosen lecture topic and laboratory activities.

Learning skills . The extent to which students thought they had developed generic learning skills alongside content learning, through completing the content quiz group learning assignment was examined.  Sixty-seven  percent  of  respondents  indicated  that  completing  the  assignment resulted in the development of learning skills that would be helpful to revise for exams in this unit (mean 2.91). This finding is illustrated in studentsÕ comments presented in the next section.

To  a  lesser  extent  students  reported  development  of  transferrable  learning  skills  for  the  unit (mean 2.65) and more broadly for their university study (mean 2.62). Interestingly, there was no difference  between  their  perceptions  of  learning  skills  for  the  specific  unit  (course)  and  for university  study  in  general.  The  perceived  transferability  of  skills  was  encouraging,  although somewhat surprising as students often  report  study  techniques  that  are  discipline-specific,  in this instance studying biology perceived as different from learning in mathematics or chemistry.

## Metacognitive experiences in the content quiz group learning assignment activity

A  number  of  students  commented  in  the  open-questions  (questionnaire  and  assessed reflections  of  the  assignment)  that  completing  the  assignment  made  them  more  conscious of focusing  their study  around  the  learning  objectives  given  for  each  lecture,  rather  than indiscriminately trying to learn everything that was covered in a lecture.

I think it was a great assignment to do as it made us pinpoint the key points we needed to learn and expand on them.

I read and understand the learning objectives and key words for each topic now.

- [I] learned to refer to learning objectives.
- I think I've become better at picking out the key point from each lecture and topic instead of trying to learn every little detail.

These  are  positive  outcomes  from  this  assignment.  Clearly,  as  teachers  implicitly  expect students  to  organise  their  learning  around  the  learning  objectives  they  have  supplied,  it  is evident  that  without  guidance  only  some  students  will  make  these  connections.  By  making these requirements explicit, students in this study learned where to look for information and how to appropriately prioritise their learning activities.

Students also reported that completing the assignment allowed them to identify how they might change their study behaviours to enhance their learning. For example,

It became apparent [that] I needed to study the information in greater detail

Summarising notes, creating practise questions.

Other students commented that completing the assignment highlighted the importance of good note taking during lectures (in addition to simply having printed out the PowerPoint slides):

[I] must be able to take more comprehensive notes.

Such comments also reveal that some students were developing an awareness of their learning processes  (metacognition),  and  that  targeted  assessment  strategies  were  a  useful  tool  in enhancing this awareness. The development of learning skills leading to deep-level engagement with the content was also identified, for example,

Being  required  to  formulate  questions  for  others  generated  ownership  of  the  topic.  It encouraged  me  to  master  the  topic.  It  required  more  time  but  the  learning  was  more deeply entrenched than if I were just trying to read about a topic

## Discussion and conclusions

The results of this small scale study provide evidence that learning skills development embedded within an undergraduate content unit has potential to help first year studentsÕ transition to more self-directed forms of study.

The content quiz group assignment investigated in this study was successful in helping students develop some basic skills for self-directed learning at university. Firstly, students were required to identify and use key learning resources (in particular lecture summaries). Although not all students referred to lecture summaries to guide their learning, most identified these summaries as very useful in completing the assignment and subsequently as an important tool to structure their self-guided study. Secondly, students were induced, through the development of their content quiz, to make connections between lectures, laboratory classes and key resources. The need to produce images of specimens from the laboratory sessions or veterinary anatomy museum, and to include them in their content quiz directed them to make greater connections with the key learning concepts. Thirdly, students had to demonstrate their capacity to use research skills, through their critical evaluation of resources and appropriate referencing. There was evidence that students consulted a wide range of resources and strategically used them in producing their content quiz questions.

While promoting self-directed, active forms of learning can enhance content understanding (Bary and Rees 2006; Dynan et al., 2008; OÕShea, 2003; Blumberg, 2005) and the development of both discipline-specific and transferrable learning skills, it has been argued that in order to become self-directed learners, many undergraduate students need structured support (CredŽ and Kuncel, 2008; Dynan et al., 2008; Hattie et al., 1996; Jansen and Suhre, 2010). Central to successful self-directed learning is the ability to seek, recognise, effectively use and evaluate appropriate resources. As argued by Railton and Watson (2005) the directive to students to Ôgo and readÕ is fraught with difficulty when students might not know what or how to ÔreadÕ and what to do with their knowledge. The content quiz assignment addressed this issue by examining the value of giving students a clear purpose and immediate application for their study of specific concepts. Having to formulate questions to test their knowledge and to provide appropriate answers and explanations was instrumental in that regard. Engagement in such activities is important in light of evidence that while many university students lack skills for effective study, most are reluctant to attend generic study skills workshops because of a perceived lack of relevance (Durkin and Main, 2002). The present study demonstrated that the development of effective learning skills could be fostered when embedded in content learning. By embedding specific skills development within discipline units, the relevance of such skills is made more explicit since it is directly linked to the acquisition of content knowledge. Such an approach is consistent with Railton and WatsonÕs (2005) recommendations for Ôteaching autonomyÕ.

The inclusion of a short reflective task was also instrumental in encouraging students to think metacognitively about their learning skills as well as their developing content knowledge. Zepke and Leach (2010) recommend that institutions promote studentsÕ development of selfcompetence in order to enhance engagement, motivation and success. However, it has also been noted that students who are unsuccessful in first year may be over confident of their study skills (Goldfinch and Hughes, 2007). In any case, the ability to accurately self-assess oneÕs own learning progress, and to link learning outcomes to learning strategies, is essential for successful study. Consequently, encouraging students to reflect on their learning strategies and study skills is likely to contribute to their development of more autonomous forms of learning.

The inclusion of metacognitive reflection exercises within science content units at university is not common practice. Yet, recent research revealed studentsÕ capacity for valuable, in-depth reflection on their learning processes (Thurman et al., 2009). The present study showed that short reflections were a simple and non-threatening way of helping students think about and hopefully further develop their learning skills. For increased benefits, more emphasis should be placed on metacognitive reflection across units of study in the hope that this would further enhance self-direction in learning. Fostering permanent shifts towards deep learning strategies might be more challenging (Wilson and Fowler, 2005), yet worth pursuing, embedded within existing methods of assessment. It should be stressed that the content quiz assignment used in this study would be easily adapted to use in a range of disciplines.

This study has a number of limitations. First, it was modest in scope, being undertaken with only one cohort of students, in the context of one unit at one university. The cohort, however, was quite diverse in terms of studentsÕ course of study and academic background. Students were enrolled in a range of biological science based courses and represented a wide range of academic abilities (based on large variations in the average entry level scores for these courses). Other limitations were methodological, including the absence of control group and the reliance on self-report data collected at the end of the activity. Furthermore, studentsÕ prior experiences of learning autonomy were not accounted for as part of the research, and may have impacted perceptions of the usefulness of the activity. Data collection of prior learning experiences, including a survey of study skills confidence, would provide a better understanding of prior experience. Although the use of volunteers may not provide a balanced view of all studentsÕ experiences and perceived outcomes, the fact that almost all students who were present when the data was collected opted to participate brings some confidence in the representativeness of perceptions within this student population. One aspect not examined in this study, given the small sample, is the extent to which small group dynamics had an impact on student experiences and perceptions, since data from within groups is not completely independent. The findings of this study, therefore, should be interpreted with caution and will necessitate replication with other cohorts, other units and across disciplines.

A number of unanswered questions may provide the impetus for further research. What emerged from this small study is that the development of basic self-directed learning skills required for university study can be fostered successfully, when embedded within content units. The range of ways in which this can best be achieved, however, is yet to be investigated. This study examined only one possible instructional strategy for the development of a limited number of study skills. Other instructional strategies, equally adaptable across units and disciplines of study, could be developed and their usefulness established from the perspective of students and teachers alike, and using both subjective and objective measures. Offering first year students the opportunity to practise self-direction embedded within their content units, with a group of peers and under the close guidance of the teacher is promising and should be investigated further.
