Candy,  P. C.  (1991).  Self-direction  for lifelong learning.  San Francisco:  JosseyBass.  547  pages.  ISBN  1-55542-303-5.

The term  self-direction may  not be  common in art education  discourse,  but the  concepts  it  represents  pervade  the  field.  For  example,  art teachers  consciously  balance structure with  choice-making (self-direction)  in their curricula according  to student abilities and self-confidence.  Teachers also want students to  develop  their own ideas in their studio work  and, eventually,  to set their own goals  and artistic  problems.  Such is the  essence  of  making  art.

Candy points  out that self-direction  is not one  concept,  but four. The  first concept  that he examines is self-direction as  personal autonomy. According  to Candy,  as a  regular part  of most educational  goal statements,  personal  autonomy  could  serve as the  primary organizing principle  for educational  practice. An autonomous  person,  for  example,  can conceive  goals,  exercise freedom of choice,  reflect  rationally,  and exercise self-restraint and  self-discipline.  He also notes  that,  in  general, autonomy  increases with  age,  that a  person  can learn to be more  autonomous,  and that  developing  it is a  lifelong project. However,  he warns that  usually personal autonomy  varies  according  to the situation and the person's  view of  the  situation,  e.g.,  not  every  business  entrepreneur  displays autonomous  characteristics when  learning  to make or discuss art.

Although  self-direction is a  familiar,  almost  taken-for-granted concept  for art teachers,  it is  relatively  new to  adult educators.  Ever since Houle  (1961)  and then  Tough  (1971)  showed  that adults learn  primarily through  methods  that rarely  include a hired teacher and classroom  setting,  adult educators have  spent major  research  efforts  in  understanding  self-direction  phenomena. In  this book, Candy  seeks to  bring  order to this vast new  body  of work. Even  though  the scope  of  Candy's  book is broader than art  education,  his detailed  analysis  can help  art educators  take  a fresh look  at their  goals  and  practices.

The  second  concept  of self-direction  focuses  on  educational  autonomy, or, that collection of attitudes and skills  required  to  self-manage  one's  learning.  An autonomous,  self-directed  learner  can,  for  example,  conceive  learning goals, exercise  freedom  of  choice  in  choosing  learning goals,  reflect  rationally  and critically  on  the  ideas  of  others  and  oneself, and  use  self-discipline in  the learning enterprise.  Adult educators interested in  measuring  a  generic ability  or readiness for self-directed  learning  have been  particularly  active with this concept  of  self-direction.  Candy's  discussion  of  educational  autonomy  should be useful to  anyone  who is interested  in  developing  self-directed  learning  skills in themselves.  However,  another  recently published book, Flow, by  Csikszentmihalyi (1990),  covers the  topic  in more  depth.

It is from  Candy's  review of the literature of the third and fourth  conceptions of  self-direction  that  art educators will find the  most  useful  information,  for these describe  teaching  and  learning  methods. The third  concept  of self-direction  is  autodidaxy,  the  intentional independent  pursuit  of  learning.  In  this construct,  learners  set  goals  and  largely determine,  with  the  intervention  of circumstance, how  learning  will be conducted. Resources  might  include a  book, a short non-credit  course,  and the advice of a  neighbor. Topics  can  range  from

yard  maintenance  to watercolor  painting  to  parenting  skills.  Candy  cautions that no  learning project  is  truly  independent;  it  always  occurs in a social context. Central to an  independent  learner's success is the quality  of the help he or she is able to  get. Candy  devotes most of his discussion of  increasing  one's ability  to be an autodidact to the characteristics of the ideal  helper  or mentor. Research has shown that  personal caring  and  support  are  probably  as  important  as expertise in this  helping  relationship.  Teachers  of  non-credit  classes  in the  community might  be able to use this discussion to  guide relationships  with their  highly  selfdirected  students.

The fourth  concept  focuses on the formal classroom  setting.  It is concerned with the amount of structure or control  imposed by  the teacher on  teaching  and learning processes.  Noting  that too much of the literature  ignores  the  place  of teacher  control,  Candy  states  that the  amount of control must be  articulated according  to the readiness of the student to learn. For  example, beginners  will usually  need  more  structure.  Candy  also reminds teachers  that the  notion  of learner control is  complex, involving aspects  such as  goals,  methods of  learning, and  methods  of  evaluation.  A  teacher  who  strives  to  hand  over  control  to students must do so in all of these  areas.  Pointing  out that  ultimately  it is the subjective  state  of  students  that determines  their amount of  self-direction  or control  of  learning,  Candy  laments  the  lack of  research on  control  from the student  point  of view.

Although  there  is  only  a  small  amount  of  evidence  that  giving  students control  over their  learning  in  the  formal classroom  setting  transfers to  selfdirection behaviors outside the  classroom, Candy points  out that teachers still need  to work toward it.  Among  the  strategies  Candy  lists are contract-based learning, experiential learning,  individualized  instruction, personalized  instruction,  and  discovery  learning. There is  mounting  evidence that  using  such strategies  increases  curiosity,  critical  thinking,  and  the  quality  of  understanding. Other  suggestions  include:  making  use  of learners'  existing knowledge  structures;  encouraging deep-level, personally meaningful learning; increasing question-asking by learners; developing  critical  thinking;  and  creating  a  supportive climate for  learning.  At  the core of  helping  learners  gain  a sense  of  personal control is  providing  them with  repeated opportunities  to exert control and then getting  them  to  recognize  that  they  are  the  source  of  their  success  when  it occurs.

The constructivist view of  learning,  which  Candy  describes  extensively  as the basis of his  analysis  of self-directed  learning,  should also be of interest  to art educators. Constructivists view  learning  as a  qualitative  transformation of understandings  rather than an accumulation of information.  Learning proceeds  as the  person  is able to make his or her own  meanings  from  experience.  Constructivists  are  interested  in  studying  the  learner's  perspecive  and  how  learning occurs in the "real  world." In this  view, objective  tests and teacher-led  critiques are not so  important as, say, keeping  a  learning  journal  and  engaging  in  regular self-evaluation.  Such a view has  gained  momentum  recently  in art education circles  through  the  Arts  Propel project (Gitomer,  Grosh,  &amp;  Price,  1992).

Self-direction  for Lifelong  Learning  is the definitive reference for the  study  of self-directed  learning. However,  it is  probably  too detailed and  theory-oriented to  hold  the  attention  of  the  average  teacher.  The  author  is  an  Australian professor  of adult education  theory  with ties to American and  European  academic communities. He moves  easily  and  clearly through  an extensive  body  of

theoretical  and  practical  material  and has  gathered  an exhaustive reference section.  Any  one of these  components  -  theoretical  formulations, implications for  practice,  or review of  the  literature -is worth the  purchase  of this book.
