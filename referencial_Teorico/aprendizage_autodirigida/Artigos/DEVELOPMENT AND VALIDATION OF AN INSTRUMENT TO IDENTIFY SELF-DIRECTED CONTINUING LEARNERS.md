## DEVELOPMENT AND VALIDATION OF AN INSTRUMENT TO IDENTIFY SELF-DIRECTED CONTINUING LEARNERS

LORYS F. ODDI

## ABSTRACT

This study sought to describe the personality characteristics of self-directed continuing learners, develop an instrument to identify such learners, and conduct empirical investigations to validate the instrument.  Dimensions of the self-directed continuing learner's personality were developed and then used in the construction of an item Prepilot and study results provided the basis for refining the items into a 24-item instrument When administered to a sample of 271 graduate students; the instrument demonstrated pilot

Estimates of construct validity were obtained through correlation of scores with measures of educational participation, adult intelligence; self-confidence; endurance, and affiliation; results suggest the instrument is valid tool for identifying self-directed continuing learners when used in its entirety - an internal consistency of .87 and a test-retest reliability of 89.

The inadequacy of extant conceptions of self-directed learning has been noted in a recent literature review (Oddi, in press). Criticism of definitions of self-directed learning tend to center on the lack of perspectives on the whole on lifelong learning (Brockett, 1983). Brockett (1983), Brookfield (1984), and Griffin (1978), among others, have also identified the lack of a robust theoretical construct for self-directed learning. existing

In an effort to learn more about the phenomenon of self-directed learning

The explication of unified concept of self-directed learning would have important implications for the adult population in general and in particular for professionals who must have high degree of motivation to learn in order to maintain   competence throughout their careers (Dubin, 1974). Houle (1980) presented for the professional begins in earnest entry into practice. Yet selection procedures for entry into professional schools (which are oriented to intelliachievement, and aptitude) do not predict which individuals will continue to learn throughout life (Gunzburger, 1980). The potential to continue learning throughout ones career is seldom, if ever, considered as part of selection procedures, possibly because the characteristics of those who possess this potential are not well defined. after gence,

present study sought to (a) describe theoretical formulations for the personality characteristics of self-directed continuing learners, (b) develop an instrument to identify such learners, and (c) conduct empirical investigations to validate the instrument.

## THEORETICAL PERSPECTIVES

Traditionally self-directed learning has been viewed as process of self-instruction, various investigators to focus on the of the learner to execute the steps in the process: set goals, develop and implement learning plan, and evaluate results\_ Education theorists (such as Bruner, 1961; Dewey, 1951), however, maintain that the process of instruction does not account for all, or even for most, of the human learning that occurs. Thus, a view of selfdirected learning as self-instruction would seem to offer too limited scope for such a complex activity. The perspective adopted in the present study, therefore; focused on the personality characteristics of individuals whose learning behavior is characterized by initiative and persistence in learning over time through variety of learning modes, such as the modes of inquiry, instruction; and performance proposed by Houle (1980). The term self-directed continuing learning" was adopted from "self-directed learning;' term which is generally used in reference to self-instructional process. leading ability

## METHODOLOGY

## Development of Theoretical Formulations

PDIRD . This dimension focused on the learner's ability to initiate and persist in learning without immediate or obvious external reinforcement. The term 'proactive was used to encompass the competence motivation theory of White (1959) and the humanistic theoretical perspectives of Maslow (1970) and Rogers (1969). Repeatedly, attributes of self-directed learners in the literature were described in terms commonly associated with the autonomous, self-actualizing individual who seeks opportunities to grow and fulfill potential. The "learningoriented' continuing learners described by Houle (1961) and the experts iden-

Initially an extensive list of personality characteristics of self-directed learners was compiled from recurring themes in the writings of experts on self-directed learning and from research findings suggesting empirical support for these variables. Logically related attributes were then successively divided into groups and eventually refined into three broad overlapping clusters hypothesized as the essential personality dimensions of self-directed continuing learners. Each dimension was conceived as lying on continuum having two poles; one of which related to individuals marked by high amounts of the characteristic (i.e., self-directed continuing learners) and one of which related to individuals marked by low amounts of the characteristic (i.e., non-self-directed continuing learners) The three dimensions so described were termed Proactive Drive versus Reactive Drive (PDIRD), Cognitive Openness versus Defensiveness (CO/ D), and Commitment to Learning versus Apathy or Aversion to Learning (CL AAL) being

tified by Brookfield (1981) seem to demonstrate intrinsic motivation to be effective in dealing with their environments and to grow. Thus, a combination of competence and self-actualization motivaton could logically serve to explain such initiative and persistence in learning behavior

COID. Knowles (1975) and Lindeman (1961), among others, identified openness to change as an essential attribute of the self-directed learner. Although there was little empirical support encountered in the literature for this thesis, this dimension was included in the theoretical formulations because of the strength of such experts' opinions.

The salient characteristics of PDIRD consisted of self-regulating behavior, possession of high self-esteem self-confidence, and engagement in selfinitiated and self-sustained learning activity directed toward higher level At the opposite of this dimension were the reliance of the individual on extrinsic forces to stimulate learning, tendency to discontinue activity on en countering obstacles, engagement in learning to meet lower order needs, and low self-confidence\_ and goals. pole

Salient characteristics of CO/D included openness to new ideas and activities, ability to adapt to change, and tolerance of ambiguity. The opposite included attributes such as rigidity, fear of failure, and avoidance of new ideas and activities\_ pole

Salient characteristics of CL/AAL included the expression of positive attitudes toward engaging in learning activities of varying sorts and a preference for more thought-provoking leisure pursuits. The opposite included expressions of indifferent or hostile attitudes toward engaging in learning activities and reports of less engagement in activities commonly regarded as promoting learning: pole

CLIAAL. The line of learning orientation research stimulated by Houle (1961) provided a basis for hypothesizing this final dimension: Learning orientation research has consistently demonstrated the existence of groups of individuals who find learning enjoyable for its own sake; tend to seek learning on a continual basis, and actively participate in learning through variety of modes Con versely, studies by Houle (1961) and Johnstone and Rivera (1965), among others, suggested that some individuals exhibit little or no interest in learning, participate in few learning activities of limited variety, or engage sporadically in learning activity only when seeking a specific goal.

These three dimensions of the self-directed continuing learner's personality were assumed to be interrelated and mutually reinforcing: They combine to enable this individual to extract information and learn from life, be it via selfplanned learning projects; participation in formal or informal group learning activities, or reflection on personal performance and life experiences. The pleasure and satisfaction derived from learning enhance the individuals self-confidence and promote further receptivity to learning; thus, the self-directed continuing learner tends to initiate and persist in learning, exhibiting trend of behavior directed toward increasing growth and self-fulfillment through learning:

## Construction and Analysis of a Pilot Instrument

The core dimensions of the theoretical formulations guided the construction of 100 items, number calculated to allow elimination of unsatisfactory items

through item analysis procedures. Content validation of the items was achieved by subjecting each item to review by a of graduate students in law, nursing, and adult education and of experts in areas relating to the study of psychological constructs or self-directed learning: panel panel

Purpose and criteria for the study. The purposes for administering pilot instrument were to (a) identify improvements needed in the format and directions for completion of the instrument, (b) determine the internal consistency of the instrument with a larger sample, (c) investigate the number and kinds of factors that could be derived from the data, and (d) revise or delete according to the results of the factor analysis. pilot pilot items

Items deemed content valid (n 65) were assembled as a self-report instrument with response options arranged on seven-point Likert-type scale to provide for optimum reliability without creating a cumbersome number of response options (Nunnally, 1978). Approximately half were reverse items, advocated by Thorndike (1971), to eliminate response bias. These items were administered as pre-pilot instrument to 30 volunteers involved in the study of law, nursing, and education. Items identified as unreliable through analysis of the pre-pilot data were then eliminated from the item pool.

Criteria established for the development and testing of the instrument included: pilot

- No fewer than seven items would be included for each core dimension.
- 3 . Items preventing the test from relatively pure measure of a factor would be revised or eliminated (Nunnally, 1978) . being
- 2 Items with factor loadings of 40 and above would be considered in the interpretation of factors.
- 4. Different subjects would be included in the pilot study from those in the pre-pilot study.

Factor analysis yielded factors accounting for 44.59 of the total variance. Although the factor structure underlying the pilot data was not identical to the original core dimensions, nonetheless; oblimin rotation yielded five interpretable factors judged to relate logically to these dimensions; these served as a basis for revision of ten items for use in the final phase of development of the study instrument.

Validation instruments. Four instruments of known reliability and validity were selected to provide estimates of external validity of the OCLI: Filler items were removed from the Leisure Activity Survey (LAS) (Litchfield, 1965\_1966), measure of the extent to which adults participate in educational activities; the remaining core of the LAS was selected to provide convergent validation of the CL/AAL dimension of the OCLI. The Internal-External Scale (I-E Scale) (Rotter, 1966), measure of individual differences in locus of control, was selected to provide convergent validation of the COID dimension Four subscales of the Adjective Check List (ACL) (Gough &amp;   Heilbrun; 1983), self-report The

Self-Confidence subscale (ACL-S-Cfd) was  selected to provide measure of convergence with the self-confidence and initiative comprised by the PDIRD dimension. The Affiliation subscale (ACL-Aff) was selected to provide mea sure of convergence with the element of involvement with others as seen in the CL/AAL dimension. The Change subscale (ACL-Cha) was selected to provide a measure of convergence with the elements of open-mindedness and flexibility contained in the CO/D dimension The Endurance subscale (ACL-End) was selected to provide measure of convergence with the tendency to in learning as included in the PDIRD dimension. persist

The 26-item OCLI was administered to different sample of 271 graduate students in law nursing, and adult education in conjunction with a demographic data survey instrument and one of the instruments selected to provide a measure of discriminant or convergent validity. (Table 2 depicts the distribution of validation study instruments among the groups of study participants). A retest was administered to 34 volunteers equivalently distributed among the three student subgroups two weeks following initial administration of the OCLI.

The literature suggested that the to be a self-directed learner is related to neither intelligence nor to intellectual achievement. This assumption has received support in the studies of Chickering (1964) and Gunzburger (1980). Therefore, in order to provide a measure of discriminant validity for the OCLI, the Shipley Institute of Living Scale (Shipley) (Shipley, 1982), which provides an estimate of adult intelligence, was employed. ability

## FINDINGS

The total group (n 271) exhibited range of 117, mean of 123.627, standard deviation of 19.026, and median of 126. The obtained skewness value of 802 was significant at the 01 level\_

Similar were obtained for each of the three subgroups: Law students (n 110) exhibited a range of 117, a mean of 119, and a median of 119. Adult education students (n 83) exhibited range of 105, a mean of 125.434, and findings

median of 129. Nursing students (n exhibited range of 99, a mean of 128.231, and a median of 130. 78)

Two demographic variables correlated significantly   with the total OCLI scores: sex (r 228, p .0001) and age (r 250, p .0001). There were no significant correlations between OCLI scores and the educational level of participants, level of family income, mother's educational level, or father's educational level.

## Reliability

Two items in the OCLI demonstrated unsatisfactory correlation with the total score and were removed from the instrument.  Analysis of the remaining 24 items yielded an internal consistency (standardized coefficient alpha) of 875. Testretest reliability was 893.

## Factor Analysis

Factor analysis of data obtained from the study sample yielded three principal components accounting for 45.79 of the total variance Rotation by an oblimin technique yielded three interpretable factors.

Factor II, Ability to be Self-Regulating,  contained three salient items and accounted for 89 of the total variance. Items clustering on this factor had clustered similarly in the pilot study and represented one of the elements in the PD/RD dimension of the theoretical formulations\_

Factor I contained 15 salient items and accounted for 30.99 of the variance; it represented elements from the PDIRD dimension of the theoretical formulations (which had also been obtained in pilot Factor I) and gained additional items reflecting the ability to work independently and to learn through involvement with others. These additional items warranted consideration of Factor 1 as general factor rather than as discrete factor reflecting a particular dimension of the theoretical formulations

Factor III, Avidity for Reading, contained four salient items and accounted for 6.89 of the total variance. These items reflected portion of the CL/AAL dimension and had clustered similarly in the study. Items related to other modes of learning tended to cluster in OCLI Factor I, the general factor. Table 3 depicts the factor loadings of OCLI itemspilot

The failure of separate factors in the OCLI to adequate amounts of the total variance made it necessary to use the total OCLI scores to assess validity of the instrument explain

## Validity

Scores on the OCLI correlated positively (r 363, # = 004) with scores on the LAS. Scores also correlated positively with scores on numerous subscales of the ACL: ACL-S-Cfd, (r 551, p &lt; .0001); ACL-End, (r 539, p &lt; .0001); and ACL-Aff (r 265, p 04). These positive correlations suggest convergent validity of the OCLI, as well as providing support for elements of the PDIRD and the CLJAAL dimensions of the theoretical formulations. A measure of discriminant validity was provided when scores on the OCLI failed to correlate significantly (r .040, # .754) with scores on the Shipley.

Contrary to expectations, OCLI scoresdid not correlate significantly  with either the ACL-Cha (r .020, p 928) or the I-E Scale (r 040, p = .73) .

## DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS

## Discussion

The OCLI is an instrument of satisfactory reliability and stability. It can be concluded, on the basis of correlations of OCLI scores with other instruments of known reliability and validity, that the OCLI is a valid instrument when used in its entirety.

The reliability of items revised from the pilot was improved; this revistudy

sion, however, appears to have altered the structure of the underlying variables, producing factor analytic results differing in some respects from those of the factor structure. The OCLI should be further refined; such refinement should focus on strengthening individual factor scores and clarifying the relationship of such variables as open mindedness, involvement with others, and self-regulation to self-directed continuing learning behavior. As is true of any newly developed instrument; the OCLI should be involved in further investigations to establish construct validity through a variety of measurement techniques. pilot

The relatively high mean and median attained by both the total group and the subgroups may indicate that the sample contained high number of selfdirected continuing learners. The of significant negative skewness value offers further support for this possibility. There is need to investigate further  performance on the OCLI with different samples, in particular, with applicants to formal professional study and with adults in the population finding general

It is not clear whether there are, in fact, age and sex differences in mance on the OCLI, or whether these differences result from other factors of selection; such as age and sex differences among the three subgroups of the sample. Older students tended to be included within the nursing and adult education student subgroups; these subgroups also contained proportionately more women than did the younger law student subgroup. It is interesting to note that age is pants in adult education (Coolican, 1973; Johnstone &amp; Rivera, 1965). Age has also been identified as factor in motivation for participation (Boshier, 1977; Johnstone &amp; Rivera, 1965; Sabbaghian, 1980). perfor -

There are varying findings with respect to sex. In one study (Kay, 1981), sex, with age, was found to be influential among participants in adult edustone and Rivera (1965), however, found virtually no difference between men and women in incidence of learning interest. Both Morstain Smart (1974) and Boshier (1977) found that women tended to express more interest in learning for the sake of learning than did men. Clearly, the relationship of selfdirected continuing learning behavior to these two variables needs to be more fully explored. along and

## Implications

This study provides a foundation for further investigations of self-directed

In departing from the traditional view of self-directed learning as confined to the mode of instruction and focusing, instead, on the defining person characteristics of individuals who initiate and persist in learning through various modes, the present study provides new perspective to recent efforts to define self-directed learning. The development of a valid and reliable tool to identify self-directed continuing learners has implications for practice after fur ther validation studies have been conducted, such as, potential use as a screening tool to aid in the selection of individuals for various academic and continuing education programs. being ality

continuing learning: Both the development of theoretical formulations and the construction of the OCLI as reliable and valid measuring tool provide new direction for future study. Such studies might take as their focus, for example, exploration of whether motivation to learn precedes or follows development of directed continuing learning behavior, identification of antecedents for developing self-directed continuing learners; clarification of the relationship between intrinsic motivation of children and the self-directed continuing learning behavior of adults, the effects of various types of feedback on the learning efforts of adults, and additional attributes associated with self-directed continuing learners.
