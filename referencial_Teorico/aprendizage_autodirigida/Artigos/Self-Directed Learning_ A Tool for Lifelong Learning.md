## Self-Directed Learning: A Tool for Lifelong Learning

## Stefanie L. Boyer , Diane R. Edmondson , Andrew B. Artis 1 2 3 and David Fleming 4

## Abstract

A meta-analytic review of self-directed learning (SDL) research over 30 years, five countries, and across multiple academic disciplines is used to explore its relationships with five key nomologically related constructs for effective workplace learning. The meta-analysis revealed positive relationships between SDL and internal locus of control, motivation, performance, selfefficacy, and support. The use of an actual SDL project in an undergraduate sales management course and an MBA selling and sales management course is used to provide supporting evidence and practical advice for educators seeking to use SDL to promote lifelong learning skills in students.

The best college educators tailor their topics and methods to effectively prepare students for future careers (Taylor, Hunter, Melton &amp; Goodwin, 2011). Often, this is accomplished by using various 'active learning' techniques that engage students more than traditional lecture-based practices (Diamond, Koernig, &amp; Iqbal, 2008; Taylor et al.,  2011;  M.  R. Young, 2005, 2010). One active learning technique that is showing great promise in the preparation of students for postcollege life is self-directed learning (SDL). SDL is a process by which learners manage their own learning process from beginning to end (Knowles, 1975). Research has shown that SDL is positively related to many education-related constructs: academic performance, aspiration, creativity, curiosity, and life satisfaction  (Edmondson,  Boyer,  &amp; Artis,  2012);  however,  limited research exists on how SDL is related to workplace-learning constructs.

College students who are taught how to be proactive and self-directed learners will be better prepared as employees to anticipate their organization's needs, tailor their learning to meet their own unique learning styles, and acquire the necessary skills, knowledge, and abilities to create value for their customers,  employers,  and  organizations  (Artis  &amp;  Harris, 2007; Cron, Marshall, Singh, Spiro, &amp; Sujan, 2005; Tobin, 2000). With employees capable of applying SDL methods, U.S.-based  organizations  may  be  able  to  reduce  and  more effectively apply the estimated $125 billion spent annually on  training  that  is  dominated  by  lecture-based  methods (Patel, 2010). The purpose of this study is to synthesize the current research on SDL through a meta-analytical review of important  nomologically  related  variables.  In  addition,  we will discuss practical applications of SDL in the classroom given factors found in SDL projects as well as a content analysis of responses from students who used SDL in a graduate course.

## Self-Directed Learning

Since its 1967 introduction by Tough within the adult learning literature, SDL has been shown to be a highly effective method to engage and train adult learners (Ellinger, 2004). In the 1970s, SDL research focused primarily on identification and  definition.  Knowles  (1975)  provides  the  most  widely accepted definition with eight elements: (a) it is a process (b) that is initiated by the individual, (c) which may or may not involve the help of others, (d) to identify their learning needs, (e) develop learning goals from these needs, (f) find the necessary resources to attain these goals, (g) select and implement the proper learning strategies to meet their goals, and (h) determine how to measure learning outcomes.

In the 1980s and 1990s, SDL research focused primarily on  the  antecedents  of  learner  behavioral  intentions  toward

SDL as measured by their readiness to engage in SDL based on  potential  learner  responses  to  a  scale  developed  by Guglielmino in 1977 (e.g., Barnes, 1999; Chang, 1990; Chien, 1998; Durr, 1991; Gardner, 1989; Gardner &amp; Helmes, 1999; Graeve, 1987; Hoban &amp; Sersland, 1997, 1998, 1999; JudeYork, 1991; Middlemiss, 1987; Moore, 1987; Posner, 1989; Roberts, 1986; Skaggs, 1981; Wall, Sersland, &amp; Hoban, 1996; Wood, 1994; D. J. Young, 1986). More recently, efforts were made  to  research  actual  usage  of  SDL  (i.e.,  Boyer,  Artis, Solomon, &amp; Fleming, 2012; Fleming &amp; Artis, in press), and this has caused a return to the SDL project as first conceptualized by Tough (1967) as the unit of analysis. An SDL project is defined based on four characteristics: It is (a) deliberate, (b) related activities that (c) take up at least 7 hours to complete within a 6-month period, while (d) generating specific knowledge, skills, or lasting change in the learner.

In 2000, Clardy extended the SDL concept by developing a  typology of four types of SDL projects within the workplace:  induced,  synergistic,  voluntary,  and  scanning.  An induced SDL project is mandated by the firm (Clardy, 2000), and  these  projects  are  used  when  employees  are  unsure  of what they need to know, where to find the information, or how to confirm they have achieved the learning  objective. Employers  provide  employees  with  the  information  and assess what was learned, but workers must still self-regulate their learning (Artis &amp; Harris, 2007). For example, mandatory continuing education courses required to meet regulatory standards (e.g., industry certification) would be considered an induced SDL project. Second, synergistic SDL projects are what  Clardy  (2000)  terms  'gateway  opportunities.'  In  this case, the educational materials are provided by the organization, but employees can choose whether or not to participate, and learning is assessed only by the employee. A synergistic SDL project  is  useful  when  employees  are  aware  of  what knowledge is needed but do not know how or where to find the information. Artis and Harris (2007) cite corporate libraries  as  an  example;  the  firm  makes  available  materials  to study-books, CDs, and so on-but the employee decides what to study and how to apply what is learned. The third type of SDL project is known as voluntary . According to Clardy (2000), these SDL projects are entirely enacted by employees and happen when workers know what knowledge is needed, where to find the necessary information, and how to evaluate what they have learned. An example of a voluntary SDL project  would  be  when  a  financial  services  representative  at  a bank  decides  to  learn  more  about  investment  strategies  to improve his/her ability to build long-term relationships with key customers; he/she then independently searches, locates, and learns the necessary information to achieve the desired competency. Scanning is the fourth type of SDL project. It is similar to a voluntary SDL project in that employees know what knowledge is needed, where to find the necessary information, how to categorize and use it, and how to assess what they have learned; but it is distinct from a voluntary project in that it is an ongoing SDL project with no predetermined end (Clardy, 2000). An example of a scanning SDL project would be  the  salesperson  who  continuously  monitors  and  studies competitors'  offerings  to  better  explain  to  clients  his/her firm's unique selling proposition and value.

In 2007, Artis and Harris extended the notion of SDL into the marketing domain by providing a conceptual model of the use of SDL projects by salespeople. Through a review of  the  SDL  literature  they  proposed  four  antecedents,  two moderators and one mediator of the use of SDL projects. The four individual-level characteristics they identified as antecedents  are  (a)  learner  self-directedness,  (b)  confidence  in self-directed  learning  skills,  (c)  contextual  understanding, and (d) motivation to learn. A learner's readiness to use SDL is  similar  to  these  antecedents,  and  much  of  the  literature/ research used to develop the Artis and Harris (2007) model were also used within this meta-analytical review. The two moderator variables are (a) environmental turbulence and (b) organizational  learning  climate.  The  mediating  variable  is willingness to use SDL projects. In their framework, the construct  'willingness  to  use  SDL  projects'  is  a  proclivity toward engaging in SDL behaviors to achieve personal learning objectives. It is this framework, designed specifically for the marketing domain, that guides the following meta-analysis, and its underlying theoretical structure serves as the basis for the cardinality of the relationships.

## Literature Review and Hypothesis Development

This  meta-analytic  review  investigates  the  relationships between SDL and five nomologically related constructs: (a) internal locus of control, (b) motivation, (c) performance, (d) support, and (e) self-efficacy. The constructs were chosen due to their abundance in the literature and their theoretical links to SDL either as an antecedent (internal locus of control, motivation, support, and self-efficacy) or as an outcome  of  SDL  (performance).  While  the  meta-analysis itself does not infer directionality or causality in the relationships found, the underlying theory of those nomological links do provide sound justification for expectancies of directional relationships.

## Internal Locus of Control

Internal locus of control (ILOC) is the extent to which individual employees believe they have control over events that influence them. Those with higher levels of ILOC believe that event outcomes result primarily from their own behavior, whereas those with low levels of ILOC believe that others, fate, or chance determine consequences (Rotter, 1954). Employees with higher levels of ILOC demonstrate greater job  commitment  (Werbel,  Landau,  &amp;  DeCarlo,  1996),  use more problem-focused coping methods (Srivastava &amp; Sager,

1999), have higher levels of job satisfaction and job performance  (Spector,  1982),  and  believe  that  their  efforts  will affect  goal  attainment  (Lefcourt,  1982).  Transformational learning theory predicts that SDL improves when adult learners are given greater levels of control over the 'what, when, and how' of learning (Mezirow, 2000). Adult learners get more out of the learning opportunity when they are provided with  input  and  some  element  of  control  over  the  learning method,  the  materials,  the  learning  environment,  and  the evaluation of learning effectiveness (Speck, 1996). Because of  this,  employees  with  higher  levels  of  ILOC  should  be more  likely  to  engage  in  SDL,  given  that  they  must  take some degree of control for their  own  learning  efforts.  For example, a study of 103 registered nurses found that higher levels of ILOC were reported for those nurses who were selfdirected learners (Skaggs, 1981). Therefore, nurses who felt that their own actions would make an impact on outcomes important to them were more likely to use SDL for workrelated success. In their work, Artis and Harris (2007) note that  one  of  the  unique  aspects  of  SDL  versus  traditional learning is that the locus of control for SDL belongs to the learner rather than to the teacher. In addition, they identify the trait of learner self-directedness as an antecedent of salesperson willingness to use SDL. This trait includes the belief that the learner can effect personal change through one's own efforts and abilities, which is the same as individuals with high internal locus of control. Similarly, Guglielmino (1977) identifies  ILOC  as  a  component  of  readiness  to  use  SDL. Hence, the following hypothesis is created:

Hypothesis  1 :  Higher  internal  locus  of  control  leads  to greater SDL readiness.

## Self-Efficacy

Self-efficacy is an employee's belief in his/her ability to be successful  in  different  situations  (Bandura,  1977a).  Selfefficacy  differs  from  ILOC  in  that  ILOC  relates  to  beliefs about  control  over  situations,  whereas  and  self-efficacy relates  to  the  individual's  belief  in  his/her  own  ability (Maertz, Bauer, Mosley, Posthuma, &amp; Campion, 2005). An employee's level of self-efficacy plays an important role in approaching  challenges  and  setting  goals.  It  stems  from social learning theory, such that an individual's actions are influenced by observing others' actions and reactions (Bandura, 1977b). These observations shape cognitive processes and develop an individual's confidence in his/her own ability by comparing their own ability to what they observe in  others.  Those  with  higher  levels  of  self-efficacy  in  one task  may  believe  that  they  can  be  successful  and  perform well and may approach different tasks with the belief that they  are  capable  of  producing  desirable  results  (Bandura, 1977a). Organizations that are constantly facing new challenges from customers and the environment require higher levels of self-efficacy from employees. For example, a survey of 575 workers across various industries found that those who reported lower levels of self-efficacy were less likely to be self-directed learners (Posner, 1989). In their framework, Artis and Harris (2007) identify confidence in SDL skills as another antecedent to willingness to use SDL, and they note that 'self-directed learners benefit from being taught, practicing, becoming proficient, and feeling confident in the use of core learning skills' (p. 13). This definition is almost identical  to  the  definition  of  self-efficacy.  Thus,  the  following hypothesis is proposed:

Hypothesis 2 :  Greater self-efficacy leads to higher SDL readiness.

## Motivation

Motivation is the force that drives employees to work toward their  goals  and  is  often  manifested  in  their  willingness, desire, or commitment to perform tasks that will lead to goal attainment. It is an important construct in business and has been widely studied relating to its strong positive impact on performance  (Churchill,  Ford,  Hartley,  &amp;  Walker,  1985). Transformational learning theory posits that adults' commitment to learning is greater when they feel that the goals of training are important and when they have control over the learning method (Mezirow, 2000). This commitment manifests  itself  as  motivation.  For  example, in a survey of 253 human resources personnel, those employees who reported higher levels of self-motivation and achievement orientation also reported spending more hours completing SDL projects (Livneh, 1986). Artis and Harris (2007) note that motivation should be stronger than all of the other antecedents of willingness to use SDL due to the fact that it can subordinate all other  active  variables. They  also  state  that  this  motivation may be either intrinsic or extrinsic and can be explained by expectancy theory. According to their application of this theory,  if  the  learner  sees  a  potential  positive  outcome  from using SDL (valence), they believe that the actual use of SDL has  a  high  probability  of  generating  or  resulting  in  that desired outcome (instrumentality) and that the investment of effort in SDL will actually lead to the goal (expectancy), then the learner will have greater willingness to engage in SDL (e.g., they will be more ready to used SDL). From this foundation, the following hypothesis is proposed.

Hypothesis 3 : Higher levels of motivation lead to greater SDL readiness.

## Support

Transformational learning theory emphasizes the importance of support from peers and leaders for successful adult learning (Mezirow, 2000). In work situations, employees'

attitudes,  behaviors,  and  emotions  are  influenced  by  their perceptions of support from coworkers and direct supervisors. Support is the perception that others in the organization, such as managers and coworkers, value employee contributions  and  care  about  employee  well-being  (Eisenberger, Huntington, Hutchison, &amp; Sowa, 1986). Employees who feel supported will be more satisfied with and more committed to their job, which translates to decreased turnover and higher performance (Edmondson &amp; Boyer, 2012; Riggle, Edmondson, &amp; Hansen, 2009). Eisenberger et al. (1986) suggest  that  providing  support  to  employees  will  encourage them to reciprocate by participating in organization-enhancing  behaviors.  Managers  instill  a  sense  of  support  among employees when they allow them to learn at their own pace and provide help with training when needed. Adult learning theory suggests that learners require follow-up and support for effective learning, since transfer of learning is not automatic and must be facilitated for sustained knowledge attainment, which  suggests that learning requires structured feedback  and  support  from  coworkers  to  reduce  fear  and judgment from failures in learning (Speck, 1996). Artis and Harris  (2007)  note  that  organizational  learning  climate should serve as a moderator of the relationship between individual characteristics (learner self-directedness, confidence in SDL skills, contextual understanding, and motivation to learn) and willingness to use SDL. It is their contention that learners in organizations that have a climate that is supportive  of  learning  will  show  a  stronger  positive  relationship between  their  individual  characteristics  and  willingness  to use SDL than learners in organizations whose climates are not supportive of learning. However, in their discussion of this construct, they also state that 'the training function . . . can positively influence the successful use of self-directed learning  by  salespeople'  (p.  17).  This  indicates  that  there may also be a direct impact of organizational learning climate  or  organizational  support  of  learning  on  employees' willingness  to  use  SDL  and  ultimately  their  actual  use  of SDL. In addition, Boyer et al. (2013) found that there is a direct impact of employee perceived supervisor support for SDL on employee use of SDL projects, a relationship that the Artis  and  Harris  (2007)  conceptualization  treats  as  being fully mediated by employee willingness to use SDL. From this evidence, the following hypothesis is formulated:

Hypothesis  4 :  Higher  levels  of  support  lead  to  greater SDL readiness.

## Performance

Transformational learning theory underscores that improved performance is among the central goals for adult learning at both  the  individual  and  group  levels  (Mezirow,  2000).  In practice,  adults  with  higher  levels  of  expertise  are  more likely  to  use  SDL  as  they  exhaust  instructor-led  learning resources  and  are  forced  to  self-manage  their  learning  to increase  their  knowledge,  skills,  and  abilities  (Ellinger, 2004).  Methods  to  increase  job  performance  are  heavily sought  in  business  and  academia  (Jaramillo,  Mulki,  &amp; Marshall, 2005; Pappas &amp; Flaherty, 2008; Tuten &amp; Neidermeyer, 2004). Performance encompasses job-specific behaviors that include core job responsibilities (Motowidlo &amp; Van-Scotter, 1994). This type of performance is an important subject for inquiry as it encompasses job activities that must  be  performed  for  compensation  and  advancement within the organization. Speck (1996) suggests that providing control to learners will also lead to increases in performance. Effective employee learning leads to greater levels of competency  and  expertise  (Lambert,  Ohai,  &amp;  Kerkhoff, 2009). Employees who report higher levels of readiness to use SDL also report higher levels of job satisfaction and job performance (Bromfield-Day, 2000). According to the Artis and Harris (2007) framework, the link between willingness to use SDL and performance relies on the intervening behavior of SDL use. This makes sense as just being ready or willing to use SDL alone should not improve performance in the absence of the behavior itself. Fishbein and Ajzen (1975) in their Theory of Reasoned Action also defined the sequence of events as follows: beliefs and attitudes (e.g., support, selfefficacy,  internal  locus  of  control,  and  motivation)  lead  to behavioral intentions (i.e., willingness to use or readiness for SDL), behavioral intentions lead to behaviors (i.e., SDL use), and behaviors lead to outcomes (e.g., performance). To further  support  this  sequence,  Boyer  et  al.  (2012)  found  that support  leads  to  greater  SDL  use  and  SDL  use  leads  to improved performance. While they did not explicitly test the entire  Fishbein  and Azjen  (1975)  sequence,  their  findings imply that the sequence does apply to this context as attitudes  should  not  lead  to  this  type  of  behavior  without  an intervening  behavioral  intention  stage.  Therefore,  the  following hypothesis is proposed:

Hypothesis  5 :  Higher  levels  of  SDL  readiness  leads  to improved performance.

## Methodology and Results of the Meta-Analytic Review

The  inclusion  criteria  for  articles  in  this  meta-analysis  of work-related  variables  are  guided  by  those  used  in  the Edmondson, Boyer, and Artis (2012) meta-analysis of academic-related variables. To be eligible for inclusion in this meta-analysis, a study must have reported a Pearson's correlation coefficient ( r ) between any measure of SDL and at least  one  of  the  five  constructs  investigated  in  this  study (ILOC, self-efficacy, support, motivation, or performance). Studies containing other statistics that can be converted to r ( F value, t value, p value,  and  Ï )  were  also  eligible. 2 Because  of  this  statistical  requirement  only  those  studies

with interval or ratio measures of SDL were included, and the time frame for eligibility included all studies available prior to June 2010.

Also, in line with Edmondson et al. (2012), a multisampling approach was used to create a representative and complete  final  database.  A  computer  search  of  ABI/Inform, PsycINFO, Emerald, Science Direct, Ingenta, ERIC, OVID, Wiley Interscience, OCLC First Search, Web of Science, and Dissertation  Abstracts  was  completed  to  identify  relevant published  and  unpublished  studies.  Studies  containing  the term self-directed learning, Self-Directed Learning Readiness Scale,  SDL,  and  self  directed  learning  (no  hyphen)  in  the title, abstract, and/or full text were considered. Next, the reference section of each article or dissertation identified from the above searches was examined to determine if there were any other relevant articles. Then, to ensure all relevant articles  were  found,  all  issues  of  the International  Journal  of Self-Directed  Learning were  reviewed  manually.  Finally, leading  researchers  and  knowledge  centers  on  SDL  were contacted to obtain information and lists on SDL research, and it was verified that all articles from these list had been obtained. After completing the literature search, 34 studies met the eligibility criteria.

## Coding of Studies

The  authors  coded  studies  on  10  variables:  average  age, average educational level, average tenure, country of origin, effect size (correlation), industry, job type, reliability of both the self-directed learning scale and the other variable scales, and sample size. To check for coding quality, two researchers coded  each  study  independently.  All  minor  differences between the two coders were resolved through discussion.

## Adjustments for Artifacts

To ensure that the true relationship would not be underestimated, the effect size of each relationship was corrected for attenuation  bias  using  Hunter  and  Schmidt's  procedure (Hunter &amp; Schmidt, 2004). If a study did not include one or both of the required reliabilities, the weighted mean reliability  for  that  particular  construct  across all studies was used instead  (Geyskens,  Steenkamp,  &amp;  Kumar,  1998).  All  the reliability-corrected correlations were then transformed into Fisher's z -coefficients using the Lipsey and Wilson (2001) recommended r -toz transformation  procedure.  To  allocate greater weight to those estimates that were more precise, the z -coefficients were averaged and weighted by an estimate of the inverse of their variance ( N - 3), then converted back into correlation coefficients.

The  34  studies  included  in  this  meta-analytic  review yielded 46 correlations (see Table 1). The average study sample size across the five constructs is 183. The average age, tenure, and educational level for the respondents in the  meta-analysis  were  35.9,  8.6  years,  and  14.6  years, respectively. Studies included in the meta-analysis were conducted  in  five  different  countries:  the  United  States  (26), Taiwan (2), Hong Kong (1), South Korea (1), and Thailand (1), with three studies failing to specify where its data were collected. A  wide  variety  of  job  types  and  industries  were included:  education,  law  enforcement,  business,  military, nursing,  government,  and  manufacturing.  Each  study  contained either an interval or ratio scale measure of SDL. More than 85% (29 out of 34) used one of two self-report interval scales;  either  some  variation  of  the  self-directed  learning readiness scale (Guglielmino, 1977) or the Oddi Continuous learning  scale  (Oddi,  1984).  While  they  are  two  separate instruments, they show very high correlations (e.g., r = .83; Jude-York, 1991) suggesting that there is significant overlap within the domain of the constructs being measured, that is, both scales measure self-directed learning. Out of the remaining five studies, three were self-report interval measures of SDL preference, competency, or ability; and the remaining two studies measured actual SDL behaviors on a ratio scale in number of projects or hours. For performance measures, two of the five studies used supervisor rated, two used selfrated,  and  one  used  supervisor,  self,  and  subordinate  rated measures.

## Results

Meta-analyses  were  conducted  for  each  of  the  five  constructs.  Table  2  displays  the  results  of  the  meta-analyses, including the number of independent studies ( k ), number of respondents in the sample ( N ), average weighted correlation corrected for attenuation ( r ), the standard error, the range of correlations, the Q -statistic, and the estimated fail-safe N statistic (availability bias) for each construct. The fail-safe N s ranged  from  60  to  351,  with  an  average  fail-safe  of  136; therefore, all of the constructs passed the 5 k + 10 criterion set forth by Rosenthal (1979).

All  five  of  the  SDL-variable  relationships  had  correlations significantly greater than zero. Using Cohen's (1977) rule of thumb for interpreting effect size magnitude, a weak (small) effect size is a corrected correlation that is less than or equal to 0.10; a moderate (medium) effect size is a corrected correlation that is greater than 0.10 but less than 0.40; and a strong (large) effect size is a corrected correlation that is  greater  than  or  equal  to  0.40  (Lipsey  &amp;  Wilson,  2001). Overall, the five constructs exhibited positive relationships with  SDL. There is a strong positive  relationship  between SDL and the antecedent of self-efficacy ( r = .41, p &lt; .001), whereas  there  is  a  moderate  positive  relationship  between SDL and the antecedents of ILOC ( r = .34, p &lt; .001), motivation ( r = .26, p &lt; .001), and support ( r = .21, p &lt; .001). There is also a moderate positive relationship between SDL and the outcome of performance ( r = .26, p &lt; .001). The optimum next step would have been to use meta-regression to test the

moderating effects of the scales used to measure SDL, job type/industry, and country of origin on these relationships. However, this was not possible given the limited number of cases for each relationship creating the strong possibility of model  'overfitting'  that  can  lead  to  incorrect  or  unstable results  due  to  the  small N (van  Houwelingen,  Arends,  &amp; Stijnen, 2002).

## Application of SDL in Marketing Education

To  fully  understand  the  impact  of  SDL  on  student  performance, a second research project was designed to ground the researchers  directly  in  the  phenomenon.  The  written  comments of students who completed a semester-long SDL project were analyzed to evaluate the process and forces involved in the creation, pursuit, and completion of an SDL project. In this course, an SDL project similar to what would be expected of an employee in a real-world scenario was designed for the students.  Students  were  asked  to  compare  their  current resume  with  the  one  they  would  need  to  have  to  advance their  career  and  obtain  another  job  5  years  in  the  future. Students were then instructed to identify what skills, knowledge, and abilities were needed to 'grow into' their future resumes,  how  to  achieve  their  learning  goals  in  the  time allotted, and how to measure success. Students were given

maximum leeway to define their own SDL project (only the time  frame  was  fixed).  Students  wrote  a  learning  contract that outlined their plans for the semester. The students discussed  their  progress  in  creating  and  implementing  their SDL projects with their peers in small groups and individually with the instructor throughout the semester. In the final written report, students were asked to reflect on their experience.  A  content  analysis  was  conducted  based  on  the  19 responses to identify common themes. Appendix A provides a complete description of the instructions provided to the 19 MBA students enrolled in the Selling and Sales Management course. These instructions were designed to clarify each student's  learning  goal,  identify  how  to  obtain  the  goal,  and evaluate the progress and attainment of the goal. The same instructions  are  used  in  both  undergraduate  and  graduate courses in sales with success; however, a content analysis is reported for the MBA course because these students were all employed full time. Appendix B provides an example of the SDL project completed by one of the students in an undergraduate sales management course to illustrate the application at the undergraduate level.

## Methodology and Results of the Content Analysis

Four researchers independently assessed and coded the students' reflections to identify common themes using the qualitative software package NVivo 9. Using the same technique as Stock, Boyer, and Harmon (2010), reflections were analyzed using a word-for-word content analysis, and key concepts  were  identified.  If  the  same  theme  or  concept  was introduced more than one time in a reflection, it was only counted  once  for  that  reflection.  The  researchers  initially identified some key themes from the reflections so that the software  could  assign  cases  to  these  groups. The  software was directed to code each key concept into a specific node or subtheme. In addition to using software, researchers used the

Graneheim  and  Lundman  (2004)  method  for  conducting content analysis on the SDL project reflections. The researchers read through the reflections several times to get a sense of the  totality  of  responses.  The  researchers  independently coded each reflection. The researchers then discussed each reflection with respect to which key themes and subthemes emerged. They developed a comprehensive list of those elements  that  were  included.  This  procedure  was  used  to develop the overall themes and then the subthemes within each main theme. Coding in this manner created five main themes,  with  multiple  subthemes  (see  Table  3).  These  are consistent  with  the  constructs  previously  examined  in  the Meta-Analysis  section.  The  reemergence  of  these  themes solidifies the importance of these variables in research and when implementing SDL in the classroom.

## Internal Locus of Control

Many students remarked on the control they had over their projects.  This  presented  itself  in  two  ways.  First,  it  manifested through individualized learning, where students remarked on the fact that learning was related to their own needs, goals, desires, and time. Examples include, 'I learned at my own pace,' 'I liked the independent effort,' 'I got to choose  my  project,  develop  goals,  self-motivate,  attain something at the end that is my own,' 'I could go as far as I wanted with this project.' Consequently, SDL is positively and significantly related to aspiration.  I  set  my  goals  high and  was  responsible  for  achieving  them'  and  'I  used  the project to set my goals and develop a map to get to where I want to be.'

Second, a real-world implication theme emerged, so that it was relevant to their working lives. Students remarked that the project 'had real world application.' Students mentioned, 'This  is  real  life-beyond  the  classroom,'  and  they  used what they learned at work, 'I have been able to employ the techniques from the project in my recruiting efforts.' Overall,

students  seemed  to  really  appreciate  the  flexibility  and autonomy they had in completing their SDL projects.

## Self-Efficacy

Self-efficacy, the first of the themes that emerged, produced two subthemes: increased confidence and improved ability. Overall, students remarked that the SDL project was the factor  that  presented  them  with  improvements  in  this  area. Specific examples  of  confidence  include,  'The  project helped me increase my confidence' and 'I feel more confident that I have actual points and experiences to talk about in a  job  interview  or  another  professional  setting.'  Students who felt more able after completing the project said, 'The SDL project improved my ability.'

## Motivation

External motivation was provided because the SDL projected constituted 20% of the overall grade in the course. However, more appears to be at play. The theme of motivation emerged with multiple subthemes-rewarding, future use, recommend to others, appreciation for experience, project motivated me, and must have motivation to complete. A majority of students felt that the SDL project was rewarding. Students remarked that the project 'was a valuable experience,' 'was enriching,' 'worthwhile,' 'this was not an easy project, but it was worth the effort,' and 'this project has afforded me the opportunity to step outside the box and think 'big picture' rather than what is here and now. I set out to accomplish a goal and it is truly gratifying to being one step closer to achieving it.'

A majority of students noted that they would use SDL in the future, either when it is appropriate or as a continuation of the current project. Specifically, students said, 'I expect to use SDL in the future,' 'I will continue to create SDL projects and build on this one in the future,' and 'I will use SDL in the future whenever necessary.' In addition, some students offered advice to the instructor to continue using the project in the future. 'I recommend SDL to others' and 'this should be  continued  in  future  semesters.'  Other  students  showed appreciation  by  thanking  the  instructor  for  the  experience and the project, 'Thank you for the opportunity' and 'I am grateful for the project and now I have a mentor.'

Many students expressed that the project motivated them, 'I  was  motivated  because  of  the  structure,'  'this  project motivated me,' 'I am not only happy with my process but I was  also  able  to  learn  some  additional  unintended  things through  this  experience  which  makes  me  want  to  use  this method again,' and 'The project motivated me because it was job related and that made it interesting and I got to learn more about my field.' One student added that to successfully complete the project, you must have motivation, 'If one has the drive and motivation to accomplish a goal, it will happen.' So, it appears that the project creates motivation, and a motivated individual is more likely to successfully complete the project.

## Support

Another  theme  that  emerged,  support,  also  produced  subthemes:  'need  resources/support'  and  'found  resources.' Some students felt they needed resources and/or support to complete the project, and they included this as a part of the reflection. One student remarked,

Having to produce multiple re-writes for my original contract, it is evident that I needed more guidance in getting started with the project. When beginning the project I was unsure exactly what I was doing and how I was going to measure myself.

Other students found resources, whether they were mentors or other sources on the Internet.

## Performance

Performance  was  highly  discussed  as  a  key  theme  in  the analysis. Four subthemes emerged: improved performance, achieved goals of the project, did not meet the goals of the project,  and  success.  Success  had  some  of  its  own  subthemes: recognized at work, job placement/career advancement, acquired skills, and growth of the business. Half of the respondents noted that they experienced improved performance. Since the class was filled with working adults, all of the students were employed during the semester. Some students  remarked that  their  performance  increased  in  the area in which they were learning, 'My  performance improved in this area' and 'I feel like I really learned, my newfound success is attributed to learning and growth from this  project.'  While  others  related  their  performance  to work, 'I can tell that this project made a difference because I  feel  like  my  job  is  easier,'  'It  improved  my  outlook  at work and overall performance,' 'I have more knowledge to do my job better, this was an efficient way of learning for me,' and 'Going from not being able to speak in front of a crowd to being able to speak in front of the class while being videotaped,  is  a  major  accomplishment.'  Some  students commented on their performance regarding how well they achieved their goals, whether they did or did not meet the goals they set out for themselves. For example, 'I successfully completed most of my goals' and 'I was able to take the concepts learned and apply them to this project.' At the other end of the spectrum were 'While I did not meet my primary goal, I was able to overcome some of the obstacles that prevented me from achieving my goals in the past,' 'I achieved  most  of  my  goals,  but  not  all  of  them,'  and  'I didn't achieve all of my goals.' Overall, students met many goals but often shifted their original paths due to time and/ or resource constraints.

Some  of  the  most  compelling  subthemes  that  emerged were  those  stories  of  success.  Students  noted  that  they acquired skills because of the project whereas others noted that  their  businesses  grew as a result of the project. Many students reported triumphs at work, given the class project. For instance, some students were recognized at work, 'I was recognized by my manager,' and

I  have  been  noted  by  my  superiors  for  doing  a  good  job  and having a good handle on what needs to get done. The equipment room  has  taken  on  more  tasks  and  projects,  but  it  is  making everything more efficient and effective.

Many students were thrilled to report that the SDL project helped  them  advance  their  careers,  'I  got  a  promotion  at work,' 'I got a full time offer in my new field of auditing and accounting,'  'I  look  forward  to  starting  my  new  management position, the goal and result of completing this project,' 'I  am  advancing  at  work,  so  this  is  a  business  success.  I achieved my goals,' and 'I benefited from the projects we have in this class, I now lead visits instead of trying to avoid being noticed and I have the first round of interviews schedule for January as the hiring manager.'

## Conclusion

The  meta-analytical  review  suggests  that  internal  locus  of control, motivation, support, and self-efficacy are important antecedents  to  increase  students'  willingness  to  use  SDL. Self-directed  learning  can  also  lead  to  improved  performance, and therefore, it is important that marketing educators determine how to effectively apply SDL practices within marketing education (Edmondson et al., 2012). The content analysis  of  student  comments  provides  validation  for  the findings of the meta-analytic review and provides credibility in the ability of the meta-analysis to help explain some of the linkages  by  providing  some  data  on  directionality.  For instance, the meta-analysis does not infer causality; however, students  noted  that  the  SDL  project  improved  their  confidence and ability. In this way, implementing SDL may help students  improve  their  self-efficacy.  In  addition,  students sought out support for their SDL projects, and some were frustrated until they  received  support.  Therefore,  when implementing  SDL,  support  and  resources  should  be  provided to students. This can manifest itself in the form of technology, literature, mentorship, and any source of information that can help students succeed.

It may be necessary for the instructor to provide coaching so  that  students  can  find  their  own  path.  Most  students remarked on locus of control factors related to the SDL project. Implementing an SDL project requires students to take control of their learning, so if students are not comfortable with this, they may require additional support depending on their levels of locus of control. Students were certainly motivated by the SDL project, but it is unclear whether the SDL project motivates or requires motivation to complete based on the content analysis alone. Since the SDL project is relevant to the student, it should elicit motivation, but as students

remarked, if they are not motivated, they will not complete the project. More research is needed to fully understand the relationship between SDL and motivation. Finally, students

This is most simply executed  by creating a current resume and one that they would like to have in 5  years. By creating these, students will quickly identify which titles they  want to hold and what they would like to do. The resumes may include  promotions, job activities, and job titles. The purpose is to allow every  student to create a unique journey that will result in the greatest value for  each learner. |
| 2.  Identify the disparity of the two resumes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Once both resumes are created, the student can assess where the disparity  lies between the resumes. For example, the student may identify that he  wants to manage a marketing team, and he is a marketing student who is  unemployed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

Identify what knowledge, skills, and  experiences are required to progress to the  future resume.                                                                                                                                                                        | At this point, the student must identify the specific knowledge gaps that exist  to achieve these future aspirations. The student may identify that to be a  good leader or manager, he needs leadership skills.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

## Appendix B

## Complex SDL Project Example Using a Learning Contract From an Undergraduate Sales Management Class

In a sales management class, the educator assigns this SDL project as 20% of the total grade. David is 21, a traditional student in the class, and has completed his current and future resume. He aspires to run a company one day. He notes that he is a student now taking business courses and will soon graduate with a job that he has already accepted. He will be on a track to management through an intense 2-year training program but doesn't have experience in running a company. He  currently  works  at  a  cellular  phone  retailer  part-time selling  cellular  phones,  accessories,  and  communication plans. Since his future resume states that he will receive a few promotions and become more involved in running the company,  David  decides  that  the  experience  he  wants  to achieve to best prepare him is to create a company and run it. David is very excited and motivated about his idea. The educator cautions David that creating a company and running it may be too much to take on during one semester.

As  students  share  their  experiences  and  ideas  in  class, David  notes  that  he  already  has  it  figured  out.  Customers often  bring  their  phones  into  the  cellular  phone  company where he works and request repairs and upgrades. The company does not upgrade or customize the phone for customers (adding updated software programs, changing exterior designs of the phones, replacing broken parts like screens and remarked that the SDL project created performance improvements at work. Therefore, the SDL project improved performance in this sample.

buttons). However, David knows how to customize phones and repair them. He has identified a market and has the talent to  meet  the  needs  of  customers.  The  educator  reluctantly agrees but wants to monitor David because it is a big project.

David now identifies goals that will help him successfully run the company within the time frame. He identifies several components: file for an LLC, make $1,000 in sales, achieve a 20% profit margin, work on at least 10 devices, post two social  media  messages  each  week  to  advertise,  visit  three cellular stores each week to solicit customers, and perform one of each: buy, sell, repair, and customize a phone. After sharing the goals with the educator and the class, everyone felt that the goals were a good starting point. Since the goals were  very  clear,  it  would  be  easy  to  assess  whether  he achieved them or not. David decided to use a pass fail metric system for each item but knew that he could revise the plan if things weren't working out. He created a learning contract, signed it, and handed it in.

Each week in class, David would report that his business was doing well and discuss the struggles and successes. By the end of the class, David decided not to file for an LLC because it was too costly for business that was uncertain (he was graduating  and  didn't  have  a  reliable  person  to  take over for him). David didn't stay on track with his store visits each week, which was a failure; however, his business was so busy that he couldn't take on the new business. This also  stopped  him  from  advertising  via  social  media.  He only posted a message every other week. So much positive word-of-mouth was generated by his business that he didn't need to create additional promotion. Since he was able to report back to class and get feedback periodically, he could stay  on  track  and  feel  comfortable  with  his  efforts,  even though  he  wasn't  working  toward  achieving  some  of  the original goals.

In  the  end,  David  surpassed  many  of  his  goals.  He achieved $3,500 in sales, earned a 55% profit margin, worked on 22 devices, and accomplished three or more of each: buy, sell,  repair,  customize.  He  practiced  building  relationships with vendors and customers and experienced how logistics affects business. David also interviewed and trained several students to assess whether someone could run the business after he moved for his new position. He reported success and found that he loved managing his own business. When asked for feedback about the SDL project he reported, 'It was awesome! I learned a lot more through this than with any other class  project  throughout  my  years  here.'  The  student  was satisfied,  and  the  educator  felt  that  it  was  worth  the  effort because  students  in  the  class  appreciated  the  educator  for allowing them to learn what would help each individual student the most.
