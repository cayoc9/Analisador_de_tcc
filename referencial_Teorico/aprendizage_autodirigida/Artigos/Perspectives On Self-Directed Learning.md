## PERSPECTIVES ON SELF-DIRECTED LEARNING

LORYS F. ODDI

## ABSTRACT

Self-directed learning in adults is considered predominantly process of self-instruction. This conception is inadequate because it fails to account for persistence in learning and excludes adults who are unable to plan self-instruction\_ These inadequacies, however, can be addressed by studying self-directed learning as it relates to the learner's personLinking self-directed learning and personality has several advantages: Self-directed learning could be studied independent of the mode of learning an individual selects, relatively stable indicator of self-directed personality would be available for study, and the personality characteristics leading an individual to initiate and persist in learning would provide a more unified and comprehensive focus for the study of self-directed learning. ality. learning

The phenomenon of self-directed learning receives considerable attention in adult education literature. Numerous authors assert that the ability to be a selfdirected learner is a requirement for all adults in a rapidly-changing, technologically-complex society. Houle (1961, 1964, 1969, 1980), in particular, states that self-directed learning is essential if adults are to maintain competence and avoid obsolescence But what is self-directed learning?

The conceptual ambiguity surrounding self-directed learning is illustrated by the plethora of terms used in reference to the concept: self-education (Dick inson &amp; Clark, 1975; Smith, 1976; Snedden, 1930); independent study or independent learning (Jourard, 1967; Moore; 1972); self-teaching (Tough, 1966); self-instruction ( Johnstone &amp; Rivera, 1965; Smith, 1976); individual learning (Smith, 1976); independent self-education (Johnstone &amp; Rivera, 1965); autonomous learning (Houle, 1962; Miller, 1964; Moore, 1976; Smith, 1976); self-di rected inquiry (Long &amp; Ashford; 1976); self-initiated learning (Penland, 1979); and andragogical learning (Knowles; 1975). Long and Ashford (1976), further, imply that self-directed learning and self-actualization are synonymous terms\_

Definitions of self-directed learning in the literature are frequently confusing, overlapping in some respects and differing subtly in others The lack of a unified, comprehensive conception of and disagreement about the values and practices related to self-directed learning has been the concern of numerous authors for more than a decade (Brockett, 1983b; Brookfield, 1984; Griffin, 1978; Gruber, 1965; Houle, 1969; Macdonald, 1967; Smith, 1976).

Kasworm (1983) perhaps, most clearly articulates the ambiguity surrounding self-directed learning when she notes that self-directed learning is conceived as a "set of generic; finite behaviors; as a belief system ref and evolving from process of self-initiated learning activity; or as an ideal state of the mature self-actualized learner (p. 1). The literature reveals that the predominant perlecting=

spective on self-directed learning is one which views self-directed learning as a process; a less dominant perspective emphasizes personality characteristics as the primary focus for studying self-directed learning:

## THE PROCESS PERSPECTIVE

Those individuals who regard self-directed learning as a process vary widely in the specificity and focus of their conceptions and in the degree to which include personality characteristics of the learner as influences. Griffin (1978) describes five "streams of self-directed learning, four of which view self-directed learning as process: the group-learning stream espoused by Knowles; the learning-project stream described by Tough; the individualized-instruction stream as exemplified by programmed instruction and similar independentstudy techniques; and the nontraditional, institutional-arrangement stream which includes approaches to learning such as correspondence Knowles (1975) defines self-directed learning as the process wherein learners assume primary ponsibility for planning, conducting, and evaluating their own learning  Numerous writers (Brockett, 1983b; Cheren, 1983; Guglielmino, 1978; Haverkamp, 1983; &amp; Ashford, 1976; Mocker &amp; Spear, 1982; Skager, 1978) adopt definitions similar to that of Knowles: they study. Long\_

Some sources (National Center for Higher Education Management Systems, 1978; Snedden, 1930) the amount of assistance obtained by the learner as the salient feature of self-directed learning: This aspect seems less important to writers such as Knowles (1975) and Skager (1979) who note that obtaining help from others is not antithetical to self-directed learning: Moore (1972) also stresses that the self-directed learner is not an 'intellectual Robinson Crusoe= (p. 81). Knox (1973), however, states that the self-directed learner should be able to work 'somewhat independently' (p. 55), while Smith (1982), evidently conof self-directed learning as solitary activity, distinguishes self-directed learning from both collaborative mode (learning with others) and an institu tional mode (learning provided by organizations) . posit ceiving conception of self-directed learning as a process had led to efforts to identify skills and abilities needed by the individual to engage in the process There is considerable variation among writers as to which skills are most important. Knowles (1975), Guglielmino (1978), and Skager (1978) cite as important skills in personal for learning; identifying learning resources; and evalu the success of learning: Smith (1982) includes the ability to chart one's own learning style; use intuition, and lead discussion groups because, presumably, such skills are needed for self-directed learning. setting goals ating

Skager (1978) and Smith (1976) introduce the elements of the learner's initiative and persistence in learning while retaining basic view of self-directed learning as process. The initiative of the learner is clearly important in the view of Faure (1972), who differentiates self-directed learning on the basis of learner initiative: Similarly, Gibbons; Comeau, Schmuck, Seymour, &amp; Wallace (1980) differentiate self-education" from self-directed learning, self-directed learning as a higher order of learning which involves not only the process of self-instruction but also certain personality characteristics . Bailey, viewing

## PERSPECTIVES ON SELF-DIRECTED LEARNING 23

An assumption underlying all conceptions of self-directed learning as process seems to be that the self-directed learner engages in activities normally associated with formal instruction: setting developing strategies; choosing resources, and evaluating results. numerous learning theorists note that process of instruction does not account for all, or even for most, human learning which occurs. Learning, when viewed simply as a process of instruction, is afforded unnecessary boundaries for such complex human activity- A useful framework for examining the adequacy of the learning-as-instruction conception, however, is provided by Houles (1980) model of three modes of learning. goals, Yet,

## Modes of Learning as Conceived by Houle

Houles (1980) model depicts three major and overlapping modes of learning: instruction, inquiry, and performance. Houle conceives of instruction as "the process of disseminating established skills, knowledge, or sensitiveness" (p. 32). The salient features of instruction may include developing learning goals, plan to achieve these by adopting specific strategies; and evaluating whether or not are achieved ~in short, the classroom instruction model. Numerous sources (Brockett, 1983b; Cheren, 1983; Guglielmino; 1978; Haver 1983; Knowles, 1975; Mocker &amp; Spear, 1982; Skager, 1978; Tough, 1966), as previously noted, use the mode of instruction in reference to self-directed learning. ning goals goals kamp,

Parallels between Houle's inquiry mode and concepts of learning expressed by two learning theorists; Dewey and Bruner, can readily be drawn. Dewey (1951) observes that learning takes place by noting results, after the performance of an act, which the learner had not noted previously; moreover, he emphasizes the importance of the active involvement of the learner in reflecting on the meaning of experiences: Similarly, Bruner (1961) emphasizes the importance of the active process of discovery in the student's development into an "autonomous and selfrates on the need for reflection on experience in order to new insights and to deepen understanding and criticizes as naive the idea that, because learning is cognitive; learning through instruction can be substituted for learning through experience (Bruner &amp; Olson, 1973). gain

"The mode of inquiry is the process of creating some new synthesis, idea, technique, policy or strategy of action (Houle, 1980, P. 31) As conceived by Houle, learning outcomes of the process of inquiry cannot be predicted in ad vance and may or may not have been intended by the learner; it is, rather, after the occurrence of experience that success in learning is identified:

Bruner and Olson (1973), Elias and Merriam (1980), Knowles (1975), and Lindeman (1961) suggest that experience and inquiry are major factors in adult learning: In addition, Brookfield (1981) and Gibbons et al\_ (1980), in their studies of self-directed learners, support the notion that self-directed learning includes learning through inquiry. Brookfields (1981) "independent learners, though, did not rely on instruction to learn; rather , used several methods of inquiry, particularly experimentation and problem solving, casual encounters, and informal conversations to develop their expertise in areas of inthey

terest. Similarly, the successful self-directed learners studied by Gibbons et al. (1980) developed expertise without formal training;

The third mode of learning conceptualized by Houle (1980) is performance, "the process of internalizing an idea or practice habitually, so that it becomes fundamental part of the way in which learner thinks about and undertakes [personal] work" (P. 32) Houle includes in this mode such experiences as prolonged contact with role models and reinforcement of behavior by social sanctions. The existence of learning in the performance mode can be identified in the of Chickering (969) Cross (1976), Gibbons et al. (1980), and Knox (1973). using writings

## Evidence in Support of the Houle Model

Brookfield (1981) and Gibbons et al. (1980) provide empirical support for the Dimmock, 1983) tested the Houle typology with sample of staff nurses in community hospital by an instrument designed to measure nurses jobtime participation in continuing learning activities: Factor analysis of data in the latter study yielded two factors related to the mode of instruction group and "self"), one factor suggesting learning in the performance mode and one factor representing learning through the inquiry mode using

Both descriptive and research literature, then, raise questions about the appropriateness of learning, specifically self-directed learning, merely as an instructional  process.  There are inherent limitations in restricting self-directed learning to the process sphere: Attention is focused on discrete episodes of learning, providing neither means of interrelating such episodes nor an explanation for why such behavior persists over time in some individuals and not in others. This view, moreover, tends to result in a fragmented, incomplete conception of self-directed learning because; as suggested by Penland (1981) circumstances in the environment may govern learning behavior at given time Absence of resources for instruction or a learner's preference for learning through another no self-directed learning is occurring: viewing any

## Measurement of Self-Directed Learning

As might be anticipated, available means of measuring self-directed learning tend to view the learning as instruction-based. The learning project and the Self-Directed Learning Readiness Scale (SDLRS) are most commonly discussed in the literature.

## The Learning\_Project

Tough's interest in self-directed learning dates from 1963 when he analyzed a personal self-teaching project for a class assignment (Tough, 1979). This analidentified the steps he had taken to teach himself a foreign language: The experience, as well as various data to classroom teaching, helped Tough develop conceptual framework for investigating "self-teaching" projects. Inevysis

itably, though, Tough's framework emphasized the instructional mode of learning:

While a consistent picture of adult learning efforts through learning projects has emerged from learning project research (Tough, 1978), others (Brookñield; 1984, 1986; MacKenzie &amp; Shipp, 1981; Spear &amp; Mocker, 1982) suggest that learning through learning projects does not include all self-directed learning processes for adults. Furthermore, elements in Tough's definition seem to be contradicted by numerous adult educators. Lindeman (1961), for example, states, "The adult learner who sets forth to educate [self] in terms of any single objective will defeat [personal] ends" (p. 53). Houle (cited in Boshier, 1971) suggests the existence of adult learners who fail to focus conscious attention on learning because their lives are made up of learning that is "interwoven into the very fabric of their being' (p: 5) Dewey (1951), however, suggests that personal attention on the fact that one must learn something can actually result in the constraint of learning: Cropley (1976) on the other hand, uses the intent to learn as means of differentiating learning from schooling: fixing

A critical element of Tough's definition of learning projects is the learner's quiry mode of learning:) Tough excludes numerous learning activities from his definition such as conversations, reading newspapers, travel, and episodes wherein acquired learning is a by-product of some other task or responsibility. of the activities excluded by Tough are reported, however, in the qualitative studies of Brookfield (1981) and Gibbons et al. (1980). Many

In sum, research on adults' learning projects has tended to view learning as a self-instructional process: The congruence of language describing involvement in learning projects with terms commonly used in reference to classroom instruction illustrates this relationship: choosing goals, activities; and resources; assessing current knowledge and barriers to learning; assessing motivation to learn; and deciding where and when to learn\_ Thus, although Tough has been credited as among the first to describe clearly the self-directed learner, the learning project, as a universal model for self-directed continuing learning, is unacceptable because of its limited scope: In addition, the learning project conception tends to view self-directed learning more as an episodic phenomenon rather than as dynamic process. being

## The Self-Directed Learning\_Readiness Scale

A second popular means of measuring self-directed learning in adults is the SDLRS, developed by Guglielmino (1978). This self-report tool was developed 'primarily as a predictive or diagnostic instrument for those who are preparing to begin self-directed study in an academic area [italics added] at high school, or graduate level" (P. 77). Numerous investigations support the validity of the SDLRS in relation to learning in the instructional mode\_ For example, several studies (Mourad, 1979; Mourad &amp; Torrance, 1980; Torrance &amp; Mourad, 1978) found that SDLRS scores were directly related to higher grades in school\_ Savoie (1980) identified positive correlation between course grades  and

SDLRS scores. Hassan (1982), moreover \_ noted that those higher on the SDLRS reported a greater number of hours devoted to learning activities. scoring

The correlation between grades or hours in study and SDLRS scores, however, can not be to or describe all self-directed learning situations. A study by Long and Ageykum (1984) found that SDLRS scores were not significantly related to instructors" of college students on self-directedness in learning: Brockett (1983a; 1983b) found that the SDLRS, because of its schoolbased learning perspective; may be questionable measure of self-directed learning when used with subjects not oriented to institutional learning: In addition, two studies (Chickering, 1969; Gunzburger; 1980) suggest that the ability to be self-directed learner is not associated with measures of intelligence or intellectual achievement. applied ratings

## Limitations of the Process Perspectives

In addition to the difficulty of reconciling a view of self-directed learning with a view of learning as an instructional process, there are other limiting aspects to current conceptions of self-directed learning. Because of experiences in schooling, individuals may have considerable knowledge of how to set goals; identify resources, and evaluate outcomesSome individuals may even exhibit considerable skill in devising = courses of self-instruction as illustrated by learning project research One cannot assume, however, possession of such knowledge and skill will ensure that an individual will persist in learning throughout life; persistence is psychological variable and is not necessarily dependent upon skill.

One can conclude from the foregoing discussion that a view of self-directed learning as process of instruction is inadequate:. Similarly, the SDLRS and learning project reports should not be interpreted as general measures for the phenomenon of self-directed learning.

Gibbs (1983), who challenged the assumptions of those who feel that improvement in learning is primarily dependent on increasing skill in specific instructional techniques, supports the idea that one need not be proficient self-teacher in order to be a self-directed learner. In addition, Chickering (1976) observes that field-dependent learners who have limited capacity to be selfreferrent may be unable to plan their own learning; To assume that one must be able to engage in self-instruction in order to be a self-directed learner eliminates from consideration learning styles are not compatible with planning courses of self-instruction: using

## A PERSONALITY PERSPECTIVE

Cropley (1976), discussing learning throughout the life span, says learning is not restricted to narrow process of acquiring knowledge; rather, it is concerned with motivation and personal growth in the cognitive, affective, ethical, and aesthetic domains A unified concept of self-directed learning is enhanced, therefore; by considering a broad conception which focuses on an individuals

motivation to pursue learning throughout life rather than on the of an individual to engage in episodes of self-instruction. ability

Both   self-actualization and intrinsic motivation views share common assumption: The salient feature of ongoing involvement in learning activities lies in the learner's personality. An early Houle study (1961) identified numerous attributes of people who continue to learn. With few exceptions Oddi, 1984; 1986), however, recent literature has not focused on the personality attributes which enhance an individuals proclivity to continue omission has been noted by Griffin (1978) who termed this aspect the heuristic life experience stream of self-directed learning: Despite repeated assertions about the importance of certain psychological attributes for self-directed learning, the literature does not provide a systematic study of the self-directed learner's personality separate from the ability to engage in a self-instructional process\_ This void is surprising, especially in view of the recognition that the "essential feature of [self-directed learners'] behavior is a willingness to initiate and maintain systematic learning on their own initiative" (Skager, 1979, P. 519). Furthermore, Knox (1973) states that the of education in general is to produce an 'inner-directed, self-operating learner" (p. 47). Armstrong (1972) and Gibbons et al. (1980) identify higher level psychological needs as the source of self-directed learning behavior, and Houle (1961) illustrates the essence of selfdirected learning as an attribute of personality in his description of outstanding continuing learners who "approach life with an air of openness and an inquiring mind" (p. 3) (e.g goal

The self-directed learner has long been recognized as the humanistic ideal, the self-actualized person (Elias &amp; Merriam, 1980; Kasworm, 1983) Deci and Ryan (1981) suggested that, contrary to the humanistic ideal that maturity brings about an intrinsic motivation to learn, the desire to continue learning is the natural state of the child. In their studies of intrinsically motivated, self-directed learning of young children, Deci and Ryan observed that children's learning behavior is "active; involving, open-minded; it includes surprise and wonder; it leads children toward mastery of their environments and provides them with the tools to be more self-determining' (p. 2) hypothesize that effects exerted by the individuals environment, especially feedback provided in the learning situation; may about changes in motivation and result in the individual becoming dependent on external reward contingencies in order to engage in learning: They bring

Extant conceptions of self-directed learning neglect to account for the dynamic nature of Peterson (1978) and Brockett (1983b) emphasize that self-directed learning must be viewed with a lifelong learning perspective, while Cheren (1983) observes that there is a whole-person aspect to self-directed learning which should receive attention These criticisms can be met by moving beyond the focus on self-directed learning as set of activities in a self-instructional process to study of the motivational, cognitive, and affective characteristics or personalities of self-directed learners.

Studying the personality characteristics of self-directed learners should not detract from studying the various modes of learning used by them. Such studies are valuable and should be continued. Linking self-directed learning and the personality of learners; however, offers several advantages: (a) The relationship could be studied regardless of the mode of learning preferred or available to the self-directed learner; (b) since psychological attributes of an individual tend to persist; such a linking could offer a relatively stable indicator of the relationship which may not be possible when studying discrete episodes of learning activity; and (c) the linking of self-directed learning and personality could provide unified and comprehensive framework within which various other aspects of self-directed learning could be studied interrelated and
