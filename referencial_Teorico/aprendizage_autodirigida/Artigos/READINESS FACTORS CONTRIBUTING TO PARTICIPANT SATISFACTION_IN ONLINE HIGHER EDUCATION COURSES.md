We are looking forward to many new enterprises together. Thank you, my love.

## ABSTRACT

The main purpose of the study was to determine if selected participant readiness variables correlated with selected satisfaction variables in an online higher education course and to examine the correlations between the readiness variables. Also of interest was the combination of readiness factors that could significantly predict learner satisfaction in the online environment.

A total of 317 individuals who had participated in online courses at The University of Tennessee responded to a 'Readiness and Satisfaction Questionnaire.' The survey consisted of five readiness and five satisfaction items developed by the researcher, the PRO-SDLS developed by Stockdale (2003), and 11 demographic questions.

It was found that the reliability of the PRO-SDLS was confirmed for the population surveyed. The high level of the scale's internal consistency ( α = .91) was similar to the level ( α = .92) reported by Stockdale (2003). The demographic section of the questionnaire revealed that individuals who responded to the questionnaire were on average older, with degrees beyond the baccalaureate, and who had completed one or more online course. It also revealed that most were 'satisfied' or 'very satisfied' with the course for which they responded to the survey. Perhaps because of these participant characteristics, no significant correlations were revealed between the study's readiness and satisfaction factors. PREVIEW

Statistical analysis of the readiness factors revealed a significant correlation between self-direction and age  r ( = .287, p &lt; .01). Three of the readiness factors associated with experience correlated significantly with confidence in online distance learning. They were computer-related experience ( r = .370, p &lt; .01), experience with online collaborative environments ( r = .398, p &lt; .01), and experience with online courses ( r = .542, p &lt; .01). A stepwise regression analysis demonstrated that the factors of

experience with online courses , and computer-related experience are predictive of the level of confidence in the online learning environment .

Recommendations for further research include the need for more studies on participant confidence in the online learning environment. Further use of the PRO-SDLS especially with college and university-level students is also recommended. Finally, qualitative studies might enhance understanding of satisfaction with online courses from the participant's point of view.

## CHAPTER I

## INTRODUCTION TO THE STUDY

Distance education in the 21 st century bears little resemblance to techniques utilized as recently as 35 years ago for delivering university-level courses in settings remote from the conventional classroom. Instead of waiting for the postal service to deliver the latest correspondence installment in a course of study, or gathering before a television screen to hear an instructor's lecture, communication between students and instructor may now occur by opening an e-mail, signing in to an online chat room, or attending a virtual class on the Internet. Distance learning facilitated via the Internet has crossed geographic boundaries, providing students from around the world an opportunity to study together in online courses.

Most colleges and universities now deliver at least some courses online (Clarke, 1999; Sikora, 2002). However, this new and dynamically diverse medium has also invited competition from corporate training centers, virtual universities, and other private sector entities. This competition has raised serious concerns about the quality of online courses, especially when they are offered primarily as a means of creating revenue for the sponsoring institutions (Noble, 2001). It has also prompted speculation about a shakeout of organizations providing Internet-based education courses (Symonds, 2001). Longevity as a provider of Internet-based courses may depend largely on participants' satisfaction with their experience of learning in the online environment (Gunawardena &amp; Duphorne, 2001). PREVIEW

Satisfaction with the online learning experience has been shown to be a combination of perceptions relative to the cyber classroom environment along with the perceived educational value of the experience (Moore, 2002). Thus, institutions competing in this arena should give serious forethought to (a) the structure of their courses in this non-traditional environment, (b) students' readiness to participate in a

digital learning venture, and (c) the pedagogical processes of online education. Effective planning in these critical areas should increase the likelihood of participant satisfaction.

## Statement of the Problem

Numerous studies such as those by Anderson, Banks, and Leary (2002), Arbaugh (2001), Burnett (2001), Daughenbaugh et al. (2002), Frey and Alman  (2003), Gunawardena and Duphorne (2001), and Swan (2001) have addressed participant satisfaction with online distance education in various formats. Kuchinke, Aragon, and Bartlett (2001) suggested that participant satisfaction in university-level online courses partially depends upon various readiness factors, including self-directed learning and technical preparedness for the online environment. Gunawardena and Duphorne suggested that further studies should address a range of readiness issues as they relate to participant satisfaction in online courses.

In an interesting article, Kuchinke, Aragon, and Bartlett (2001) asserted that selfdirected learning readiness is a factor in student eligibility for online Human Resource Development (HRD) courses offered at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. The authors emphasized that participants should possess a higher degree of self-direction than is necessary for participants in a traditional classroom environment. This was based on an assumption that 'the level of self-direction required to successfully participate in a distance course is substantially greater than in a traditional classroom environment' (p. 23). As a result, enrollment in the online course was restricted to graduate students and excluded undergraduates on the conjecture that '…graduate students might be more likely to posses the required study skills and levels of self-direction' (p. 23). Although these assumptions seem reasonable, no supporting research was cited. PREVIEW

Understanding how various readiness factors relate to learner satisfaction may help program planners identify participants who will experience the greatest satisfaction

in an Internet-based instructional environment. Higher levels of satisfaction with the online learning experience may translate into higher student completion rates. Satisfaction with the experience may also increase the likelihood that a participant would engage in subsequent online learning enterprises, and would recommend the experience to others. Insights into readiness and satisfaction may also augment understanding of how learning can be enhanced in the non-traditional setting of online educational courses.

Thus, the problem addressed in this study was whether there are correlations among selected learner readiness and satisfaction factors for participants in online courses. Of interest also, was whether there was a combination of readiness factors which can predict learner satisfaction in Internet-based courses. The study also inquired about whether those participants indicating greater satisfaction are more likely to repeat the online learning experience than participants who experience less satisfaction. Purpose of the Study PREVIEW

The purpose of this study was to determine the extent to which various readiness factors correlate with a learner's satisfaction with the online educational experience. Readiness factors were limited to (a) self-direction, (b) computer-related experience, (c) experience with online collaborative environments, (d) experience with online courses, (e) confidence in the online learning environment, (f) experience with the subject matter, and (g) age. These were included because they relate to a participant's readiness for the online learning environment. Age was included because it could be assumed that younger individuals might have more computer-based experience and therefore a greater propensity for online learning than older learners.

Satisfaction was limited to five variables identified in the literature as relevant to a positive experience with online learning. They included satisfaction with (a) the overall

learning experience, (b) the technical support, (c) interactions with the instructor, (d) interactions with other participants, and (e) interactions with the content.

## Framework for the Study

In order to conceptualize the study, the research was illustrated graphically in Figure 1. The seven independent variables, or readiness factors, relate to the level of satisfaction with the online course. Satisfaction is measured in five critical areas.

As illustrated in Figure 1, the study inquired whether the dependent variables, the participants' satisfaction in five specific areas, are significantly related to the independent variables, the individuals' readiness for the experience. This graphic is intended to illustrate the framework for the following research questions. Research Questions Four research questions guide this study. They are: 1. Is there a significant relationship between individual scores on the readiness factors and the composite satisfaction score? 2. Is there a significant relationship between individual scores on the readiness factors and the individual satisfaction factors? PREVIEW

- 3. Are there significant relationships among the readiness factors of selfdirection, computer-related experience, experience with online collaborative environments, experience with online courses, confidence in the online learning environment, experience with the subject matter, and age?
- 4. Is there an optimal combination of readiness factors that would reliably predict learner satisfaction with Internet-based classes?

## Rationale

This study addresses participant's readiness for an online learning episode and the relationship between selected readiness factors and levels of satisfaction with the experience. Following is a rationale for the study derived from other research related to learners' readiness and satisfaction. Additionally, this section gives attention to the methods for measuring satisfaction.

Readiness and Satisfaction Studies Much of the research on participants in online courses has focused on learner satisfaction with the experience. In some ways, learner satisfaction is a relatively simple variable to evaluate. Kirkpatrick (1998), followed by Phillips (2000), identified four levels of evaluating training programs beginning with participant reaction, or satisfaction. Kirkpatrick emphasized that the merit of a favorable program evaluation at this level is: (1) to attract new participants and get present participants to return to future programs, and (2) as an indicator that the teaching or training environment was conducive to learning. The author added, 'Positive reaction may not ensure learning, but negative reaction almost certainly reduces the possibility of its occurring' (p. 20). Some have derided student satisfaction surveys because they do not evaluate such characteristics as actual learning or its effect on outcomes such as learner's subsequent performance (Sener &amp; Humbert, 2003). PREVIEW

However, online learning environments can have enormous impact on institutions programmatically and financially. They demand much in time from instructors and offer significant challenges to those accustomed to teaching in the classroom who must adapt their instructional style to the Internet setting. Since student reactions are crucial to the continuation of instructional endeavors, those with such high stakes as online education would surely benefit from measuring satisfaction.

Satisfaction in the online setting may also have significance beyond the scope of that envisioned by Kirkpatrick and Phillips. Since many students taking online courses for credit or certification have also taken traditional classroom courses, they have a basis to compare the learning experiences in the two very different environments. Satisfaction might well be based partly on the perception that the online class was, or was not, as educationally beneficial as a similar class might have been in the traditional setting. Sener and Humbert (2003) asserted, 'Establishing that students in online courses are comparably satisfied with their courses relative to students in traditional classroom courses helps legitimize online education' (p. 246).

Several studies on satisfaction have looked at various learner readiness factors as precursors or predictors of satisfaction. Employing grounded theory, Eastmond (1994) examined adult students' learning experiences in an online course. Using data from the study, he developed the Adult Distance Study Through Computer Conferencing (ADSCC) model as a framework for understanding the dynamics of successful learning by computer conferencing. Eastmond's study revealed that within the context of the online experience three major factors sequentially influence the student's learning

Satisfaction has been linked to various facets of the experience such as: (a) the learner's sense that the distant instructor has a social presence, (b) the provision of instructor feedback, (c) a reported phenomenon of students moving from feeling like outsiders to feeling like they are insiders in the instructional setting, and (d) the belief that the learning medium helps to 'level the playing field' in that personal characteristics that students sometimes perceive as provoking discrimination in face-to-face settings are not apparent online (Moore, 2002). Moore also noted research on dispositional and situational characteristics that are reasons for student dissatisfaction with the learning experience. PREVIEW

experience, the first of which is readiness - the personal and environmental factors that prepare the student for study in this instructional mode.

Davis (1986) and Davis, Bagozzi, and Warshaw (1989) proposed the Technology Acceptance Model to account for how ease of use, usefulness, and attitudes predict behavioral intention to use computers. Brosnan (n.d.) utilized Davis' (1986) model and included other factors to predict computer usage. Among these other factors were (a) computer experience, (b) computer anxiety, and (c) self-efficacy. Although not a study of the online learning environment, Brosnan's approach emphasized that participant readiness is predictive of computer acceptance and use.

Burnett (2001) asserted that the online environment is a natural medium for students to both accentuate and develop self-direction. Distance learning via the Internet alters the role of both teacher and student. Instead of being lecturers, teachers become 'facilitators who guide, coach, and motivate' (p. 3). In this environment, the student is encouraged to be more self-directed in planning the acquisition of learning. The online approach 'encourages students to take an active part in setting objectives, defining the contents and capitalizing on life experiences' (p. 3). This suggests that students coming into the online environment for the first time should possess a degree of self-direction.

Eastmond (1995) underscored the importance of technical readiness by stating that participating in an online course 'presupposes a level of knowledge and skill with computer telecommunications that not all adults share' (p. 90). He postulated that online studies attract students who already have some degree of technical readiness. Eastmond (1998) also noted that requisite levels of sophistication in technical skills and computer equipment vary depending on the type of online study. For example, computer conferencing requires less advanced computer-related skills than the virtual classroom approach. PREVIEW

Additionally, her claim that the online learning experience promotes further development

of self-direction may have implications for the likelihood that a participant would repeat it. Assuming that self-directed learning readiness is an important predictor of satisfaction, individuals who have completed a course may have a higher level of self-direction, and therefore a greater likelihood for success in subsequent online courses.

The level of comfort a participant has in the online environment also influences the overall satisfaction with the learning experience. Research by Gunawardena and Duphorne (2001) indicates that satisfaction is partly dependent on (a) a learner's confidence that an internet-based approach has potential for distance education, and (b) prior comfort with the medium. From their study a profile emerged of participants who were more satisfied with the online learning environment, that included 'prior technical and conferencing skills; a broader and in-depth understanding of the potential and use of computer conferencing; [and] more positive feelings toward the medium. . . .' (p. 23). Both these authors and Eastmond (1994) cited prior learning experiences and comfort with the online environment as factors in participant satisfaction. This suggests that the level of comfort is related to a participant's past experiences with online learning enterprises. PREVIEW

Eastmond (1994) stated that readiness relates to various personal factors a student brings to the learning equation that influence its success. Among those factors was an interest in the course content. Although there appear to be few studies that address this aspect of student readiness for online learning, familiarity with and interest in the course content should be considered. In both the traditional classroom and the online environment, students without previous significant exposure to a course's content or adequate prerequisite preparation for its level of difficulty would be disadvantaged. Struggling to overcome this and other readiness elements typical of the online environment could diminish the possibility of participant satisfaction.

The age of participants is of interest in this study because of two assumptions: (a) that younger individuals tend to be more comfortable with computers and the online environment than older individuals, but (b) that older learners tend to exhibit a higher level of self-direction than those who are younger. The latter assumption was stated by Kuchinke et al. (2001) as a rationale for limiting enrollment in an online course to graduate students. While the current study is not designed to confirm either assumption, the relationship of age to perceived computer-related readiness and perceived selfdirection readiness is of interest.

These studies suggest, therefore, that the online learning environment requires a favorable combination of readiness factors in order for the experience to be perceived by the student as satisfying. Additionally, it can be assumed that satisfaction with an Internet-based learning experience increases the likelihood that the participant will repeat the experience. Measuring Satisfaction Measuring participant satisfaction with online learning experiences should include factors that have been demonstrated in other studies to be important in meeting participants' expectations about the experience. The five satisfaction variables in this study were selected based on the literature reflecting other research concerning participant satisfaction with online courses. PREVIEW

Gunawardena and Duphorne (2001) and Eastmond (1995) noted that students' perception of the learning experience and the degree to which the online environment was 'user-friendly' were areas where levels of satisfaction were expressed. Several studies (Arbaugh, 2001; Soo &amp; Bonk, 1998; Swan, 2001) emphasized the importance of satisfactory interactions between participants and instructors. These include 'the instruction, assisting, stimulation and support provided by the instructor to the learner'

(Soo &amp; Bonk, 1998, p.3). Swan (2001) and Soo and Bonk (1998) also focused on the need for attention to the interactions between the participants online as well as the student-content interaction. Soo and Bonk noted that the student-content interaction includes involvement with the content and 'the constructing of knowledge through new understanding' (p. 3). Other authors such as Heterick and Twigg (2001) emphasized student attitudes toward the technical support provided in an online learning experience as a means to measure satisfaction.

This study, therefore, builds on the research cited above as well as other studies which focused on satisfaction measures. These studies are reviewed in the following chapter. Significance of the Study Distance education that takes place completely online is increasingly attractive to students, instructors, and educational institutions for a variety of reasons. It promises to enlarge the classroom beyond the university campus to include students in distant locations. Students without previous access to university-level courses may now study at a distance via their personal computers. Satisfaction studies should be helpful to program administrators, instructors, and institutions who are concerned with the quality of the experience. As will be discussed later, participant satisfaction is an important component in the development of best practice guidelines for online higher education courses. PREVIEW

As colleges and universities make increased use of online courses, it will be useful to know what personal characteristics and skills enhance the likelihood that the experience will be satisfactory for the participant. This can help instructors and institutions orient students to the kind of skills they will need to function well in the online environment. It can also assist program planners and administrators in setting realistic criteria for determining who should be admitted to an online course. Students

without the characteristics or skills shown to enhance satisfaction may wish to avoid taking an online class or may require special attention.

Because online education is both relatively new and increasingly popular as a medium of learning, accrediting agencies must develop appropriate criteria to judge the efficacy of programs falling within their jurisdiction. Satisfaction studies can provide useful data for developing standards.

A further area of significance is that the current study contributes to the literature and research in the field of adult education in various significant areas including adult learning enhanced by Internet-based courses. The focus on learner readiness for an online course can provide data for understanding what factors contribute to a learner's satisfaction with the experience. Additionally, as one of the first research studies to utilize The Personal Responsibility Orientation to Self-Direction in Learning Scale (PROSDLS) (Stockdale, 2003), it provides validation data for that instrument. The scale is discussed further in the literature review and methods chapters. The study also suggests additional areas for research. Among those could be the recommendation of other studies that take into account the learning or personality characteristics of participants. Such studies could provide an enhanced picture of factors that contribute to satisfaction with online learning. PREVIEW
