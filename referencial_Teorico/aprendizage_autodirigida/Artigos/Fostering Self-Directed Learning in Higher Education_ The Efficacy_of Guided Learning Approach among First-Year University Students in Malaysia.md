## ABSTRACT

The present study investigates the efficacy of the guided learning approach in promoting self-directedness among first-year, first-semester university students in Malaysia. Based on a sample of 37 participants, this study  employs  the  SECI  (Socialization,  Externalization,  Combination,  and  Internalization)  Model  as  a theoretical framework to examine the transfer of knowledge between the lecturer and students, as well as among students. Using an SDL (Self-Directed Learning) Questionnaire, the study assesses the students' level  of  self-directed  learning  in  the  early  stages  of  the  semester  and  then  again  following  the implementation of the guided learning approach throughout the remainder of the semester. The results of this  study  reveal  that  the  guided  learning  approach  has  a  substantial  positive  impact  on  students'  selfdirectedness, with 94.59% of the participants exhibiting an increase in their SDL level by the end of the semester. These findings reinforce the notion that a guided learning approach is crucial in fostering selfdirectedness among first-year, first-semester university students in Malaysia and, more broadly, highlight the importance of fostering self-directed learning in higher education.

## 1 INTRODUCTION

Self-directed learning (SDL) is a process where individuals take the initiative  to identify their learning needs, set learning goals, find resources, choose learning strategies, and evaluate their learning  outcomes  (Knowles,  1975).  In  contrast  to  the  teacher-centred  approach,  university students are expected to have the skills necessary for SDL, allowing them to study independently and take responsibility for their learning. However, many studies, including those conducted in Malaysia, have discovered that  first-year university students tend to learn in a teacher-centred manner (Du Toit-Brits, 2019; Ismail, 2017; Ming &amp; Alias, 2007; Wong, 2004). The phenomenon continues to persist even when self-directed learning is expected to be utilised in higher education. Based on personal observations of teaching first-year, first-semester students in Malaysia, many students still use a passive learning style, waiting for the lecturer to provide learning content rather than actively seeking knowledge.

In the era of IR4.0, with the Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and augmented reality, knowledge is accessible "at the fingertip", and access to learning resources is much easier than ever before. However, learning depends on the learners' will and effort and whether they have sufficient learning skills that can equip them to be more self-directed and independent in their learning. With all its limitations, the positive side of the Covid-19 pandemic has conditioned the practice  of  self-directed  learning,  where  university  students  had  to  adapt  to  become  more independent when circumstances do not allow face-to-face learning. During the pandemic, they have had to equip themselves with clear learning goals to empower their self-directed learning attitudes and engage in online learning (Sun et al., 2022).

Implementing various approaches and designs in learning activities allows the students to enhance self-directed learning. A study conducted by Fong, Gonzales, Hill-Troglin Cox, and Shinn (2023) found that  there  is  a  positive  association  between  academic  help-seeking  behaviour  (i.e.,  selfreported, instrumental help-seeking, formal help-seeking) and academic performance which shows the importance of guided learning empowerment that rooted in the positive interactions between the  students  and  the  learning  facilitator.  Collaborative  learning  activities  which  involve  peer interactions and discussions in small groups also can promote the development of the primary skills of self-directed learning, which are essential for students' survival at the tertiary level. Such interactions allow the students to empower their learning capacity, ask questions, identify relevant resources or tools, and make connections between the courses they study (Warburton &amp; Volet, 2013).

Guglielmino (1977) argued that the growth of self-directed learning is not fixed to one stage, but it  is  a  continuum  that  requires  the  engagement  of  the  processes  and  the  ways  of  teaching  and learning  delivery.  On  top  of  that,  the  influence  of  a  learner's  characteristics  (attitudes,  values, abilities) is a primary indicator of the successful self-directed learning process. Possession of grit character  among  university  students  is  associated  with  academic  performance,  autonomous learning,  self-regulation,  and  psychological  well-being  (Ramos  Salazar  &amp;  Meador,  2023). Although self-directed learning aims to develop independent learners, we cannot disregard that students still need assistance (lecturer's role as facilitator) to improve their self-management skills

(primarily first-year students). However, a study by Soliman and Al-Shaikh (2015) reported that students tended to have a strong desire for learning and self-control.

For university students, acquiring, classifying, retaining, utilising, transferring, and creating new knowledge is vital, and that is the cycle they need to go through to deal with life challenges, now and in the future. The capability to create new knowledge is the outcome of the transformation from  tacit  knowledge  and  explicit  knowledge  and  vice  versa  (Nonaka,  1994).  Nonaka  and Takeuchi (1995) introduced the SECI (Socialization, Externalization, Combination, and Internalization) Model as the conversion engine that generates new knowledge. SECI model can be used to reveal how lecturers' knowledge transfers to students and among students themselves. Based on constructivism as a paradigm in teaching and learning, it is believed that students build their understanding and can create new knowledge through experiencing things and reflecting on that experience. A lecturer's role as a learning facilitator provides scaffolds to improve learning skills over time. To understand the phenomenon better, this study examines the experience of first semester first-year students  in  a  public  university  in  Malaysia  in  applying  the  guided  learning approach facilitated by their respective lecturers to improve the students' self-directed learning skills.

## 1.1 The objective of the Study

This study investigates the role of guided learning in improving self-directed learning among firstyear university students by using the SECI Model as lenses. Specifically, this study intended:

- (a) To examine the impact of guided learning in improving SDL among students.
- (b)  To determine how knowledge is transferred and created from the lecturer to students and between the students by using SECI Model.

## 2 LITERATURE REVIEW

## 2.1 Self-Directed Learning in Asia

Knowles  defined  Self-Directed  Learning  (SDL)  as  "a  process  in  which  individuals  take  the initiative,  with  or  without  the  help  of  others,  in  diagnosing  their  learning  needs,  formulating learning goals, identifying human and material resources for learning, choosing and implementing appropriate  learning  strategies,  and  evaluating  learning  outcomes"  (Knowles,  1975,  p.18). Students should be active in their learning, can adapt and learn how to learn in a fast-changing and new environment (Jossberger et al., 2010; Knowles, 1975). However, self-directed learning does not occur in a vacuum, and environmental factors have long been recognised as influential (Ravid, 1987).  Learners  may  perform  different  levels  of  self-direction  in  different  learning  situations (Candy, 1991; Song &amp; Hill, 2007). Learners will be more self-directed in an area they are familiar with  or  have  similarities  to  previous  experience  (Candy,  1991).  Setting  a  supportive  learning climate,  providing  the  availability  of  resources,  and  establishing  fluent  communication  could

enhance  the  tendency  for  self-directed  learning  to  emerge  (Kops,  1993,  1997).  Creating  an environment  that  could  guide  students  to  think  about  what,  why,  and  how  to  learn,  resolving problems, and taking responsibility for their learning need to be fostered from the beginning of their study (Knowles et al., 2012). For students to achieve self-directed learning, the lecturer, as a learning facilitator, needs to function as a scaffold for them to have learning skills and know how to learn, which will improve their initiative to learn (Du Toit-Brits, 2019). These can be made when the lecturer facilitates students' initiative for SDL, empowering students toward SDL and creating a cooperative learning environment for their students (Du Toit-Brits, 2019). Self-directed learning readiness and student-centred learning should be promoted starting from an early stage of students' journey (Lestari &amp; Widjajakusumah, 2009).

Wong (2004) noted that the teaching style in Asian countries is more teachers centred, where the educator  would  provide  if  not  all,  most  of  the  information  to  the  students.  According  to Subramaniam  (2008),  the  education  system  in  Malaysia,  the  culture,  and  tradition  have  not encouraged independence and autonomy among students, which is why most students are not selfdirected learners. Ming and Alias's (2007) studies revealed that most students from all three public universities in Malaysia (the National University of Malaysia, The Putra University of Malaysia, and The Open University of Malaysia) preferred a teacher-centred approach to learning. Ming and Alias (2007) identify that socio-cultural factors may influence students' autonomy in Malaysia. Meanwhile,  Ismail  (2017)  highlighted  that  the  teacher-centred  approach  is  still  preferable  in Malaysia, which may be due to the collective culturally based education.

A study by Leatemia et al. (2016) in Indonesia revealed that only half of the students from five medical schools had a high level of self-directed learning readiness in every batch. The study stated that the rest of the students have lower self-directed learning readiness, particularly in the seniors, than the junior. The study suggested that the factors influencing self-directed learning in students were the learning method, problem-based learning, perceptions of the topics, assessments, and learning  environment.  Leatemia  et  al.  (2016)  also  claimed  that  cultural  factors,  teachers' experiences, and students' backgrounds might play a role in the difficulties of students being selfdirected  in  their  learning.  Meanwhile,  Guglielmino  and  Guglielmino  (2002)  from  their  study identified eight factors to be considered ready to pursue self-directed learning; they are open to learning, self-concept as an effective learner, initiative and independence in learning, acceptance of responsibility, love of learning, creativity, future orientation, and learning skills. However, these factors were too general, so they could not identify specific factors influencing SDL compared to learning. Therefore, this study examines factors that could help improve the rate of students' selfdirectedness in learning by providing a guided learning method in teaching first-semester firstyear students in a public university in Malaysia.

## 2.2 SECI Model

Learning is creating new knowledge, skills, attitudes, and values. Nonaka and Takeuchi (1995) introduced  a  model  that  explained  how  new  knowledge  is  created,  known  as  SECI  Model (Socialization, Externalization, Combination, and Internalization). Nonaka and Takeuchi's (1995) model were built on Polanyi's (1966) work, which classified knowledge into tacit and explicit. Explicit knowledge is knowledge that is in tangible forms: visible, documented, quantifiable, and

measured (Nonaka &amp; Takeuchi, 1995). Tacit knowledge is personal knowledge ingrained inside the individuals that reside within the individuals; intangible and invisible that grows based on cumulative life experiences (Nonaka &amp; Takeuchi, 1995), and it is not easy to make it tangible and shared (Cross et al., 2001).

Nonaka  and  Takeuchi's  (1995)  model  explains  that  knowledge  is  created  through  interactions among individuals with different types and contents of knowledge. Knowledge is created through the interactions that enable the transfer, conversion, and transformation between tacit and explicit knowledge. According to Nonaka and Takeuchi (1995), the reciprocal interaction between explicit and tacit knowledge is the key to understanding the knowledge-creating process.

The conversion of tacit and explicit knowledge will create new knowledge in the form of a new meaning, quantity, quality, and shape (Nonaka, 1991; Nonaka, 1994; Nonaka &amp; Takeuchi, 1995; Nonaka &amp; Toyama, 2002). The creation of new knowledge happens in a dynamic interaction of the four modes of knowledge conversion in the form of a spiral that gradually expands, and further, the dynamic interaction can activate a new spiral of a new creation of knowledge (Nonaka, 1994; Nonaka &amp; Takeuchi, 1995). This knowledge conversion goes through the spiral of Socialization, Externalization,  Combination,  and  Internalization  (Nonaka,  1994;  Nonaka  &amp;  Krogh,  2009; Nonaka &amp; Takeuchi, 1995; Nonaka &amp; Toyama, 2002; Easa &amp; Fincham, 2012).

Socialisation ,  this  process  explains how knowledge is converted from tacit knowledge to tacit knowledge.  Socialisation  happens  when  knowledge  is  passed  on  through  interaction,  sharing experiences, teamwork, attachment, or internship, and this happens through daily social interaction (Easa &amp; Fincham, 2012; Hall &amp; Andriani, 2003; Nonaka &amp; Takeuchi, 1995). Socialisation takes place where tacit knowledge such as mental models, beliefs, and the world view can be created and shared through interaction with customers, suppliers, and between entrepreneurs. Since tacit knowledge is difficult to formalise, it can be acquired solely through shared direct interaction or experience. For example, knowledge of how to socialise in the university can be transferred and converted to junior students by learning from their seniors' tacit knowledge. Knowledge transfer will be more efficient through observation and conversation than reading books or manuals. One of the most critical processes in knowledge transfer and conversion is socialisation.

Externalisation , this process explains how tacit knowledge is converted into explicit knowledge (Easa  &amp;  Fincham,  2012;  Hall  &amp;  Andriani,  2003;  Nonaka  &amp;  Takeuchi,  1995).  Externalisation concerns  making  an  internal  understanding,  that  is,  tacit  to  more  quantifiable  or  tangible knowledge, for example, manuals, formulas, or documents. Tacit knowledge is cultivated over the years within someone; once it is 'crystallised' and externalised, it can be disseminated quickly through the organisation and become a source of knowledge for other people (Nonaka, Toyama, &amp; Nagata, 2000). Externalisation happened in documentation, physical demonstration, images, recording, formulas, or brainstorming that documented. This knowledge can be shared with others as the basis for new knowledge. Tacit knowledge of a person is made explicit and synthesised through notes taking and dialogues among individuals. For example, an expert develops manuals based on his/her practical experience so that other members can understand systematically and know what happened "if" as written in the manuals. Knowledge created from externalisation is good at disseminating knowledge about best practices, repetitive work, or processes.

Combination is  about  combining, classifying, editing, and/or converting explicit knowledge to other explicit knowledge to create new knowledge (Nonaka &amp; Takeuchi, 1995; Nonaka, Toyama, &amp; Konno, 2000). This new explicit knowledge is then disseminated, either manually or by using ICT as a source of creating new knowledge for others. For example, an annual report is a yearly organisational report to shareholders. This report resulted from combining all departments' reports and synthesising them into new explicit knowledge to provide an overall figure for the company. This annual report is new knowledge that the shareholder can use to make critical decisions. The combination occurs in creating books, journals, databases, reports, categorising and the like.

Internalisation is about transforming tangible explicit knowledge, which can be read or seen into tacit knowledge (internalise), which is intangible (Nonaka &amp; Takeuchi, 1995; Nonaka, Toyama, &amp; Konno, 2000; Sabherwal &amp;  Becerra-Fernandez,  2003).  The  internalisation  process  happens when individuals convert explicit knowledge such as SOP (standard operating procedures) into tacit  knowledge  through  action,  practice,  and  reflection  to  become  new  routines,  the  same  as learning by doing (Easa &amp; Fincham, 2012). For example, a new worker can learn to work with the organisation's  software  by  reading  the  organisational  policy  and  manuals.  After  reading  and practising several times and doing several repetitions, day by day, the explicit knowledge, policy, and  manuals  will  be  internalised  and  become  tacit  knowledge  through  continuous  practice, reflection, and simulation.

Nonaka and Konno (1998) also explain that knowledge is not created in a vacuum; it requires context or 'Ba' ('place'). Information requires a context to have meaning; once it is transferred, combined,  converted,  and  transformed,  it  becomes  knowledge  (Cross  et  al.,  2001;  Nonaka, Toyama, &amp; Konno, 2000; Nonaka, Toyama, &amp; Nagata, 2000; Nonaka &amp; Toyama, 2002). 'Ba' is the context or place where interaction occurs among  and  between individuals, teams, organisations, and the environment. It can be physical such as meeting rooms, offices, conference rooms,  or  email,  or  through  mental  such  as  shared  ideas,  experiences,  mental  models,  or  a combination (Bryceson, 2007). 'Ba' is the context where new knowledge is created from existing knowledge,  which  happens  when  new  meanings  are  given  through  interpretation  (Nonaka  &amp; Toyama, 2002).

## 3 METHODOLOGY

The instrument used for this study is the Self-Directed Learning Readiness Scale (SDLRS) by Guglielmino &amp; Guglielmino (1977). This study was carried out during the first semester for firstyear  students.  The  contention  was  to  see  if  there  was  an  increase  in  SDL  level  after  being introduced to the guided learning approach. So, the SDL level measurement is carried out twice, first in the early part of the semester (pre-intervention) and the second at the final class at the end of the semester (post-intervention). This research was carried out on first-semester students of the first year to see if there was an increase in SDL level after being introduced to the guided learning approach. The pre-intervention SDL level score will be compared to the post-intervention SDL level  score  to  see  any  improvements  in  each  student's  SDL  level.  Data  from  the  focus  group interview has also been analysed using content analysis. These 37 first-year students were included in this study. The detail of how this study was conducted is explained below:

- (a) In  the  first  week  of  the  semester,  during  the  first  class,  all  of  the  students  took  the assessment to measure the SDL level (pre-intervention test),
- (b) Starting  from  the  second  week  until  the  last  week  of  the  semester,  in  every  class,  the lecturer embedded the guided learning approach (as explained below),
- (c) At the end of the semester, the students took the assessment to measure their SDL level (post-intervention test).

## Step-by-Step Procedure Conducted:

## A. Pre-Test.

The  level  of  students'  self-directed  learning  is  measured  using  the  Self-Directed  Learning Readiness Scale (SDLRS) by Guglielmino &amp; Guglielmino (1977).

## B. The Practices of Guided Learning in Class will start with

## B1 Introduction to the topic

- · The lecturer briefly explains the topic and learning objectives to the students. After this session,  the  lecturer  asks  students'  opinions  and/or  expectations  of  the  topic,  either individually or in pairs. The lecturer encourages students to convey any related ideas, and in this session, the lecturer mentioned that all ideas presented would not be judged as right or wrong.
- · This session is essential for the lecturer to get information about students' prior knowledge about the topic, and it is also good to encourage students to express their opinions freely. At the end of this session, the lecturer will summarise the ideas from students and link them back to the learning objectives. These will help the students be aware of "what to learn."

## B2 Learning - Guiding how to learn or to be more self-directed learners

- · During  the  lecture,  the  lecturer  used  various  teaching  methods,  including  lecturing, drawing  mind  mapping,  case  study  discussion,  analysing  movies/videos/clips,  selfsearching  for  information,  and  problem-solving  in  group  work.  The  lecturer  helps  to connect  students'  previous  knowledge  with  new  knowledge  through  these  various methods. If unfamiliar terms or something are attractive in the topic, the lecturer will ask students to search for related information through the internet using their smartphones on the spot.
- · At various times lecturer also shows ways to find good learning sources from various resources such as journals, websites, e-books, and YouTube. Lecturers also encourage students to utilise learning resources available in the library, such as the inter-loan library (ILL).

## B3 Incorporate peer learning in class

Lecturers encourage students to learn from and teach others to learn new material or produce new knowledge.  Learning  from  a  peer  or  teaching  peer  has  many  advantages  as  learning becomes more fun and easier to understand due to the same language, interest, and learning tools used, and it also retains knowledge longer. After one sub-learning unit finish, the lecturer provides a topic for discussion in a small group (four to five students) for 15 minutes, and then the  group  uploads  the  result  in  eLEAP  (an  E-learning  platform  used  at  the  university)  or presents it in front of the class so that each student can learn from their peer. These learning activities will allow students to learn how their peers search for information, process it, and express it verbally or nonverbally.

## B4 Cultivating knowledge sharing

In class, the lecturer provides time and space for the students to share relevant knowledge by showing what and how he/she got them in front of the class. Appreciation like verbal praise or  giving  bonus  marks  is  intended  to  reinforce  and  cultivate  knowledge  sharing  among students.

## C. Post-test Measurement

The  level  of  students'  self-directed  learning  is  measured  using  the  Self-Directed  Learning Readiness Scale (SDLRS) by Guglielmino &amp; Guglielmino (1977).

## 4 FINDINGS AND DISCUSSION

This study found that thirty-five out of thirty-seven, or 94.59% of students, increase their SDL level at the end of the semester after they experience a guided learning approach (as shown in

Table 1). The guided learning approach has helped students to improve their self-directedness in learning. This Guided-Learning Technique provides various teaching methods that help students understand the course's objective and improve their learning skills by encouraging self-learning experiences and creating a conducive learning environment where reflective learning increases and  peer  learning  becomes  livelier  than  the  previous  learning  phase.  These  different  teaching practices act as scaffolding in improving self-directedness learning in students.

The result of this study has shown the positive effect of guided learning on students' self-directed learning levels. The result indicates that students became more initiative and encouraged to try on their learning through guided learning. Based on the constructivism theory, learning should be an active  process  for  the  students  to  learn  effectively  (Hoover,  1996),  as  individuals  construct knowledge and meaning from their experience (Bereiter, 1994). Therefore, the teacher's primary responsibility is to be a facilitator and guide, create, and maintain a collaborative problem-solving environment for students (Bada &amp; Olusegun, 2015). In the guided learning approach, the lecturer must create a conducive learning environment that encourages students to engage and actively learn. Student experience and participation in this learning environment will improve confidence and  self-efficacy  in  learning,  extending  to  other  learning  contexts,  thus  increasing  their  selfdirected learning skills.

In general, this study found that the guided learning approach helps improve the self-directedness of  first-year  students,  opens  their  horizons  to  various  learning  approaches,  and  improves  their confidence in learning due to the examples shown by the lecturer as a role model in front of the class. The guided classroom activities also improve team learning or collaborative learning skills.

By using the SECI model as lenses to analyse this situation, it is found that in the guided learning approach, knowledge conversion is easier to happen. SECI model state that knowledge is created through  interactions  among  individuals  with  different  types  and  contents  of  knowledge.  New

knowledge is created through the interactions that transfer, convert, and transform explicit and tacit knowledge (Nonaka &amp; Takeuchi, 1995). Through this conversion process, tacit and explicit knowledge will be transformed to create new meaning, quantity, and quality, further creating new knowledge (Nonaka, 1991; Nonaka, 1994; Nonaka &amp; Takeuchi, 1995; Nonaka &amp; Toyama, 2002).

Through  the  guided  learning  approach,  by  using  the  SECI  model  as  lenses,  it  is  found  that socialisation,  externalisation,  combination,  and  internalisation  are  nurtured.  Due  to  the  very intensive  interaction  by  watching  the  role  model,  socialisation  and  internalisation  happened. Socialisation is a knowledge conversion process where tacit knowledge is transferred/converted to tacit  knowledge.  It  is  done  when  knowledge  is  passed  on  through  guidance,  imitation,  and observation. The students can imitate the lecturer they perceive as more knowledgeable, skilful, and experienced.

Further, through guided learning, externalisation and combination are taking place by helping the students ask good questions and deliver their opinion by creating a small group discussion. The lecturer  also  helps  the  students  convert  their  tacit  knowledge  into  explicit  by  guiding  them  in writing  a  paper  or  report.  The  combination  is  about  combining,  classifying,  editing,  and/or converting explicit knowledge to other explicit knowledge to create new knowledge (Nonaka &amp; Takeuchi, 1995; Nonaka, Toyama, &amp; Konno, 2000). As well as internalisation process occurs when explicit knowledge is converted into tacit knowledge by individuals through action, practice, and  reflection  for  it  to  become  new  routines  (Easa  &amp;  Fincham,  2012).  Therefore,  knowledge conversion, in the form of socialisation, externalisation, combination, and internalisation, seems nurtured. University students must consistently capture new knowledge, transfer and/or convert it to create new knowledge and skills and make it a habit so that the spiral of knowledge conversion will be extended and initiative to enhance knowledge will take place.

Classroom interaction as a learning context can be conceptualised as a dynamic configuration of 'ba'.  Supposedly  it  is  a  good  place  for  students  to  transfer,  combine,  convert,  and  transform knowledge between lecturer and students and between students. Additionally, this study confirms the  importance  of  lecturers  being  role  models  to  their  students.  Lecturers  can  start  by  giving examples of behaviour to them, for instance, how to search for good learning resources, how to manage and use them and to be interpreted and create new knowledge. Creating an environment that could guide students to think about what, why, and how to learn, resolving problems, and taking  responsibility  for  their  learning  need  to  be  fostered  from  the  beginning  of  their  study (Knowles et al., 2012). For students to achieve self-directed learning, the lecturer, as a learning facilitator, needs to function as a scaffold for them to have learning skills and know how to learn, which will improve their initiative to learn (Du Toit-Brits, 2019).

Little (1995) points out that students' self-directed learning is the product of an interactive process, where the teacher gradually broadens the range of students' autonomy by gradually giving them more control of the content and the process of their learning. Therefore, lecturers should know they have a crucial role to play and guide their students to learn more independently. Setting a supportive  learning  climate,  providing  the  availability  of  resources,  and  establishing  fluent communication could  enhance  the  tendency  for  self-directed  learning  to  emerge  (Kops,  1993, 1997).

More importantly, students are prone to feel pressure from their surroundings, especially when they  are  in  a  new  environment  (being  first-year  students),  which  can  lead  them  to  develop psychological  problems,  such  as  stress,  anxiety,  and  depression.  University  students  are  more likely to experience hardship at this education level which makes them need positive interventions such as gratitude to increase their psychological well-being (Dorkas Ping Bilong et al., 2021) and resilience (Nailah Najwa Zainoodin et al., 2021). Hence, this gives more reason for teachers and lecturers  to  guide  their  students,  especially  first-year  students,  to  learn  to  study  independently starting their first year of university. Developing self-directed learning skills early in students will help  them  with  their  academic  performance  and  autonomy,  as  studies  have  found  that  highachiever students tend to have high scores for all the dimensions of SDLRS (Abraham et al., 2011; Nordin et al., 2016). Therefore, this may suggest that students with a higher level of self-directed learning skills may learn more effectively than students with a lower level of self-directed learning skills.

This study from the Asia context convinces us that we should not assume that once students enter university, they will immediately be self-directed learners and be more independent. They need some role model in their life to learn how to be more self-directed in learning. This study showed that guided learning practice in class positively equips students with learning skills and builds confidence for students to research things they do not know or know little about and do deep learning. Thus, it can be concluded that self-directed learning in students can be increased through guided learning by lecturers.

## 5 CONCLUSION

This  study  proves  that  implementing  guided  learning  for  first  semester  first-year  students  has helped students develop self-directed learning skills. This study corroborates previous studies that first-year university students at the university level tend to have a teacher-centred approach to learning. This study identified that students still need guidance and role models in their learning.

Using the SECI model as lenses in analysing the impact of the guided learning approach, it is found that the knowledge transfers and converts from lecturer to students and among the students in the form  of  socialisation,  externalisation,  combination,  and  internalisation,  improving  the  selfdirectedness  among  the  students.  Rich  interactions,  like  role  models,  demonstrators,  and facilitators in group activities, are scaffolding in leveraging the students' confidence and initiative in their learning.

It is recommended for university management consider the importance of implementing guided learning as scaffolding for the students to move away gradually, be more self-directed in their learning,  and  further  achieve  their  learning  goals.  Therefore,  university  management  needs  to equip their lecturer with the skills to provide guided learning to their students. By providing a guided learning program for the students, it will help them (a) to improve their ability to set their learning objectives, (b) gain a better understanding of their strengths and limitations to be able to identify the most appropriate learning method for them, and (c) improve their learning monitoring skills.
