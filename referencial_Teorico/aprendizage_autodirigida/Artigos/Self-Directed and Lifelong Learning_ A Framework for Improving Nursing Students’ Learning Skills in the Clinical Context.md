1 Nursing Department, Taif University, Taif, Saudi Arabia, E-mail: m.motairy@gmail.com

## Abstract:

Self-directed lifelong learning is an important competency for nursing students to meet their professional development, yet it can be challenging for some students to acquire self-directed learning skills in a clinical context. A framework based on Hiemstra and Brockett s ' ' Person, Process, Context ' model was developed to promote nurses' self-directed lifelong learning. The implication stems from our expectation that the framework can accelerate the development of interpersonal and intellectual skills valuable to a nursing student s lifelong learning ' process.

## Introduction

Self-directed lifelong learning is an important competency that nurses must acquire during their undergraduate study as healthcare organizations expect nurses to take responsibility for their own professional development to achieve excellence in clinical practice.

## Background

Throughout the past few decades, self-directed learning has emerged as an important concept in the education of nurses (Qalehsari, Khaghanizadeh, &amp; Ebadi, 2017). The interest stems from the fact that self-directed learning improves the quality of care (Holmboe, Prince, &amp; Green, 2005). If students gain the skills of self-directed learning, there will be a reduced need for continuous medical education and if these skills are not learned, it might reduce patient care quality (Qalehsari et al., 2017). Indeed, through self-directed learning skills, nurses keep up to date and this has the potential to make nurses more fit to practice, leading perhaps to better patient care.

It is important to understand what self-directed learning is, what it involves, and how it can be enhanced. Self-directed learning can be described as an active process in which students take the initiative for their own learning, with or without the assistance of educators (Qalehsari et al., 2017). The definition emphasizes how selfdirected learning strategies empower students to actively search for, analyze, understand and use information to meet their own learning needs, with the educators working as facilitators in carrying out the learning objectives. This suggests that self-directed learning is the responsibility of the learner (person) but it also does not suggest that self-directed learning is a merely learner role. The process of self-directed learning is influenced by both learner (person) and context (Berkhout, Helmich, Teunissen, van der Vleuten, &amp; Jaarsma, 2018).

Brockett &amp; Hiemstra initially developed theories of self-directed lifelong learning with two dimensions: selfdirected learning process and person attributes (Hiemstra &amp; Brockett, 2012). The process involves the teachinglearning transaction, learning skills, learning styles, and evaluating abilities … ; and person attributes refer to the ' characteristics of the individual, ' such as ' creativity, critical reflection, enthusiasm, motivation … ' (Hiemstra &amp; Brockett, 2012, p 158).  Hiemstra and Brockett (2012) admitted that the two dimensions ' model underestimated the effect of context on self-directed lifelong learning, consequently, they proposed a ' Person, Process, Context ' model (PPC model) in which the three elements are equally important. The PPC model is

an extension of their earlier model, combined with years of research work in self-directed lifelong learning literature (Berkhout et al., 2018). The aim is to highlight the context, which was not fully appreciated in the previous model, as important element in understanding self-directed lifelong learning.

Context may include people involved in the learning process (e. g. student and educator), their interactions and interpersonal relationships, the learning techniques, the physical environment (e. g. classroom and laboratory) in which learning takes place. Berkhout et al. (2018) claim that context is dynamic and can be interpreted differently by learners. For instance, being alone without direct supervision in clinical placement might be seen by some students as an opportunity to independently apply and practice their learned skills. By contrast, other students might see it as limiting their chance to learn because there is no instructor to provide feedback, which is one of their learning strategies in a clinical placement. Context also entails utilizing technology. Researchers generally tend to agree that technology has a direct positive impact on students ' interaction, interpersonal relationships and engagement in the process of learning (Rashid &amp; Asghar, 2016). Although technology is a powerful tool that can expand students ' learning experiences through enhancing their abilities to retrieve and share information (Fahnoe &amp; Mishra, 2013, March), it has not been formally included in the curriculum (Alsuraihi, Almaqati, Abughanim, &amp; Jastaniah, 2016; Rung, Warnke, &amp; Mattheos, 2014). It seems that educators have ignored the fact that students are no longer those students who were formerly taught with the traditional methods (Brandon &amp; All, 2010; Candela, Dalley, &amp; Benzel-Lindley, 2006).

Enhancing the development of self-directed lifelong learning strategies necessitates equipping students with needed intellectual skills to continue learning beyond the end of their formal education (Candy, 1991). Based on Brockett and Hiemstra model (2018), query-based learning approaches, which highlight learning as being a self-directed, collaborative and contextual, is appropriate  (Sayyah, Shirbandi, Saki-Malehi, &amp; Rahim, 2017). In query-based learning , the student works to understand an open-ended problem and applies cumulative knowledge to solve the problem (Sayyah et al., 2017; Stone, Cooper, &amp; Cant, 2013). The approach requires context to build coherent argumentative dialogues in which students make claims and support their claims with evidence. This places students as active information seekers. The argumentative dialogue helps students think and reflect upon their actions, e. g. ' why they do what they do ' and decisions ' why they make that particular decision ' (Walker, 2003). This type of questioning technique builds confidence in students and decreases students ' anxiety (Stone et al., 2013). It triggers students ' curiosity and reinforces their ability to use a set of cognition skills that are critical to their lifelong learning (Dinkins, 2015). Researchers tend to agree that argumentation is collaborative in nature (Dinkins, 2015) and that learning takes place through collaborative interactions (Palincsar, 1998). Collaborative learning within pedagogical activity has been gaining attention recently (Loes &amp; Pascarella, 2017). Studies on collaborative learning show that the approach enhances students ' critical thinking and skills acquisition (Loes &amp; Pascarella, 2017), and it can be utilized to teach large numbers of students with less clinical instructor involvement (Stone et al., 2013). Thus, collaborative learning can manage some challenges facing those involved in clinical placement.

Nursing schools have improved teaching methods to actively engage students in the learning process within classroom contexts (Sayyah et al., 2017). By contrast, little is known about how to further enhance self-directed learning skills in clinical settings (Li, Paterniti, &amp; West, 2010; Qalehsari et al., 2017). This is significant since a major part of nursing education occurs in authentic clinical setting. The clinical placement experience has distinctive features not found in classroom or other contexts. Indeed, teaching and learning in a clinical practice is much more complex. Learning takes place by engaging in activities relating to patient care in which nursing students are required to constantly care for patients, with each case having different treatment needs. Therefore, learning is shaped by the interactions of the students within the varying clinical contexts. Yet, not all students have self-directed learning skills to operate in varying clinical contexts. The need for additional rigorous research on how to develop self-directed learning skills during clinical practice is obvious (Li et al., 2010; Qalehsari et al., 2017), but the challenge is how to evaluate this construct. Perhaps underpinning the evaluation approach with Hiemstra and Brocketts (2012) model of self-directed lifelong learning, will offer a useful evaluation method.

In medical education, many researchers have used PPC model to study self-directed lifelong (Sawatsky, Ratelle, Bonnes, Egginton, &amp; Beckman, 2017), however, to our knowledge, in nursing education, no comprehensive model of self-directed lifelong learning -which incorporates process, person, and context -currently exist. Hence, using Hiemstra and Brocketts (2012) model of self-directed lifelong learning, this study sought to identify if the current clinical placement at the Nursing Department of a Saudi University helps students to be self-directed lifelong learners. The resulting data became the basis of the development of a framework for improving students ' lifelong learning skills during clinical placement.

## Methods

## Studydesign

In this study, the case study methodology was utilized to describe the current clinical training in nursing program. A case study is appropriate when the investigator wants to fully understand a particular phenomenon (Baxter &amp; Jack, 2008) that must be described and illustrated. Case study inquiry is only successful when built on the collection and analysis of data from multiple sources (Yin, 2003). Triangulation of all data leads to understanding of the case.

## Setting and participants

The current project was carried out in 2017 in the Nursing Department of a Saudi University. The Nursing Department consisted of twelve lecturers, and four clinical instructors. All the lecturers and two of the clinical instructors were from the Middle East and the other two were of East Asian descent. It is worth noting here that the clinical instructors are clinically experienced Registered Nurses (RNs) who are employed by the Faculty and eventually become Faculty members. The students were all Saudi, and had multiple levels of academic performance. The nursing program is a free-of-charge four-year baccalaureate program and is comprised of eight levels. In Levels One and Two students study introductory courses and in Levels Three and Four students have laboratory-based training. Only at Level Five do students start their clinical placement and they are considered as beginning learners. Therefore, data was collected from Level Six. Level Six included 76 students (41 female and 35 male) between the ages of 19 -21. During clinical placements, the students were divided into groups ranging from 10 -12 students. The average weekly clinical hours for each student was eight (8) hours per week.

## Datacollection

The data was collected through multiple observations of clinical placements using field notes, records auditing and interview. The data that resulted from these methods were qualitative. Table 1 provides a holistic picture of how data were collected, and analyzed in this study.

Table 1: Data collection plan.

| Source               | Collecting method   | Type of data   | Analyzing method   |
|----------------------|---------------------|----------------|--------------------|
| Clinical placement   | Field notes         | textual        | Content analysis   |
| Student assignments  | Auditing            | textual        | Content analysis   |
| Clinical instructors | Interviewing        | textual        | Content analysis   |

## Field observation

This study involved unstructured observations in which the author observed and recorded students ' clinical activities for 60 minutes, once for each clinical placement group. The observations were made at any time during the beginning, middle, and end of the clinical placement day. During each of the 60 minute periods the author recorded the students ' activities and behavior, clinical instructor behavior, students ' interaction with the clinical environment, using field notes.

## Records auditing

Asample of the students ' clinical assignments were randomly selected and checked for originality using iThenticate program. The originality reports that were generated from the program were reviewed for identifying patterns. The data that resulted from the auditing process were discussed with the clinical instructors during the interview phase. Discussions helped in supporting the data.

## Interviewing

Unstructured interviews were conducted with the four clinical instructors whose activities within the students ' clinical placement was observed. The interview aimed to analyze how clinical instructors perceive the students ' behavior, performance, and interaction with the clinical environment.

## Ethical considerations

The work began from an interest of the author to carry out an academic intervention plan designed to repair areas of concern related to self-directed learning. Ethical approval was granted for this study from the research committee at the university. Informed consent was taken from all the participants before the data collection. The privacy and confidentiality of the data were considered as the data were collected and manipulated anonymously.

## Contentanalysis

Data collected during this study were in the form of narrative text. In order to explain and describe teaching and learning in clinical placement, an inductive content analysis approach was utilized to analyze the narrative text (Elo &amp; Kyngäs, 2008).

The content analysis process involves coding, categorizing and forming themes. Coding was done by writing notes and headings in the text while reading and rereading the written material. Similar codes were then grouped. Preliminary categories were merged to form more abstract ones. The purpose of creating categories is to increase understanding of the phenomenon and generate meaning. Finally, the study themes were generated.

## Trustworthiness

The credibility and confirmability of the study findings were obtained using external peer checking. To do so, findings were checked with an experienced qualitative researcher. The researcher approved the results and gave some useful suggestions. Meanwhile, dependability of the findings was obtained through precise documentation of the steps of the study.

## Results

## Field notes

The analysis of field notes revealed that students were seldom given autonomy in clinical practice. For example, students could not choose independently the case or the sequence and the amount of time invested in the clinical case. It was noticed that training was conducted in a ways that do not encourage them to learn by themselves. Further, the analysis of field notes revealed that some students never asked questions or sought answers when they were unsure about something. Some students were not able to answer challenging question, no matter howimportant the question. The engagement level was insufficient. However, they were good at answering the non-challenging questions that did not require thought. Even in the practicing phase of the psychomotor skills, it was difficult to arouse their interest. Indeed, they seldom took the initiative to practice their learned skills.

## Records auditing

Thirty-six originality reports were audited. The analysis of originality reports showed that the similarities score ranged from 21 % to 86 %. Nursing, diagnosis, interventions and outcomes were found to be the most copied sections. Matches were linked to internet sites.

## Interview

Analysis of the data revealed four themes that describe the current clinical placement status: limited time for direct observation and training, dependent learners, unintentional plagiarism and lack of motivation.

Theme 1: ' Limited time for direct observation and giving feedback '

All instructors expressed their concern that the limited time in clinical placement might have impacted the student s opportunity to learn. In this regard, some expressed concern that teaching was not always optimal for ' students because of the many teaching tasks and the limited timeframe. Some clinical instructors also reported that they may have had insufficient time to apply direct supervision or obtain feedback. Clinical instructors ' concerns were as follows:

- ' … ' . We keep running here and there . ' ' Teaching . ' ' Supervising . ' ' Explaining . ' ' Evaluating . ' ' Paper work . ' ' No time to set with all the students to reflect on their practice because tasks aren t going to get done ..' ' '

## Theme 2: ' Dependent learners '

Almost all instructors reported that students were instructed to attend procedures with staff nurses if their clinical instructor was busy elsewhere. Students were advised to discuss their observations and feedback with the instructors later or at the end of the practice day. However, many students failed to take this step and waited for the instructors to tell them what to do and when. They viewed the clinical instructor as the definitive and the only source of knowledge. Instructors made many comments in this regard, such as the following:

- '..'They (students) depend on me for their training and I need to take that into account' … . 'they always wait for me to explain things to them' … '

## Theme 3: Unintentional plagiarism

Clinical instructors reported that they found many students´ assignments such as nursing care plans (NCP) to be copied from references. The analysis of students´ NCPs originality reports confirmed this finding. This issue has been raised several times during course coordinators and clinical instructors ' meetings. Most clinical instructors commented as follows:

- '.. I know they (students) copy information' ' … . 'they had no desire to work hard . ' ' Copying from the internet is easy. ' … 'maybe they (students) are not confident about their own thoughts ...' '

## Theme 4: Lack of motivation

Clinical instructors reported that they found many students are not interested in answering challenging questions and they get tired of answering too many questions. They passively receive information. The analysis of field notes confirmed this finding. An example of clinical instructors ' comments were as follows

… it is habit … I believe this (giving them the information they need) has decreased their willingness to search for information . '

## Integration of the study results

The results clearly indicated that, in this University, the current clinical placement does not help nursing students to be self-directed lifelong learners. The study used Hiemstra and Brocketts (2012) ' Person, Process, Context ' model as a theoretical lens to guide the final analysis. As shown in Table 2, the integration of the study results has identified three main barriers to self-directed learning among nursing students. To build upon existing evidence and develop a framework for nursing students self-directed learning, active-learning literature was comprehensively searched for evidence-based teaching and learning methods. The author has experience in searching literature for evidence.  The combination of Hiemstra and Brockett's (2012) model and active learning approaches were used to develop a framework to encourage self-directed learning among nursing students. The framework was then presented and discussed in one of the nursing department meetings. Academic staff were given the chance to discuss the framework and make comments. Academic staff approved the framework and suggested minor changes. It was an iterative and reflexive process as the framework was reviewed, modified and approved. The following section will discuss the proposed framework.

## AFrameworkforimprovingstudents self-directed learning '

Based on active learning literature and guided by Hiemstra and Brockett's (2012), the author proposes an Active Clinical Training Approach (ACTA) for nurses self-directed lifelong learning. The idea of ACTA focuses on learners who must construct knowledge to learn effectively. ACTA connects the process of generating new knowledgetothe social activities within clinical context, with an emphasis on student's personal attributes. This connectedness supports the formation of interpersonal and mental models to develop self-directed learning habits (Yew &amp; Goh, 2016).

## ACTAFramework

ACTA of self-directed learning in nursing education is built upon Hiemstra and Brocketts (2012) elements and the pedagogical activities for active learning. ACTA includes aspects of process, context and person in which each element presented in the framework has a set of active learning strategies and skills for the formal process of self-directed learning. The framework focuses specifically on the influence of ACTA's implementation on students ' development of self-directed learning skills in clinical context.

(1) Creating ' back and forth ' teaching/learning process. The process begins when a patient case study exposes students to challenges, with queries and opportunities to problem solve (Holden, Rivera-Rodriguez, Faye, Scanlon, &amp; Karsh, 2013). A case study is an inquiry based modality that can trigger the process of learning (McLean, 2016). It is an active-learning strategy that can help students develop critical thinking and problem solving skills while increasing their knowledge and confidence (Brandon &amp; All, 2010). In a clinical context, problem solving is defined as the process of exploring of a problem to reach a solution and identifying learning opportunities that appear in the process of reaching the solution. Problem solving is a critical soft skill in medical education (Ibrahim, Al-Shahrani, Abdalla, Abubaker, &amp; Mohamed, 2018) and is a knowledge intensive process. During such a process, knowledge is continuously stored, retrieved, related, organized, analyzed, modified and used, to generate new knowledge (Whalen &amp; Samaddar, 2004). Processing information makes knowledge meaningful so that new knowledge could be developed (Yilmaz, 2011). Problem solving is an interactive learning process that enhance the development of self-directed learning skills (Yew &amp; Goh, 2016). On the one hand, problem-solving allows students to handle the challenges in order to answer the queries (Burns, Beauchesne, Ryan-Krause, &amp; Sawin, 2006). On the other hand, through the argumentative dialogues, students will have the opportunities to critically solve a problem, provide evidence and receive feedback. Hence, it is a dynamic process that change as the learning context change.

(2) Active confident learner. The person aspect, which includes confidence and becoming autonomous, can be enhanced through interaction and collaboration . Collaboration is a positive, confidence-building social activity. Interaction builds up an active, self-conscious and autonomous student attitude, supported by interactive relationships within the social context. Interaction and collaboration between students ' groups can increase students ' self-efficacy (Pålsson, Mårtensson, Swenne, Ädel, &amp; Engström, 2017). Self-efficacy refers to one s own ' feeling when performing tasks. High self-efficacy in the nursing context refers to the feeling of confidence to manage clinical context challenges.

(3) Active training methods. The educator needs to adopt appropriate training techniques to ensure interactive learning context. This can be achieved through using ' Socratic Technique. Within the patient case study, students interact with the educator, who becomes the facilitator. Meanwhile, problem solving serves as an important anchor for the students ' interaction with the clinical environment. Further, the social interaction with colleagues, patients and the health care team enables knowledge to be transferred from one individual to another (Loes &amp; Pascarella, 2017). Sharing and reviewing information is a kind of collaborative, brainstorming exercise between colleagues with mutual benefits.

## Application of ACTA

ACTA can be easily applied into clinical settings. To assure that standardized expectations are met, the clinical instructor collaborates with the course coordinator to integrate ACTA prior to the clinical rotation. The primary expectation is that students will actively participate in the learning experience. The application of ACTA is composedofsix steps. (i) the student selects a patient case; (ii) the student collects information about the patient. This can be achieved through using patients ' records, textbooks, journals, and technology. The technology such as smartphone and tablets allows students to have online access to the most recent scientific evidence of nursing practice (Jebraeily, Fazlollahi, &amp; Rahimi, 2017). However, to prevent the negative impact of technology on the training experience, it is important to identify when and for how long the smartphones and tablets should

be used (Wu et al., 2013); (iii) the student is then encouraged to write a short outline or brief report detailing the signs and symptoms, diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of the patient case; (iv) and to briefly present the patient case to the clinical instructor; (v), during the presentation, the student is cognitively challenged to provide supporting information to defend their findings. For example:

The student identifies a health problem and the clinical instructor may state, ' What do you think? ' The clinical instructor may continue to probe for further information by asking the student a question such as, ' What led you to that assumption? ' This kind of argumentative dialogue enhances critical thinking abilities that will help them learn the strategies to become lifelong learners (Walker, 2003). It further, allows the instructor to correct any misconceptions that the student may have and to assess the students ' intellectual abilities to transfer previous knowledge into a new situation,

(vi) the students will then have post-conferences in which the student takes the lead, sharing the information with their colleagues. A student chooses the style of presentation and leads the group discussion in the active learning exercise. Once sufficient engagement is demonstrated, students can be trusted to perform tasks with distance supervision or without direct supervision (Berkhout et al., 2018). Trust is likely to nourish feelings of autonomy (Berkhout et al., 2018). The above mentioned six steps of the ACTA application, promote students ' interaction in the clinical practice and provide opportunities to learn and share knowledge.

## Discussion

The current study was aimed at identifying if the current clinical placement at the Nursing Department of a Saudi University enhance students autonomy to be self-directed lifelong learners. Several issues were identified ' that can adversely affect students ' self-directed lifelong learning in a clinical context. These issues are consistent with those found in the literature. For instance, although providing direct observation and giving feedback are essential components of the learning process in health professions (Gordon, 2003) studies found that little time is spent conducting direct observation and training during clinical placements (Smith et al., 2017). In fact, students are rarely observed or assessed doing certain important clinical tasks (Smith et al., 2017). Giving feedback helps in identifying clinical deficiencies and increases learners ' confidence and competence both of which are important in student nurses´ lifelong learning (Qalehsari et al., 2017).

' Dependent or passive learners ' was another learning issue raised in the present study. This is understandable because many of students ' in their early years of education were likely to be in a typically Middle Eastern teacher centered learning culture (Filatova, 2015), and students have adjusted their own learning strategies to this. They know the importance of self-directed learning but due to a lack of the required skills to manage their own learning, students struggle in this regard.

The medical profession in general and nursing in particular is a profession where ethics are vital (Smedley, Crawford, &amp; Cloete, 2015). Students may not be aware that copying information from a website is considered plagiarism. Indeed, a study conducted by Kim, and his colleagues (2016) found that 62 % of medical students included in a study copied their assignment from different resources and these students were not aware that they had plagiarized. Self-directed learning might reduce plagiarism as students work on an authentic health problems of their own finding.

One desired outcome from the undergraduate nursing program is a nurse who has a self-directed learning style. However, the outcomes of self-directed lifelong learning are greatly affected by the motivation of the learner and this can only be achieved through intrinsic motivation (Bodkyn &amp; Stevens, 2015). Intrinsic motivation needs psychological traits such as autonomy and a feeling of competence (Berkhout et al., 2018, p 39). Thus, the challenge for the nursing educators is to foster the development of self-directed lifelong learning skills so that students may become responsible and autonomous learners.

The application of ACTA is expected to accelerate the development of both intellectual and cognitive skills and the ability to learn opportunistically. These skills are necessary to self-directed lifelong learning and will allow students to develop competencies leading to the enhancement of autonomy. Several studies have emphasized that nursing students need to feel like a nurse in a clinical context (Dinkins, 2015).

Despite the change in nursing education, many nursing educators continue to view themselves as the main player of teaching and the primary transmitters of knowledge in the clinical sites (Brandon &amp; All, 2010; Candela et al., 2006). Clinical instructors must be capable to equip nursing students with the skills required to be independent learners. A fundamental challenge is transforming students from passive to active participants in a collaborative learning environment. This can be only achieved through changing the control of learning from educator to the student. Educators who practice quality improvement and explore approaches that enhance self-directed learning such as case studies, problem solving, and collaborative learning can overcome the challenges of the teaching-learning process. Collaboration between courses coordinators and clinical instructors to

develop teaching and training to institute best practices for actively engaging students is an important step in the reform of nursing students clinical training for nursing students.

Preparing students to be self-directed learners and autonomous actors, to care for patients in complex environments where things tend to go wrong if not intelligently adjusted is essential (Habimana, Tuyizere, &amp; Uwajeneza, 2016). Skills such as communication, problem solving and critical thinking, social interaction are fostered by ACTA. For instance, the interaction of students with patients/relatives, healthcare providers and clinical instructors, can improve communication skills. Searching for information independently and taking the initiative to participate in clinical activities on the ward can assist in developing lifelong learning skills. Involving students in an argumentative discussion helps students to develop problem solving and critical thinking skills. Further, involving students with peer-discussion and obtaining peer-feedback will allow students to gain social skills that will support their success in practicing nursing and maintaining patient safety (Barton, 2009). Using smart mobile devices allows students to practice the use of technology resources, a tool that is becoming valuable to the contribution in improving the quality of care (Vafa &amp; Chico, 2013).

## Studylimitation

The study has several limitations. Interviews with more clinical instructors would provide more validity and reliability in the findings. An important key limitation is that we did not interviewed nursing students, however we observed the students ' activities and behavior and their interaction with clinical instructors.

## Conclusion

There is agreement that a critical component of being a qualified nurse is to have self-directed learning skills. Therefore, if these skills are to be fostered in the clinical context, undergraduate nursing training programs must enhance the development of both intellectual skills and the ability to learn opportunistically. ACTA may accelerate the development of skills valuable to a nursing student s lifelong practice. Under this approach, ' training will enhance students´ ability to take advantage of practice opportunities, apply inquiry techniques, construct meaningful conclusions and demonstrate understanding of concepts. The approach therefore instills a sense of responsibility in nursing students for their own learning.
