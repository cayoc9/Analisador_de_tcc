Jeral R. Kirwan , John W. Lounsbury , and Lucy W. Gibson 1 1 2

## Abstract

The present study addresses the relationship between learner self-direction and other personality traits of college students when  the  traits  represented  by  the  five-factor  model  of  personality  are  differentiated  from  narrow  personality  traits. Correlation and multiple regression analyses were used with a sample of 2,102 college students to examine the unique individual relationship between Big Five and narrow personality traits and learner self-direction. Analysis of the data revealed five significant part correlations between specific traits and learner self-direction. The part correlations for Work Drive (.310) and Openness (.207) were significantly higher than all other part correlations. Neither Conscientiousness nor Agreeableness had significant part correlations despite having significant zero-order correlations with learner self-direction. Extroversion did not have a significant zero-order correlation with learner self-direction but the part correlation was significant. Results were discussed in terms of the predictive relationship between personality variables and learner self-direction. Study implications, some limitations, and possible directions for future research were noted.

## Introduction

Self-direction in learning has been a major topic in the field of adult learning for many years, with extensive coverage of the  topic  by  theorists,  researchers,  and  practitioners  (e.g., Brockett &amp; Hiemstra, 1991; Long &amp; Redding, 1991). Long (2007) has identified several themes and measures of selfdirection in learning that have focused on psychological factors.  Several  empirical  measures  have  been  developed  to measure different  dimensions  of  self-direction  in  learning, which include psychological factors such as the Self-Directed Learning Readiness Scale (SDLRS; Guglielmino, 1977), the Oddi Continuing Learning Inventory (OCLI;  Oddi,  1984), and more recently the Personal Responsibility Orientation to Self-Direction in Learning Scale (PRO-SDLS; Stockdale &amp; Brockett, 2011). It has been shown that many psychological variables  are  directly  related  to  learner  self-directedness (Oliveira  &amp;  Simões,  2006).  However,  there  is  a  dearth  of empirical  research  that  explores  learner  self-direction  specifically as a personality trait. If personality traits are relatively consistent for learners across situations and over time, and  if  learner  self-direction  changes  across  situations  and over time, the most logical interpretation of why the personality trait-learner self-direction relationship is relatively consistent within and across disparate factors such as age and returning to college after a long break is because the personality traits are driving the relationship. This implies that other personality traits are affecting learner self-direction, not that learner self-direction is influencing other personality traits.

Previous research on broad and narrow personality traits in relation to learner self-direction has focused on either (a) bivariate correlations between  the  personality  trait and learner self-direction or (b) the total variance in learner selfdirection accounted for by Big Five or narrow traits. Because of some degree of multicollinearity of the Big Five and narrow traits, in neither of the above cases do we know what is the  unique  relationship  between  the  personality  traits  and learner  self-direction  or  the  unique  amount  of  variance  in learner self-direction accounted for by the personality trait. Thus, for example, we cannot say what is the unique or independent  relationship  between  Openness  and  learner  selfdirection after controlling for the influence of the other Big Five and narrow traits in relation to learner self-direction. To better understand how learner self-direction is related to each of the Big Five and narrow traits in their own right, without the  added  association  or  influence  of  the  other  traits,  the

present  study  investigates  the  part  correlation  (which  has also been termed the semi-partial correlation ) between each personality  trait  and  learner  self-direction  after  controlling for the other Big Five and narrow traits.

## Purpose and Significance

The goal of the present study is to try understand the connection between personality and self-direction in learning and ascertain  to  what  extent  individual  personality  traits  are related to learner self-direction when the traits represented by the five-factor model of personality (Digman, 1990) are differentiated  from  narrow  personality  traits. This  study  is directly based on and extends the work of Lounsbury, Levy, Park, Gibson, and Smith (2009) and Kirwan, Lounsbury, and Gibson (2010). The present study differs from the previous two  studies  in  that  it  examines  the  unique  relationship  of individual  traits  to  learner  self-direction  and  their  relative importance in accounting for variation in learner self-direction.

The significance of this study is to add empirical evidence to support the body of work on self-direction in learning to work  toward  a  better  understanding  of  the  relationship between personality traits and learner self-direction. While there has been much scholarly work on the area of personality  in  relation  to  self-direction,  there  are  few  quantitative studies that try and pinpoint the connection, particularly with regard  to  traits.  There  is  a  substantial  body  of  empirical research  supporting  the  idea  that  narrow  personality  traits can add significant, incremental validity to the Big Five personality traits in some settings and populations in predicting complex, real-world criteria including learner self-direction.

## Literature Review

Research regarding the characteristics of self-directed learners is somewhat fragmented and piecemeal. Several instruments  have  been  developed  to  try  and  identify  aspects  of self-direction.  Stockdale  (2003)  identified  16  instruments that  measure  some  aspect  of  self-directed  learning.  While there has been discussion of traits in relation to learner selfdirection (Brockett &amp;  Hiemstra,  1991;  Oliveira, Silva, Guglielmino, &amp; Guglielmino, 2010), and there is quite a bit of empirical  investigation  of  self-directed  learning,  the research has predominately focused on readiness for learning.

There is a fair amount of literature describing studies that include cognate constructs in relation to self-directed learning  readiness  such  as  self-regulation  and  resilience  (Nota, Salvatore,  &amp;  Zimmerman,  2004);  performance,  creativity, and problem solving (Oliveira et al., 2010); internal locus of control (Gardner &amp; Helmes, 1999; Skaggs, 1981); life satisfaction  of  elderly  individuals  (Brockett,  1985;  Gardner  &amp; Helmes, 1999); lower levels of dogmatism (Long &amp; Agyekum, 1983); affective organizational commitment (Cho &amp; Kwon, 2005); cognitive interest (Reynolds, 1986); flexi- bility  and  open-mindedness  (Oddi,  1987);  and  conscientiousness (Oliveira &amp; Simões, 2006).

There are many ideas about what the goals of self-directed learning should be (e.g., Brockett &amp;  Hiemstra, 1991; Brookfield,  1993;  Knowles,  1975;  Tough,  1971),  but  the general idea is that the learner will take the lead in the learning  process.  Garrison  (1997)  pointed  out  that  self-directed learners have a greater understanding of their responsibility for making learning meaningful and they are able to evaluate themselves.  While  there  are  many  conceptualizations  and models  for  understanding  self-directed  learning,  many  of them  are  less  comprehensive  and  directed  toward  specific situations.  It  is  important  to  be  able  to  distinguish  among learner characteristics, the learning environment/social context, and the process of self-directed learning. For this reason,  the  Personal  Responsibility  Orientation  (PRO)  model (Brockett  &amp;  Hiemstra,  1991)  was  selected  for  the  current study.

## The PRO Model

Brockett and Hiemstra (1991) developed a model to distinguish between the different aspects of self-direction in learning. The PRO model divides self-direction in learning into two distinct but related components: an instructional process during which the learner assumes primary responsibility for the planning, implementing, and evaluating the learning process (self-directed learning); and personality characteristics centering on the learner's preferences or desires for assuming responsibility for learning (learner self-direction). Selfdirection in learning involves both components intertwined within the learner's social context as he or she works toward personal responsibility for his or her learning.

Drawing on Brockett (1983), learner self-direction, in this study, is defined as a disposition to engage in learning activities where the learner takes responsibility for developing and carrying out learning endeavors in an autonomous manner without being guided or prompted by other people. Thus, the measure to be used in this study differs from other conceptualizations of self-directed learning in that it has been defined, developed, and validated as a personality trait, rather than an instructional method or readiness for learning scale.

To explore the relationship between personality traits and learner self-direction, personality will be defined, broad and narrow traits discussed, and the Big Five model and learner self-direction  introduced.  Finally,  literature  from  empirical studies  discussing  the  relationships  between  personality traits and learner self-direction will serve as an ingression to the  descriptions  of  methods,  procedures,  presentation  of findings, and discussion.

## Personality

There has long been a debate in psychology as to whether behavior is determined by situational and environmental factors or by individual factors (a behaviorist view), or whether

individual factors, such as personality, determine behavior. The situational viewpoint fails to explain behaviorally consistent inclinations many people exhibit. For example, some people are more outgoing than others, no matter the setting. Although it is unclear what the exact relationship is between the environment  and  personality,  several  theories have addressed  how  the  developmental  environment  influences personality.

Personality is commonly defined as a relatively complex set of traits that influence behavior across time and situation (Graziano &amp; Eisenberg, 1997; Zimbardo &amp; Gerrig, 1996). Trait theories became prominent in the 1980s largely due to the work of industrial/organizational psychologists (Hogan &amp; Roberts, 1996). Costa and McCrae (1985) revived interest in  the  study  of  personality with the introduction of a fivefactor taxonomy. Personality traits were being looked at in relation  to  workplace  needs  such  as  hiring  and  promotion selections.

Personality  continues  to  be  one  of  the  most  researched areas in the field of psychology. The most commonly used measure  of  personality  is  the  five-factor  model.  The  fivefactor model (often called the Big Five) has been found to be a  robust  and  broad  measure  of  normal  personality  (Tokar, Fischer, &amp; Subich, 1998), and is the most commonly used theory  for  normal  personality  (Costa  &amp;  McCrae,  1988; Digman  &amp;  Inouye,  1986;  John,  1990;  McCrae  &amp;  Costa, 1987). Numerous studies have verified the factor structure and construct validity of the Big Five constructs ( Openness, Conscientiousness, Extroversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism ; Costa &amp; McCrae, 1994). The five-factor model suggests that there are five independent factors of personality most commonly  labeled: Openness, Conscientiousness, Extroversion, Agreeableness , and Neuroticism (often referred to by the acronym OCEAN). With regard to the latter point, the Big  Five  model  of  personality  traits  of  Openness, Conscientiousness, Extroversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism (which will be referred to here by its inverseEmotional Stability) is widely accepted as a unified, parsimonious model of normal personality that has been validated in  many different cultures and across several research settings (e.g., De Raad, 2000; Digman, 1997), with supporting studies based on many different demographic and personal characteristics of individuals (Costa &amp; McCrae, 1994).

## Narrow Personality Traits

The five factor's broad descriptions of personality make it very useful. However, several researchers complain that the five-factor model is too broad, simplistic, and does not adequately analyze personality. Critics suggest that the five factors do not adequately address the wide range of personality variables and that much of the variance cannot be accounted for (Paunonen &amp; Jackson, 2000). Thus, it may be necessary to  investigate  narrow  personality  traits  as  well  to  examine how personality factors are related to a broader spectrum of personality variables McAdams (1992).

A  common  conundrum  in  studying  personality  is  that even  if  a  particular  criterion  is  strongly  associated  with  a broad trait, the scope of the trait does not necessarily lead to an understanding of the conditions surrounding the relationship. However, it may be possible to determine which relationships are due to one narrow factor or a combination of narrow  factors  under  a  broader  trait  by  looking  at  both (Paunonen, Rothstein, &amp; Jackson, 1999). When narrow traits are  included  within  a  broader  personality  dimension,  this may allow for more significant findings and a better understanding of the predictive factors and contributions of narrow traits. Therefore, for the purpose of this study, the Big Five will be utilized, and the following two narrow traits will be  considered  to  account  for  additional  variance  in  selfdirected learning. Along with the Big Five traits, two narrow traits  are  included  in  the  present  study.  Work  Drive  and Optimism were the only narrow traits chosen as they were the only two that have been consistently statistically significant in studies involving learner self-direction (Kirwan et al., 2010; Lounsbury et al., 2009).

## Learner Self-Direction

Learner self-direction in this study is examined as an individual differences variable. Consistent with prior conceptualizations of self-direction in learning (e.g., Brockett, 1983; Brockett &amp; Hiemstra, 1991; Costa &amp; Kalick, 2003), learner self-direction is conceptualized and measured as a personality trait reflecting individuals' preference to be in charge of his  or  her  learning  process;  ability  to  conceptualize,  plan, implement, and evaluate one's academic experience; and disposition to be goal-oriented and to work independently or in group settings with little guidance. For this study, the focus is on learner self-direction as an individual differences variable that  can  be  represented  on  a  continuum  from  low  to  high rather than a categorical or nominal variable. With respect to Brockett and Hiemstra's (1991) two dimension, self-direction in learning model, the learner self-direction construct in this study corresponds to their learner self-direction construct.

Below,  a  brief  rationale  is  provided  for  each  proposed relationship using a twofold approach, involving (a) a deductive,  construct-based  approach  (Barrick,  Mount,  &amp;  Gupta, 2003), which specifies how the meaning of the personality trait as construct aligns with the meaning of the learner selfdirection  construct  and  (b)  basing  the  hypothesis  on  prior research relating the personality trait to learner self-direction.

Learner self-direction and Openness. Self-directed learners are motivated  by  new  learning  in  a  non-traditional  manner, which is consistent with the construct of Openness (Costa &amp; McCrae, 1992). Individuals who score higher in learner selfdirection would be expected to score higher in Openness as one  of  the  main  expressions  of  Openness  is  learning  new material  (Lounsbury  &amp;  Gibson,  2010). Also,  Oddi  (1984)

reported a positive correlation between the OCLI and openmindedness.  In  addition,  Kirwan  et  al.  (2010)  found  that Openness was the Big Five trait most highly correlated with learner self-direction ( r = .43, p &lt; .01) and it was more highly correlated with learner self-direction than all but one of the narrow traits.

Learner self-direction and Conscientiousness. Learner selfdirection  requires  a  person  to  have  some  level  of  selfdiscipline  and  goal-directed  behavior,  which  is  consistent with the construct of Conscientiousness (Costa &amp; McCrae, 1992) because the latter measures an individual's inclination 'to  be  reliable,  trustworthy,  dependable,  orderly,  and  rulefollowing' (Lounsbury et al., 2009, p. 416). Kirwan et al. (2010)  found  a  significant  positive  correlation  between Conscientiousness and learner self-direction (  = .20, r p &lt; .01). Also, Oliveira and Simões (2006) found a statistically significant relationship between Conscientiousness and learner self-direction.

Learner self-direction and emotional stability. Self-directed learners  who  score  higher  on  this  trait  are  likely  to  have higher levels of learner self-direction because they are more focused, purposeful, as well as less distracted and emotionally  reactive,  than  traditional  learners  (i.e.,  more  teacherdirected). This relationship is understandable in that individuals who score higher on Emotional Stability tend to worry less about personal problems and insecurities and may be better able to attend to learning projects (Lounsbury et al., 2009).  Indeed,  several  studies  have  confirmed  a  positive relationship  between  learner  self-direction  and  Emotional Stability (e.g., Holmes, 2005; Lounsbury, Saudargas, &amp; Gibson, 2004).

Learner self-direction and  Agreeableness. Self-directed learners who score high on Agreeableness are inclined to be equable, participative,  helpful,  cooperative,  and  inclined  to  interact with others harmoniously. By way of rationale, more agreeable individuals  often strive for cooperation  (Costa  &amp; McCrae, 1992), which would facilitate self-directed learning in  group  settings.  Self-directed  learners  who  are  lower  on Agreeableness  are  inclined  to  be  stubborn,  argumentative, and oppositional (Costa &amp; McCrae, 1992), which could lead to lower levels of active, self-directed learning (Chen, Wang, &amp; Lin, 2006). In this vein, Kirwan et al. (2010) found a modest, positive correlation between Agreeableness and learner self-direction ( r = .21, p &lt; .01).

Learner self-direction and Extroversion. There is no evidence in prior  research  that  Extroversion  is  significantly  related  to learner  self-direction.  Due  to  this,  a  directional  hypothesis was not put forward in this study.

Learner  self-direction  and  Work  Drive. Individuals  high  in Work Drive are inclined to work hard and for long hours to complete projects, and they are motivated to extend themselves, if necessary, to finish projects, meet deadlines, attain quotas, and achieve success (Lounsbury &amp; Gibson, 2010). Accordingly, students with high levels of Work Drive may have higher levels of learner self-direction because they set challenging learning goals for themselves, exert additional effort beyond normal class expectations, and extend themselves as needed to attain their learning goals (Lounsbury, Gibson,  &amp;  Hamrick,  2004).  In  this  regard,  Kirwan  et  al. (2010)  found  that  Work  Drive  was  the  narrow  trait  most highly correlated with learner self-direction ( r = .49, p &lt; .01) and was the second highest of all the traits-including narrow and Big Five traits-after Openness.

Learner self-direction and Optimism. Individuals who are more optimistic tend to have a sanguine, hopeful outlook concerning prospects, people, and the future even in the face of difficulty and adversity. They also tend to minimize problems and  persist  in  the  face  of  setbacks  as  well  as  have  higher levels  of  achievement-related  dispositions  (Hewitt  &amp;  Gordon,  1996).  This  aligns  well  with  learner  self-direction, which is characterized by an individual being positive and open to new possibilities as well as persisting despite obstacles to achieving learning goals. Empirical support for such a relationship can be seen in Kirwan et al.'s (2010) finding of a  positive  correlation  between  Optimism  and  learner  selfdirection ( r = .31, p &lt; .01).

In determining the importance of personality in relation to learner self-direction for college age students, Big Five and narrow personality traits and learner self-direction were examined to determine the unique contribution of the relationships.

## Method

## Population and Sample

Data  from  a  convenience  sample  of  2,102  undergraduate psychology students at a large, southeastern U.S. public university  were  collected,  of  which  approximately  30%  were male (70% female). Seventy-nine percent of the participants were  freshmen;  15%  sophomores,  3%  juniors,  and  3% seniors.  Eighty-four  percent  of  the  participants  identified themselves as Caucasian; 9%  African  American, 2%, Hispanic, 2% Asian, and 3% Other.

## Procedure

After obtaining human subjects approval from the university's Institutional Review Board, participants were solicited to take a personality inventory online. Upon completion of the report, each participant was provided a feedback report summarizing  their  personality  characteristics  and  implications for a variety of areas related to being a student, including area of study, social life, managing stress, study habits, living situation, and using campus resources.

## Data Analysis

Data  analysis  included  descriptive  statistics,  correlational analysis,  and  multiple  regression  analysis  using  the  SPSS statistical package.  In  particular,  part  correlations  (also known as semi-partial correlations) were analyzed to investigate the unique contribution of individual variables.

One of the problems that come up in multiple regression is that of defining the contribution of each independent variable to the multiple correlation. There are several ways of looking ways of addressing this question how much a variable contributes to the model. One answer is provided by the part correlation sr and its square, sr 2 .

Part correlations and squared part correlations indicate the unique variance of each independent variable in relation to the dependent variable when controlling for the unique and shared variance of the other independent variables (Cohen, Cohen, West, &amp; Aiken, 2003). The squared part correlation for a variable represents how much R 2 will decrease if that variable is removed from the regression equation (Pedhazur, 1997). In other words, the squared part correlation represents the proportion of variance of the dependent variable accounted  for  by  a  given  independent  variable  above  and beyond other variables.

## Research Question and Hypotheses

Where justifiable in terms of the empirical literature, directional hypotheses were advanced; otherwise, the trait-learner self-direction relationship was examined as a non-directional research  question.  In  addition,  in  those  cases  where  prior results point toward a stronger relationship between the personality  trait  and  learner  self-direction,  hypotheses  were advanced addressing the relative strength of pairs of part correlations. For example, because of the strength of the bivariate relationship between Openness and learner self-direction, it was  hypothesized that the part correlation between Openness and learner self-direction will be higher than the corresponding  part  correlations  for  all  of  the  other  traits examined here except Work Drive.

## Big Five Traits

Hypothesis  1: Openness  will  be  uniquely,  positively related  to  learner  self-direction  after  controlling  for  the other Big Five and narrow traits.

Hypothesis  1a: The  part  correlation  for  Openness  and learner  self-direction  will  be  higher  than  all  the  corresponding part correlations for the other traits except Work Drive.

Hypothesis 2: Conscientiousness will be uniquely, positively related to learner self-direction after controlling for the other Big Five and narrow traits.

Hypothesis 3: Emotional Stability (the inverse of Neuroticism) will be uniquely, positively related to learner self-direction after controlling for the other Big Five and narrow traits.

Hypothesis 4: Agreeableness will be uniquely, positively related  to  learner  self-direction  after  controlling  for  the other Big Five and narrow traits.

Research Question 1: What is the relationship between Extroversion and learner self-direction?

## Narrow Traits

Hypothesis  5: Work  Drive  will  be  uniquely,  positively related  to  learner  self-direction  after  controlling  for  the other Big Five and narrow traits.

Hypothesis 5a: The part correlation for Work Drive and learner  self-direction  will  be  higher  than  all  the  corresponding part correlations for the other traits.

Hypothesis  6: Optimism  will  be  uniquely,  positively related  to  learner  self-direction  after  controlling  for  the other Big Five and narrow traits.

## Instrumentation

The  Big  Five  Personality  Inventory. The  personality  measure used in this study was the Resource Associates' Transition to College  inventory  (RATTC;  Lounsbury  &amp;  Gibson,  2010). The RATTC is a normal personality inventory contextualized for  late  adolescents  (Jaffe,  1998)  and  adults  through  high school and college. It measures the Big Five Traits of Openness,  Conscientiousness,  Extroversion,  Agreeableness,  and Neuroticism. The RATTC also measures the narrow traits of Aggression,  Career-Decidedness,  Optimism,  Self-Directed Learning, Sense of Identity, Tough-Mindedness, and Work Drive. Information pertaining to scale development, reliability, criterion-related validity, construct validity, and norming can be found in Kirwan et al. (2010); Lounsbury et al. (2009); Lounsbury,  Tatum,  et  al.  (2003);  Lounsbury,  Gibson,  and Hamrick (2004); and Lounsbury and Gibson (2010).

The RATTC has 118 items represented by statements in which respondents are  asked  to  express  agreement  or  disagreement on a 5-point Likert-type scale (1 = strongly disagree ,  2  = disagree ,  3  = neutral/undecided ,  4  = agree ,  5  = strongly agree ). A brief description of the personality traits measured by RATTC involved in the present study is given below (Lounsbury &amp; Gibson, 2010):

- · · Agreeableness -being agreeable, participative, helpful,  cooperative, and inclined to interact with others harmoniously (coefficient α = .77)
- · · Conscientiousnessbeing conscientious, reliable, trustworthy,  orderly,  and  rule-following  (coefficient α = .84)
- · · Emotional Stabilityoverall level of adjustment and emotional resilience in the face of stress and pressure (conceptualized as the inverse of neuroticism; coefficient α = .86)

- · · Extroversiontendency to be sociable, outgoing, gregarious, warmhearted, expressive, and talkative (coefficient α = .83)
- · · Opennessreceptivity and openness to change, innovation, new experience, and learning (coefficient α = .80)
- · · Optimismhaving  an  optimistic, hopeful  outlook concerning prospects, people, and the future, even in the face of difficulty and adversity as well as a tendency to minimize problems and persist in the face of setbacks (coefficient α = .85)
- · · Self-Directed Learninginclination to learn new materials and find answers to questions on one's own rather than relying on a teacher to provide answers; initiating and following through on learning without being  required  to  for  a  course  or  prompted  to  by  a teacher (coefficient α = .87)
- · · Work  Drivebeing  hard-working,  industrious,  and inclined to put in long hours and much time and effort to reach goals and achieve at a high level (coefficient α = .81).

The  RATTC  Self-Directed  Learning  scale. The  RATTC  SelfDirected  Learning  scale  is  a  10-item  scale  with  responses made on a 5-point Likert-type scale: 1 = strongly disagree , 2 = disagree , 3 = neutral/undecided , 4 = agree , 5 = strongly agree . It was developed as part of the larger RATTC, a system  for  measuring  personality  traits  for  adolescents  and adults (Lounsbury &amp; Gibson, 2010). The theoretical framework  for  the  Self-Directed  Learning  construct  was  based directly  on  Brockett's  (1983)  conceptualization  that  'selfdirected learning refers to activities where primary responsibility  for  planning,  carrying out, and evaluating a learning endeavor is assumed by the individual learner' (p. 16). Table 1 contains the 10 items comprising the RATTC Self-Directed Learning scale.

## Results

Pearson's product-moment correlation coefficients were calculated between learner self-direction and the Big Five traits as  well  as  narrow  traits  of  Work  Drive  and  Optimism. Descriptive statistics and intercorrelations among the study variables are displayed in Table 2.

As can be seen in Table 4, all of the Big Five personality traits are correlated significantly and positively with learner self-direction, except for Extroversion. Specifically, in descending order of magnitude, the correlations with SelfDirected Learning were as follows: Openness (  = .43, r p &lt; .01), Agreeableness (  = .21, r p &lt;  .01),  Emotional Stability ( r =  .20, p &lt;  .01),  Conscientiousness  ( r =  .20, p &lt;  .01), Extroversion (  = .01, r ns ), and the narrow personality traits also correlated significantly with learner self-direction, with the largest magnitude correlation observed for Work Drive ( r = .49, p &lt; .01), followed by Optimism (  = .31, r p &lt; .01).

The next  phase  of  the  analysis  involved  examining  the part  correlations  of  learner  self-direction  with  Openness, Conscientiousness, Extroversion, Agreeableness, Emotional Stability, Optimism, and Work Drive. A multiple regression analysis  was  conducted  with  learner  self-direction  as  the dependent variable, and the remaining variables as predictors entered simultaneously. The part correlations represent the correlations of learner self-direction with each of the predictor variables, independent of the other predictors. Thus, the squared  part  correlations  give  an  indication  of  the  unique contribution  of  each  variable  to  learner  self-direction.  An examination of the squared part correlations of the five significant  variables  indicates  that  Work  Drive  accounted  for 9.6% of the variance, Openness accounted for approximately 4.3% of the variance, Optimism accounted for almost 1% of the  variance,  and  Extroversion  and  Agreeableness  each accounted  for  less  than  1%  of  the  variance  in  learner self-direction.

Hypothesis  1: Openness  will  be  uniquely,  positively related  to  learner  self-direction  after  controlling  for  the other Big Five and narrow traits.

To  estimate  the  unique  relationship,  or  validity  coefficient,  between  Openness  and  learner  self-direction,  a  part correlation  was  calculated,  controlling  for  Agreeableness, Extroversion, Conscientiousness, Emotional Stability, Optimism, and Work Drive. Openness was significantly and positively related to learner self-direction ( sr = .207, p &lt; .01), supporting Hypothesis 1.

the  squared  part  correlations  indicates  that  when  all  other variables were controlled for, Openness accounts for more than 4% of the variance in learner self-direction.

Hypothesis  1a: The  part  correlation  for  Openness  and learner  self-direction  will  be  higher  than  all  the  corresponding part correlations for the other traits except Work Drive.

The part correlation for Openness ( sr = .21) was the second  highest  next  to  Work  Drive  ( sr =  .31)  supporting  the hypothesis.

Hypothesis 2: Conscientiousness will be uniquely, positively related to learner self-direction after controlling for the other Big Five and narrow traits.

To  estimate  the  unique  relationship,  or  validity  coefficient, between Conscientiousness and learner self-direction, a part correlation was calculated, controlling for Agreeableness, Extroversion, Openness, Emotional Stability, Optimism,  and  Work  Drive.  Conscientiousness  was  positively  but  not  significantly  related  to  learner  self-direction

( sr =  .02, p &gt;  .05),  which  does  not  support  Hypothesis  2. Table 3 shows part correlation and part correlation squared coefficients. An examination of the squared part correlations indicates that when all other variables were controlled for, Conscientiousness accounts for less than 0.1% of the variance in learner self-direction.

Hypothesis 3: Emotional Stability (the inverse of Neuroticism) will be uniquely, positively related to learner self-direction after controlling for the other Big Five and narrow traits.

To  estimate  the  unique  relationship,  or  validity  coefficient, between Emotional Stability and learner self-direction, a part correlation was calculated, controlling for Agreeableness, Extroversion, Conscientiousness, Openness, Optimism, and Work Drive. Emotional Stability was positively and significantly related to learner self-direction ( sr = .05, p &lt; .01), which supports Hypothesis 3. Table 3 shows the part correlation and part correlation squared coefficients. An examination of the squared part correlations  indicates  that when  all  other  variables  were  controlled  for,  Emotional Stability accounts for approximately 1% of the variance in learner self-direction.

Hypothesis 4: Agreeableness will be uniquely, positively related  to  learner  self-direction  after  controlling  for  the other Big Five and narrow traits.

To  estimate  the  unique  relationship,  or  validity  coefficient,  between  Agreeableness  and  learner  self-direction,  a part  correlation  was  calculated,  controlling  for  Openness, Extroversion, Conscientiousness, Emotional Stability, Optimism,  and  Work  Drive. Agreeableness  was  positively but not significantly related to learner self-direction ( sr = .03, p &gt; .05), which does not support Hypothesis 4.

when all other variables were controlled for, Agreeableness accounts  for  less  than  0.1%  of  the  variance  in  learner self-direction.

Research Question 1: What is the relationship between Extroversion and learner self-direction?

Extroversion was not significantly correlated with learner self-direction ( r = .01, ns ). However, the part correlation for Extroversion was significant at the .05 level ( sr = -.039, p &lt; .05) but only accounted for less than 1% of the variance in learner self-direction.

To estimate the unique relationship between Optimism and learner self-direction, a part correlation was calculated, controlling for Agreeableness, Extroversion, Conscientiousness, Emotional Stability,  Openness,  and Work  Drive.  Optimism was positively and significantly related to learner self-direction ( sr = .09, p &lt; .01), which supports Hypothesis 6. Table 3 shows  the  part  correlation  and  part  correlation  squared coefficients. An examination of the squared part correlations indicates  that  when  all  other  variables  were  controlled  for, Optimism accounts for approximately 1% of the variance in learner self-direction.

Hypothesis  5: Work  Drive  will  be  uniquely,  positively related  to  learner  self-direction  after  controlling  for  the other Big Five and narrow traits.

To estimate the unique relationship between  Work Drive  and  learner  self-direction,  a  part  correlation  was calculated, controlling for Agreeableness, Extroversion, Conscientiousness, Emotional Stability, Optimism, and Openness.  Work  Drive  was  positively  and  significantly related  to  learner  self-direction  ( sr =  .31, p &lt;  .01),  which supports Hypothesis 4. Table 3 shows the part correlation and part correlation squared coefficients. An examination of the  squared part correlations indicates that when all other variables were controlled for, Work Drive accounts for more approximately 10% of the variance in learner self-direction.

Hypothesis 5a: The part correlation for Work Drive and learner  self-direction  will  be  higher  than  all  the  corresponding part correlations for the other traits.

The part correlation for Work Drive ( sr = .31) was higher than all other corresponding part correlations.

Hypothesis  6: Optimism  will  be  uniquely,  positively related  to  learner  self-direction  after  controlling  for  the other Big Five and narrow traits.

## Overall Variance

All  variables  were  entered  simultaneously  into  a  multiple regression model to estimate the degree of learner self-direction prediction. The overall regression was significant, F (7, 2094) = 15.19, p &lt; .01, and these variables accounted for more than 52% of the variance in learner self-direction. As can be seen in Table 4, five of the variables explained significant variance  in  the model:  Work  Drive,  Openness,  Optimism, Emotional Stability, and Extroversion. The strongest correlate of learner self-direction was Work Drive (β = .37, p &lt; .01), followed by Openness (β = .23, p &lt; .01), Optimism (β = .12, p &lt;  .01),  Emotional  Stability  (β  =  .07, p &lt;  .01), Extroversion (β = -.05, p &lt; .05), Conscientiousness (β = .03, ns ), and Agreeableness (β = .02, ns ), which had the lowest magnitude correlation with learner self-direction in the study.

## Conclusion and Discussion

In determining the importance of personality in relation to learner self-direction for college age students, Big Five and narrow  personality  traits  and  learner  self-direction  were examined to determine the unique contribution of the relationships. To this end, it was hypothesized that both Big Five and narrow personality traits would be predictive of learner self-direction, and that there would be a positive part correlation for each of the six traits, except for Extroversion, which would  have  a  non-directional  relationship.  Specific  focus

was placed on Work Drive and Openness because those two personality traits have consistently been found to have a significant relationship with learner self-direction. A summary of the results from the present study is provided regarding the  relationship  between  individual  traits  and  learner  selfdirection. Also included is a discussion of the implications, some  limitations  of  the  study,  and  possible  directions  for future research.

## Discussion

The present study was generally successful in terms of providing validation of the main research propositions. Five of the seven hypotheses were supported, which is both consistent  with  and  extends  prior  studies  (Kirwan  et  al.,  2010; Lounsbury  et  al.,  2009)  in  that  learner  self-direction  was uniquely related to four of the Big Five traits studied as well as and both of the narrow traits examined here. The present findings  reinforce  and  support  Lounsbury  et  al.'s  (2009) study, which demonstrated ' . . . the importance and richness of the self-directed learning construct and . . . its role as a personality  trait'  (p.  417).  Considering  first  the  Big  Five traits,  the  significant,  positive  relationships  between  them and learner self-direction are consistent with Lounsbury et al.'s  (2009)  findings.  Regarding  the  narrow  traits,  significant,  positive  relationships  between  learner  self-direction and Work Drive as well as Optimism were also supported.

It is interesting to note that the present findings run contrary to what Lounsbury et al. (2009) suggested in that the unique  importance  of  Emotional  Stability,  Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, and Optimism in relation to learner selfdirection is insignificant and probably should not be included in future trait-based nomological networks for learner selfdirection. This means that the corresponding interpretation of  self-directed  learners  as  being  emotionally  resilient  and better able to deal with stress than their traditional learning counterparts (Lounsbury et al., 2009) is unwarranted. Similarly, based on these findings, Lounsbury et al.'s (2009) interpretation that self-directed learners are more conscientious and more agreeable than their traditional peers is not defensible and should not be included in a profile of key personality traits of self-directed learners as unique indicators. One possible reason for the discrepancy between the current findings and those of Lounsbury et al. (2009) is that they did not control for multicollinearity of the Big Five traits and did not analyze part correlations as was done here.

In the present study, Conscientiousness was not found to have  a  unique,  significant  relationship  with  learner  selfdirection when controlling for the other traits-which does not  support  the  second  hypothesis.  The  analysis  did  not indicate evidence of a unique relationship between Conscientiousness and learner self-direction as suggested by previous research (e.g., Lounsbury et al., 2009; Oliveira &amp; Simões, 2006). While there was a significant bivariate correlation between Conscientiousness and learner self-direction, the  part  correlation  was  small  and  not  significant.  From  a statistical standpoint, one possible explanation for this incongruity  is  that  Conscientiousness  is  multicollinear  with  the other traits and does not uniquely predict learner self-direction  alone.  However,  from  a  learning  perspective,  some aspects of the global traits likely contribute to the complexity of  the  learner  self-directed  learning  construct.  One  reason for  the  multicollinearity  is  the  complexity  of  learner  selfdirection.  For  example,  it  is  possible  that  some  facets  of Conscientiousness (such as competence, order, dutifulness, achievement striving, and self-discipline; Costa &amp; McCrae, 1992) are important to learner self-direction (e.g., Oliveira &amp; Simões,  2006)  and  could  possibly  be  used  to  enhance  the level  of  predictability  (Moon,  Hollenbeck,  Humphrey,  &amp; Maue, 2003) that broader traits cannot distinguish alone. It is possible that many of these facets are expressed in the narrow trait of Work Drive, which had the strongest correlation, and part correlation, with learner self-direction.

In the case of Optimism, it appears that the magnitude of the  optimism-learner  self-direction  relationship  is  lower than what was reported by Lounsbury et al. (2009). Students with higher levels of learner self-direction still appear to be more optimistic and upbeat than traditional learners, but the magnitude  of  this  relationship  is  relatively  minor,  representing less than 2% of the shared variance between these two variables. In the case of Optimism, in particular, further research is needed to determine causal directionality. For example, while it is likely that higher (or lower) levels of Optimism lead to higher (or lower) levels of learner selfdirection, it may also be that successful self-directed learning  leads  to  higher  grades  and  more  recognition  from teachers,  among  other  positive  outcomes,  which,  in  turn, leads  to  higher  levels  of  generalized  positive  expectancies-that  is,  optimism.  Several  lines  of  research  have shown that optimism can be learned (Seligman, 1991) and modified through interventions (Gillham, Reivich, &amp; Shatte, 2001).

On the contrary, some of the major conclusions about the importance  of  Work  Drive  and  Openness  in  relation  to learner  self-direction  hold  up  well  in  the  current  study, though the order of importance is reversed. Thus, Lounsbury et al.'s (2009) conclusion that, 'it appears that the personality trait most characteristic of self-directed learners is Openness' should be emended to the following: It appears in the current study  that  the  personality  trait  most  characteristic  of  selfdirected learners is Work Drive. Openness still demonstrates a significant, unique relationship with learner self-direction, and was the second highest part correlation in  the  present study,  which  is  consistent  with  findings  of  Kirwan  et  al. (2010), Lounsbury et al. (2009), and Oddi (1984). Thus, the results support Lounsbury et al.'s (2009) explanation that Self-Directed Learning is also fairly highly related to Work Drive . . . is understandable given that individuals with higher levels of Work Drive are prone to set more challenging goals for themselves  and  to  go  above  and  beyond  typical  performance expectations. (Lounsbury, Gibson, &amp; Hamrick, 2004, p. 416)

The present results affirm the strength of the construct of Work Drive as a trans-situational predictor of performance in many different domains-including work and academic settings-as  suggested  by  Lounsbury,  Gibson,  and  Hamrick (2004).  The  Work  Drive  construct  is  in  alignment  with Gladwell's (2008) claim that success requires a substantial amount of effort and time, what he calls the '10,000 hour rule,' which is achieved by the type of effort expended by individuals with a high Work Drive.

Brockett and Hiemstra (1991) emphasized the importance of self-directed learners being able to plan their own learning program and consistently evaluate progress. Hiemstra (1994) noted that self-directed learners should be prepared for the 'unexpected'  and  capable  of  dealing  with  challenges  in learning. Ponton and Carr (2000) stated that 'the concept of autonomy  (Knowles,  1980;  Merriam  &amp;  Caffarella,  1999) exists  under  the  personality  characteristic  rubric  of  selfdirected  learning'  (p.  273).  A  student  showing initiative, resourcefulness , and persistence is exhibiting manifestations related to personality characteristics as a learner. Ponton and Carr  noted  that  Confessore  (1991,  p.  129)  suggested  that individuals  who  exhibit  these  'conative'  factors  in  their learning activities 'possess traits which are essential to successful self-direction in learning' (p. 273). These factors are related to Ponton's (1999) discussion of autonomous learning consisting of five behaviors: goal-directedness, actionorientation, active-approach to problem solving, persistence in overcoming obstacles, and self-startedness , which is consistent with the aforementioned conceptualizations of Work Drive (Lounsbury &amp; Gibson, 2010). Again, this aligns with Lounsbury, Gibson, and Hamrick's (2004) Work Drive construct as a predictor of performance and Gladwell's (2008) emphasis on persistence leading to success.

The second important modification in Lounsbury et al.'s (2009)  conceptual  account  of  the  relationships  between learner self-direction and the personality traits studied here pertains to the relatively large amount of variance, which is shared among the personality traits in accounting for variation in learner self-direction. Only approximately 15% of the total of 24% of variance in learner self-direction accounted for by the personality traits can be assigned to individual personality traits, meaning that the other 9%, or more than one third, of the total variance in learner self-direction is shared among the traits and not attributable to any one trait. Traits may be actualized in combination or together when students engage in self-directed learning.

Grow (1991) described many different types of learners and teachers in his Staged Self-Directed Learning Model. He states  that  some  factors  of  self-directed  learning  can  be developed,  while  others  are  difficult  to  suppress.  Grow asserts that self-direction is both a function of personal attributes,  which  develop  in  stages,  and  situational  responses which  overlap  uniquely  in  each  individual.  Brockett  and Hiemstra  (1991)  agreed  that  self-direction  in  learning  is  a complex combination of person and environment, which is different for each learner.

The results of the present study are fully consistent with Lounsbury et al.'s (2009) observation that 'more generally, it is clear that self-directed learning does not occur in isolation from  other  personality  traits;  rather,  self-directed  learning appears to be connected to a wide range of different traits' (p. 416). Based on the complexity of self-directed learning, it makes  sense  that  self-directed  learning  cannot  be  readily assigned to the Big Five traits. It makes much more sense that aspects of each of the Big Five are used in combination to  achieve  learning  goals,  which  would  explain  the  large amount of shared variance between the traits.

The first research question was to determine the relationship between Extroversion and learner self-direction. While the results of the present investigation indicated a significant, positive relationship between Extroversion and learner selfdirection, the effect size was very small. This finding is consistent with Lounsbury et al. (2009), but contradicts Kirwan et al.'s (2010)  non-significant  finding.  Such  conflicting results can be seen as mirroring the lack of a clear connection in the larger literature between Extroversion and learner selfdirection.  One  potential  explanation  is  that  self-directed learners can function just as well alone or in group settings.

The generalizability of personality-learner self-direction relationships across different domains of demographic and social role characteristics augurs well for future self-direction learning theory development-which seeks to establish generalized construct relations involving personality traits-and it provides food for thought concerning a crucial unresolved issue  noted  by  Clancy  and  Dollinger  (1993):  What  is  the causal  direction  of  the  personality-learner  self-direction relationship? That is, do personality traits influence learner self-direction,  or  does  learner  self-direction  influence  personality traits, or is the relationship bi-directional? Attempts to  resolve  this  issue  should  involve  a  longitudinal  design, which  was  not  utilized  in  either  Lounsbury  et  al.  (2009), Kirwan et al. (2010), or the present investigation, and may involve  measurement  of  college  student  experiences  and activities  through  which  personality  is  manifested. As  but one example, it may be that higher levels of Openness and Work Drive lead to more successful study habits (Lounsbury, Gibson,  &amp;  Hamrick,  2004)  and  academic  performance (Ridgell  &amp;  Lounsbury,  2004),  which  may,  in  turn,  lead  to higher levels of learner self-direction.

Nevertheless, there are several considerations that point toward a conceptual model emphasizing the primacy of personality  traits  in  leading  to  and  influencing  learner  selfdirection. From a lifespan-developmental perspective (e.g., Berger, 2001; Erickson, 1980), identity issues emerge primarily in adolescence, whereas personality traits, including constructs corresponding to the Big Five, have been reliably studied  in  children  as  young  as  age  3  (van  Lieshout  &amp; Haselager,  1994);  thus,  it  is  not  unreasonable  to  consider personality traits as preceding learner self-direction. Moreover, personality traits are typically regarded as being relatively invariant or consistent over time and across situations and environmental or situational characteristics (e.g.,

Pervin &amp; John, 1997), whereas learner self-direction may be influenced by environmental factors such as student-teacher interactions, rewards for autonomous learning in school, the opportunity  for  more  choice  in  the  learning  environment, and parental encouragement for self-regulated learning by the child (Connell &amp; Wellborn, 1991; d'Ailly, 2004; Deci &amp; Ryan,  2002;  McCombs,  2006;  Zimmerman  &amp;  Schunk, 2001).

The present findings can also be interpreted in light of Chickering and Reisser's (1993) seven major developmental vectors or outcomes for college students. These developmental vectors can be seen, in part, as logical outcomes of personality traits (Chickering, 2004). If, as we contend, the significant personality traits in this study are important for  learner  adjustment  and  self-direction,  then  some  of these traits should correspond to Chickering and Reisser's major  dimensions.  Indeed,  this  is  the  case  for  the  vector they  term moving  through  autonomy  toward  interdependence ,  which  is  related  to  the  learner  self-direction  and Conscientiousness.

As  another  perspective  on  the  present  findings,  if  one assumes that personality  traits  are  relatively  consistent  for students across situations and over time, and if learner selfdirection changes more across situations and over time, the most  logical  interpretation  of  why  the  personality  traitlearner  self-direction  relationship  is  relatively  consistent within and across disparate factors such as age and returning to college after a long break is because the personality traits are driving the relationship, which implies that personality traits  are  affecting  learner  self-direction,  not  the  reversethat learner self-direction is primarily influencing personality  traits.  If  reciprocal  influence  was  found  for  personality traits and learner self-direction, it would lend support to the idea that learner self-direction is a complex construct that is not simply connected to any one trait. This is a theoretical scenario which should be more rigorously tested by future research,  but  should  it  prove  to  be  even  partially  true,  it would  have  major  implications  for  those  theories  of  selfdirection in learning which place primary emphasis on the role of personal experiences and environmental determinants of  college  student  learning  self-direction. As  Long  (1989) suggested, focusing on the psychological characteristics of the learner puts the emphasis on learning rather than pedagogical processes (Garrison, 1997). Understanding psychological aspects of students can help teachers identify individual needs, foster self-direction, and create a dynamic, learner-centered environment. Such a model would not rule out the role of experiential and environmental factors in selfdirected learning for learners; rather, it would mean that personality  traits,  even  traits  measured  in  high  school,  may subsequently influence collegiate activities and experiences, which may, in turn, affect the self-directed learning of college students. It may even be that personality traits, not academic and personal experiences, are the major determinants of college student self-directed learning.

## Limitations

While the present investigation has contributed significantly to  the  body  of  knowledge  regarding  personality  traits  and their relationships with learner self-direction, there are several limitations of the current study that should be acknowledged. First, this  study  was  limited  to  a  single  geographic area at a large, public university, leaving open the question of generalizability to other time periods, geographic areas, and types  of  universities.  Most  of  the  study  participants  were lower level students; thus, it is not possible to know if the results would generalize to samples of primarily upper level or  graduate  students. A  broader  sample  distribution  would give  a  more  complete  picture  of  the  relationship  between personality  traits  and  learner  self-direction.  For  example, how might  personality  trait-learner  self-direction  relationships  differ  in  students  in  smaller  colleges,  non-traditional students, or learners outside of formal learning environments?

Second,  the  current  study  looked  at  personality-learner self-direction relationships at a single point in time. A longitudinal  study  would  give  a  better  picture  of  the  stability of  the  relationship  between  personality  traits  and  learner self-direction over time. For example, to what extent is selfdirection  in  learning  affected  by  social  interactions  and specific learning environments?

Finally, the present study used an archival data set. While there are numerous advantages to the use of archival data, such as being more convenient and useful in exploring several associations of interest, there are drawbacks as well. For example, archival data sets may have missing data, validity issues such as lack of control over data collection, and issues of generalizability as the sample may not adequately represent the population under study.

## Recommendations for Future Research

There  are  a  number  of  other  interesting  areas  for  future research,  which  could  clarify  and  extend  the  present  findings. In addition to the need for replication on different samples, research could be conducted on how the Big Five and narrow  personality  traits  relate  to  sense  of  identity  and learner self-direction. Another topic for investigation is the relationship between age of students and learner self-directedness. As  mentioned  earlier,  perhaps  the  most  important need  for  future  research  is  to  utilize  longitudinal  research designs to help clarify the direction of causality for personality traits vis-à-vis self-directed learning and to try determine how these linkages are established. For example, do individuals who are more optimistic engage in new learning activities than more pessimistic individuals which helps facilitate self-direction for optimistic students? Hopefully, subsequent research  in  this  area  can  assess  the  linkages  among  selfdirected learning, Big Five and narrow traits, and a variety of important criteria in the college student domain, including

cumulative grades and performance in a single class (e.g., Furnham, Chamorro-Premuzic, &amp; McDougall, 2003; Lounsbury, Sundstrom, Gibson, &amp; Loveland, 2003), life satisfaction (Lounsbury, Saudargas, &amp; Gibson, 2004), dropout and retention (Heilbrun, 1962, 1965), and subjective wellbeing (DeNeve &amp; Cooper, 1998).

## Concluding Remarks

The results of the present study indicate that the Big Five traits as well as the two narrow traits measured in this study were each related to learner self-direction, with Work Drive and Openness accounting for most of the variance in learner self-direction  on  their  own.  Taken  as  a  whole,  the  present findings were interpreted as, in part, confirming and extending the results of Lounsbury et al. (2009) and Kirwan et al. (2010) regarding the Big Five, narrow traits, and learner selfdirection,  demonstrating  the  generalizability  of  personality trait-learner  self-direction  relationships  across  a  variety  of different demographic and personal subgroups of students, and  providing  some  clues  that  the  direction  of  the  causal arrow may be from personality traits to learner self-direction.

In  conclusion,  it  is  clear  that  learner  self-direction  has multiple connections to personality traits and is not clearly associated with just one of the Big Five traits. In a sense, this pattern of multiple connections to personality is consistent with the diverse factors learner self-direction has been linked to in the theoretical literature, as, for example, the six vectors of college student development that Chickering and Reisser (1993) posited as leading to identity establishment for college students. Hopefully, further research will extend and  clarify  the  nomological  network  of  personality  traits and  self-direction  in  learning  across  a  broad  range  of settings.
