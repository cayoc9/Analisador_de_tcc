Abstract -  SDL  is  a  fundamental  educational  goal.  However, higher  education  institutes  are  challenged  when  promoting SDL.  Therefore,  the  present  study  aims  to  explore  existing practices of self-direct learning implemented in the faculty and to identify problems of undergraduates when they are engaging with self-direct learning practices in the faculty.The study  reflects  that  most  of  the  students  are  familiar  with  the term  self-directed  learning.  They  had  experienced  with  selfdirect  learning  activities  of  assignments,  class  presentations conducted  by  students,  group  work  or  group  discussions, practical/laboratory  classes,  field  visits/field work,  quizzes, tutorial classes, independent research project, e-learning, independent learning, food processing plant, in-plant training/industrial training, viva, and farmer training program.Students express different learning preferences. However, students struggle with some issues when they engage with SDL. The issues are mainly related to course curriculum, teaching process, students' factors, and lecturers' issues.

## I. INTRODUCTION

SDL  provides opportunity for learners to formulate  eir h learning goals, identify relevant information resources, choose,  and  implement  appropriate  learning  strategies  and evaluate the learning outcomes (Sze-yeng  and  Hussain, 2010: 1914). Therefore, it is worthwhile to higher education institutes  to  incorporate s elf-direct learning  activities  with the teaching process. This could be achieved at curriculum  designing  level. Boud and Higgs (2004) : 2 describe that self-direct learning could be promoted through project work, laboratory activities, learning  ontracts c and other learning activities and open- nded e assignments. Du (2013: 3) mentions that  eflective r learning journals, portfolios and study plans are used for promoting SDL. Further,  the  online  selfdirected  learning  facilitates  learner -autonomy as e-learning (Yang, 2015: 3).

Students' restriction to tra learning to student-centered is a major challenge. Moreover, lectures-based  classes, interesting to test memorizations rather than understanding, old lecture notes, grading system; large class size and  lack  of proper  guidance  for  ting each methods  are  the challenges for enhancing  SDL  in  higher ( uglielmino, G 2013: 10).

As an innovative teaching learning practice,  -direct self learning (SDL) has  changed  the  higher  educational  reform. Therefore, several countries have included the selfect -dir learning as an educational goal or mission (Prabjandee  and  Inthachot,  2013:  2) Self-direct  learning  is . considered as a core concept in problemed -bas learning (PBL) and student-centred learning (Silen and Uhlin,  2008: 461). Students are responsible and independent in learning  process to  enhance  the  self -direct  learning  ability (Silen  and  Uhlin, 2008 :  461). Since learner initiates and takes the responsibility of their own learning activities, self direct learning is a more effective learning approach (Yang, 2015:  3).  Self-direct  learning is  defined  as ,  in  its  broadest meaning, 'self- directed learning' describes a process which  individuals take the initiative, with  s  without u the assistance of others, in diagnosing their learning formulating learning goals, identify human and resources for learning,  choosing  and  implement appropriate learning strategies, and evaluating learning (Knowles, 1975:18).

The self -directed learner is defined as, A highly -directed learner, based  on the survey results, is one  who  that exhibits initiative, independence, and persistence learning;  one  who  accepts  responsibility  for  his  or  her  own the

identify  three themes   of  facilitators and barriers for self -directed learning; student controlled, faculty-controlled, and administration-controlled facilitators and barriers.

However, in the changing environment, individual st mu diagnose learning needs, locate learning resources, carryout and  evaluate  the  leaning  approach.    Change  n information i technology made the learner characteristics and critically important. Students need to be highly self-directed since traditional teaching learning methods are not sufficient for the changing life,  hich w requires continual learning (Guglielmino, 2013: 13).  Developing skills and attitudes toward  self -directed  learning  is  not  a  linear  process  which requires a transformation, rom f following orders to self -directed  learning  activities,  from  memorizing  and  repeating to discovering, integrating, an d presenting, from  listening and reacting to communicating and taking responsibility, from knowledge of facts, terms, and understanding  [and  developing]  processes,  from  theory  to application of theory, from being teacher endent -dep to being [independent] (Guglielmino, 2013: 5).

However,  individuals  exhibit  different  levels  of  SDL  skills when engaging with SDL activities. (Kim et al., 2014: 152). Psychological variables also correlate with SDL  (Francis and  Flanigan, 2012 :  3). Thus ,  the educational institutions consider learners' individual differences to enhance the selfdirect  learning  approach  (rabjandee  and  Inthachot,  2013: P 1-2).  Boud and Higgs (2004:  2 argue ) that there is considerable gap between expectations and achievements.

## II. METHODOLOGY

the

Guidelines have been designed for integrating SDL into the curriculum  to  facilitate  SDL  ( uglielmino, 2013: 11).  PreG university study skills preparation and self -directed learning readiness  are  also  important (Warburton  and  Volet,  2012 : 10). Alternative course delivery formats such as online- using learning formats (Dynan et al., 2008:  100), e ducational blogs(Robertson, 2011 :  1628, 1631 ),  web 2.0 technology (Kim et  al., 2014:  150),  web-based  learning  environments (Senyuvaand Kaya, 2014 : 386, 39091)could -3 be incorporated to enhance SDL. owever,  enhanced H SDL provides  space  for  students  to  experience  SDL  activities.  It promotes collaboration of peers, shares owledge,  and kn creates learning communities, encourages better learning, increases  learning  interests,  better  performance,  motivation for educ tional a experience, lifelong learning skills,  expected cell counts less than five is greater than 20% in participate  beyond classroom hours,  cost  effective  learning tool  a nd  increases  access  to  course  (mandu A et  al., 2013: 681-682).  Furthermore, collaboration between  faculty  and librarians  is  important  to  enhance  the  information  literacy and self-direct learning (Silen and Uhlin, 2008: 473). Mixed methods approach with concurrent triangulation design was employed for the present study. The undergraduate students who  were immediately completed the degree programme in one of the faculties in the University was selected as the study group .  The samples  of 146 students wereselected  for the quantitative approach simple random sampling. The questionnaire with closed ended questions was administered among the sample. Ninety-eight completed questionnaires were returned within the  period  of  two  months.  Then  data  were  analyzed  using Statistical  Package  for  Social  Sciences(SPSS), version  23. Chi sq uare test of independence was adopted o t identify significant  relationships  with significance  level of 0.05.    If the p value is less than or equal 0.05 (α), it is considered as a  significant  relationship  whereas  if  p  value  is  greater  than 0.05, it is not considered as a significant relationship. When the the Chi square output, the likelihood ratio was considered as mentioned  by  McHugh  (2013 : 143-149).  Further  Cramer's value was calculated to determine the strength of relationship as the questionnaire employed nominal and ordinal data. The strength was determined sed ba on the scale mentioned  by  Kotrlik et al., (2011,  138).  If  Cramer's V,

Open ended  questions were  included in the me  questionnaire sa which  was  used for quantitative approach. Data were collected from 146 students as mentioned in the quantitative approach. Non-probability, convenience sampling technique was adopted for semi-structured interviews. Data was collected until reach  the saturation p oint as described by Kumar (2014). Sample size for the interview was then determined as 10 respondents when it achieved saturation point. Finally, data were analyzed using thematic analysis technique.

## Familiarity of the term 'self-direct learning'

The University Entrance in Sri Lanka is based on the results of the GCE A/L. he T highest percentage of respondents (93.9%) has done their GCE A/L   in Sinhalese medium while 06 respondents (6.1%) have done  n it i Tamil medium.However, none of the respondents (0%) have done their GCE A/L in English medium (figure 2).

The familiarity of the term 'selfct -dire learning' was assessed.  The  highest  percentage,  77.6%  was  familiar  with the term 'self-direct learning' whereas 9.2% do not familiar with  the  term  'self -direct  learning'.  However, 13.3% of  the students do  not have an idea of the term  -direct 'self learning' (figure 3).

discussions,  learning approach. Moreover, students mentioned that it was tutorial  easy  to  understand  unclear  subject  matters  through  group that  work and avoid misconceptions of subject matters. Students One  student  sta ted that thatgroup  work  wa s  an  effective a also  understood  the  importance  of  ge ing  peers  feedback, tt improvement  of  communication  skills  through  group  work and getting different perspectives from peers.

It is obvious that, the highest percentage of respondents, 100% ha ve engaged with independent research project while the least percentage of respondents, hasengaged  with  tutorial  classes.  Other  than  that,  it  seems that  most  of the students have engaged  in different selfdirected learning activities; assignments, class presentations conducted by themselves, group work/group practical/laboratory classes, field visits, quizzes, classes.  But four (4) respondents (4.1%) mentioned they have engaged with other activities  e-learning, of independent learning, food processing plant,  plant in -training, viva and farmer training program (figure 4).

The  semi-structured  interviews  were  focused  on  one  of  the SDL activities; e-learning to get the in-depth information on the  use and preference for learning eof undergraduate students. All the respondents who participated for the semi structured interview used the rning e -lea platform implemented by the faculty.

- 'I  like  to  work  as  a  group  because  it  will  help  me  to understand  difficulties arising when  I am  studying. It enhances our learning. If I missed some important points, I could catch them while discussing and if I captured something  wrong,  I  could  correct  it  if  I  discuss  with  my friends' (Student D).

student  red to study individually as one student stated that, Usually, individual learning behavior may be different from one person to another. erefore, Th some respondents prefer the 'I like to study individually because the way of studying is unique  to  an  individual;  it  varies  from  one  person  to another. My way of studying may not match with my friends, so  I  like  to  study  by  myself.  But  I  prefer  to  teach  my colleagues then I can easily remember it' (Student G).

Usually e-learning platform provides the opportunity for an expanded  learning  environment.  All  the articipants  stated p that e earning -l platform was useful. One emphasized the usefulness of videos uploaded as a learning resource. However,  the  undergraduate  students  mentioned that e -learning platform  was  helpful  them  to get learning resources uploaded by respective lecturers and to submit their assignments. As one student commented that submission  of  assignments  through  e learning  system was -easier than the submission of hard copy,

- '…When submitting assignment, that was useful because it was  easy  to  submit  a  soft  copy  via  e-learning  platform rather than written or as a hard copy' (Student J).

Although some students prefer d  to re study individually, they had experienced the advantage of group study to clarify subject matters as,

- 'I prefer to study alone and want to understand by myself. But for the confirmation of the things, I studied and if I need any clarifications, I prefer to do group studies. But when I need to study in a rush I used to study as a group' (Student

## F. Preferred Method of Study

Meanwhile, semi -structured interview focused one of the other SDL activities, group work. Eight students (80% ) had preferred group study while two students (20%) had preferred  to study individually. Since group work  allows  J). collaborative learning, students are benefitted by group work. Students mentioned that group work allow ed them to discuss subject matters and hared  the s knowledge  among group members. As one student stated,

'I like to work as a group. I can discuss with my friends and share our knowledge with each other. If we have any doubts related  to  subject,  I  discuss  with  my  friends  and  then  it  is easy  to  understand  unclear  subject  matters.  Usually  we discussed past papers, questions etc. My friends may have another perspective than me and then we can share idea' (Student A)

Four methods were given in the questionnaire as 'I prefer to listen lectures only,  I prefer if the lecture is incorporated with  above  activities,  I  prefer  to  study  their  own  way  with the  guidance  of  the  lecturer  and  any  other  to lect  one  of se most the preferred methods of learning.

on the they  none  of The results revealed that 61.2% of the respondents preferred if the lecture was incorporated with  -direct self learning activities  mentioned  in  figure  4,  36.7%  preferred   to  study their own way with the dance gui of the lecturer, 2.0%mentioned that they preferd  other re methods which include  'through internet' and 'e earning'.  Nevertheless, -l the students  (0.0%)  prefer  to  listen lectures only (Figure 5).

Usually, students practicedhaving group discussions subject matter and past exaation min papers before examinations. Most  of the students emphasized that had discussions based on past examination papers and group discussions on subject matter helped them to answer examination well. For an example,

Based on the thematic analysis  f o the study, mainly the students were  challenged by  ssues i in course curriculum, teaching process, students' factors and lecturers' issues.

## 1. Course Unit System/Curriculum Issues

Students  identified  that  the  workloadwas  heavy  so  as  they did not  have  time  to  refer  extra  learning  resources  such  as library resources.

- 'Library resources are useful, but with academic work load it is difficult to freely associate with books' (Student 28).

## 2. Issues of Teaching Process

It is observed that students preferred  -direct self learning activities and they had stated the  dequate  self-direct ina learning activities adopted by lecturers and combination self -direct leaning activities. As one student commented,

'After lecture, 10 minutes have to use for explaining lecture in Sinhalese. It will help to improve in lives and prevent out of fail exam' (Student 39).

There  were discussions existing in literature related restrict  for  adapting  or  transforming  to  innovative  modern learning environments. It was noted that some the f respondents participated for semitructured -s interview do not  prefer  e -learning  or  less  preference  of  e-arning.  One le student commented that,

'I used the e-learning system but not much. I used it if the lecturer made if compulsory but uploaded materials such as videos were highly useful…' (Student C).

## 4. Lecturer Issues

inappropriate Lecturers also restrict transforming to modern learning environments.  Most  of  the  respondents  stated  that all the lecturers  did  not  use  the  elearning  as  a  teaching  tool.  For -example,

'All these were  practiced (refer the list of activities mentioned) but not correctly  combined.  Each  lecturer  had one  or  two  above  methods  familiar  with  and  did  not  go beyond that. One subject did not combine all these methods' (Student 28).

- '…only some lecture notes were uploaded while some were not  uploaded. It  will  be  very  helpful  if  they  upload  all  the related learning resources' (Student C).

## H. Correlations

He had also identified that tight work schedule affects their learning approach and commented that students were unable to stu dy their own way due to tight work schedule lecturers. Students expectd  new e up to date concepts subject matters from the teaching process.

## 3. Student Issues

Language problem was one of the most affecting challenges for  self -direct  learning.  One  student  stated  the  necessity  of explaining lecture in mother language, whichwas an indirect expression of language problems.

IV. DISCUSSION Self-direct learning is the key for lifelong learning.  eases  learning  interests,  better  performance,  motivation Individuals must be motivated with self -directional skills to be lifelong learners (Szeyeng et al., 2010: 1913). Therefore, higher  educational  institutions  incorporated  self direct learning with the teaching process. A. Familiarity of Self-Direct Learning According  to  the  study,  most  of  the  students  are  familiar submitting assignments. But it could be used for expanding lifelong  oup the online term  assistance  when needed, seeking resources and improve the previous  earning process. It  promotes  collaboration  of  peers,  sharing  knowledge  and creates learning communities, encourages better learning, incr for educatnal io experience, lifelong learning participate  beyond classroom hours,  cost  effective  learning tool  and  increased  access  to  course.  MOODLE  e arning -le platform is fostering pre ss -cla preparation, post lass -c participation,  active learning, and  motivation  of  students.  It was  observed  that  students  in  the  present  study  used  the  e -learning platform for getting learning resources learning environment of undergraduate students such gr di scussions/forums, quizzes, collaborative learning. Furthermore, Song and Hill (2007:  5) 3 describe that learning allows more freedom, learners need monitor their learning activities by themselves, seeking l

with  the  term  self directed  learning  (77.6%).  Since  higher -education institutes are challenged to produce learners, self-direct learning skills are promoted among their students to be lifelg on learners. Therefore, most of students are familiar with the term -direct self learning. Nevertheless, few students do not familiar with the 'self-direct learning'. This may be due to their learning  experiences  of  teacher  centred  learnig,  restrict  to n adapting self-irect d learning exposure and the learning habit.

## B. Self-Direct Learning Practices Implemented in Faculty

The undergraduate students had experienced with self-direct learning activities of assignments, class conducted  by  students, practical/laboratory  classes,  field  visits/field  work,  quizzes, tutorial classes, inependent d research project, e- arning, le independent learning, food processing plant,  lant  in -p training/industrial training, viva, and farmer program.  Not all the students experienced all the activities (except  independent  research  project).  owever, H all  the students  had  experienced  the  independent  research project  since  it  is  being  a  compulsory  requirement  for  the  associated with the technological development. completion of their undergraduate degree programme. Thus, it implies that  he t faculty has incorporated selfirect -d learning activities with the teaching process. learning activities to improve self-direct learning skills have been identified by Boud and Higgs (2004: 2) and Warburton and  Volet  (2012: 9- 20).  Boud  and  Higgs  (2004  2)  discuss : that self -direct learning may  be  achied  through ev project work, laboratory activities, learning contracts and presentations  dergraduates group  work  or  group  discussions,  transform  beyond  their  traditional  learning  approach  which training  be  highly  self -motivated  and  self -directed  in  their  learning above  approach. So, as  they  prefer  to  study  their  own  way.  Some According  to  the  present  study,  the  highest  percentage  of students prefers to engage with the -direct self learning activities blended with the lecture. None of the students prefer to listen lectures only. This implies the motivation of un towards self rect -di learning. Students could  be  due  to  demand  of  self direct  learning  practices  in -higher education system. Moreover, some students prefer to study  their  own  way  with  guidance  of  lecturers.  They  may students also prefer other methods such as 'through internet' and 'e -learning' due to innovative learning environments

Due  urther, to learning  ademics  who  are  accepting  this  do  not  know  how  to when  adapt it. F all the lecturers do not use the  arning ele as a teaching tool. This may be due to restrict for changing from traditional teaching practices. tewart S (2007 : 62) also identified the similar internal barriers of restrict of ion academic  staff  for  adapting  new  learning  environments  and the  ac

Meanwhile, moderately strong significant relationships exist between preferred way  of learning and communication problems (p= 0.015, Cramer's v= 0.347). communication problems students may be challenged when they  are  seeking  assistance,  finding  learning  resources  and interacting with peers or teachers.  e, Therefor communication ski lls play a vital role for students'  -self directness. So as undergraduate students' preference is affected by communication problems they practice self-direct learning.

However, the relationship between preferred way of  lems  and  communication  problems.  Since  most  of  the learning and guidancegiven by lecturers when students needed  to  clarify  any  doubts  related  to  their  studies  is  not  medium or Tamil medium, they may struggle with language statically  significant  (p=  0.163).  Contrasting  to  the  present study, Francis and Flanigan (2012: 3) 71 identify the relationship between levels of SDL and learning preferences associated with high levels of instructor control and it is  not a direct relationship. D.  Problems  of  Undergraduates  when  they  are  Engaging with Self-Direct Learning Practices It  was noted that few students were challenged by language prob students have done their GCE A/L examination in Sinhalese problems as the degree programme offered by the  faculty is instructed in English medium. Nevertheless, the present study  identifies that the language  problem  is  independent from medium of GCE A/L. Bandara (2015 : 16) also discusses the similar issues of language difficulties as a major barrier for SDL. The language problem strongly correlates with communication problems (written/verbal). Therefore,  the  com munication  problems  may  be  due  to  the language problems of students. As discussed communication problems have an impact on students' preferred way of learning.

above,

Some  students  mentioned  the  inability  to  plan  their  work effectively. This may  be  due  tlack  of  proper  guidance, o lack  of  self- management  skills  and  lack  of  selfconfidence. -Similarly,  Kusumsiri  (2010 :  4)  identifies  problems  of  lack of knowledge to prioritize their work, difficulties identifying learning goals.

Undergraduate  students  are  challenged  by  different  factors when  they  engage  with  self direct  learning  activities.  The -problems  of  undergraduates  when  they  are  engaging  with self-directed learning practices in Faculty are mainly related to  course curriculum , teaching process, students'  actors, f and  lecturers'  issues .  Douglass  and  Morris  (2014:  13)  also identify similar issues under three themes of facilitators and barriers for self- irected d learning as student controlled, faculty-controlled  and  administration -controlled  facilitators and barriers.

Curriculum issues include tight work schedule/he avy workload, lack of time for  lf-study, se lack of time for library  use. Similarly,  Boud  and  Higgs  (2004:  10-17)  also identify issues related to curriculum, teaching and  g  platform  is limited.  This  is  due  to  restrict  to  move assessments.  Five  issues  related  to  implementation  of  SDL were mentioned as authority of SDL, finding an appropriate curriculum  framework,  establishing  a  suitable  institutional context, ensuring effective content oals,  and g developing appropriate student assessment. Douglass and Morris (20148-19) : 1 identify faculty -controlled facilitator s and barriers as class structure, curriculum design (job shadowing opportunities,  ent study has discussed by Song and Hill (2007:  32, independent  projects,  internship  and  clinical  opportunities) and professorial attitudes and traits (faculty advising and  not be able to respond each question due to heavy workload support,  faculty  use  of  real  world  experiences,  professorial enthusiasm) and administration controlled -facilitators and barriers as infrastructures and resources (scheduling of courses, class size, faculty workload, technology access), and incentives for students (rewards, recognition). Further, the present study identified less preference towards innovative learning environments such as  arning. e -le Although students  had  identified  e -learning  as  a  useful  tool for  teaching  and  learning,  their  preference  and  usage  of  e -learnin beyond  the traditional  classroom  setting. It is one of the most common issues. Similarly, Guglielmino (20130) : 1 discusses that one of the problems to develop -direct self learners is restrict  adaptation of students  since they have been  prepared  as  dependent  learners.  This  may  be  due  to external barriers such as teacher centered learning secondary schools and heavy orkload  for w students as discussed  by  Stewart  (2007:  62).

Contrasting to the present study,  ouglass,  and D Morris (2014: 16-18) discuss that student-controlled facilitators and barriers for self directed -learning are being proactive class,  being  proactive  with  other  students,  being  proactive outside of class, having good study metacognitive factors. Bandara (2015) further some contrasting issues to present study, pressure  and  insufficient  time  allocation  for  the  subject  as major barriers for SDL.

Most  of  the  students  agreed  that  lecturers  interested  to  test what they have memorized than what they have understood. Similar  issue   is  discussed  by  Guglielmino  (2013: 0)  that 1 most of the classes are based on lectures, exams, demand  for  testing  coverage  and  memorization  rather  than the understanding.

Very few students were challenged by lack of a clear idea of the  work  expected from  them  when  they  engage  with  self -direct learning activities. This may  be due to lack of insufficient  feedback/comments  from  lecturers.

Further, students were challenged by lack of guidance from staff when they needed to clarify any doubts on studies. This may be due to busy work schedule of lecturers and  large  number  of  students  in  a  lass.
