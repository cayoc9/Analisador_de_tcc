## Development of a self-rating scale of self-directed  learning

In  order  to  realise their  full  potential  as  learners, it  is essential that  students have good  self-directed learning skills. It is also important  that students develop their own roles in  learning  by  continuously  monitoring  their oi/vn learning progress,  identifying areas of deficit and making a conscious effort  towards self-improvement. In this paper, Swapna Naskar Williamson reports on  the development and testing of  a self-rating scale  of  self-directed learning in higher education, and considers how it  might be used in  practice  in  order  to  enhance  the  requisite skills  for becoming independent and lifelong learners.

## Background

The development  of self-directed  learning skills  has become one of the primary aims of adult education in the last few decades. Research and scholarship  in  self-directed  learning  have  increased  internationally,  and  new  programmes,  practices and  resources  for  facilitating self-directed  learning  have been introduced to help educators as well as learners.

Knowles  (1975)  explained  that  self-directed  learners  are  proactive  and take the  initiative  in  learning  rather than  passively waiting to  be taught as reactive  learners. Their  learning  is more  meaningful  and  purposeful,  with greater  motivation  resulting in  longer  retention. They are more  responsible

in  their  own  lives,  having  benefited  from  the  self-disciplining  process  of their  learning.  According to  Hiemstra  (1994)  and  Brookfield  (1986),  selfdirected learning is a process in which learners are responsible for planning, implementing, and evaluating their own learning and are expected to work independently  or  with  others,  in  order  to  achieve  pre-set  learning  goals. Knowles  (1980)  observed  that  students  entering  educational  programmes without  having  learned  skills  of  self-directed  inquiry  experienced  anxiety, frustration  and often  failure.

Various studies have reported that students initially experience anxiety and fear  about  self-directed  learning  and  express their  need  for  formal  instruction  in the concept of the self-directed-learning  process at the  beginning of their courses (Hewitt-Taylor  2001,  Lunyk-Child  et al 2001,  Miflin  et al 2000, Nolan  and  Nolan  1997,  Prociuk  1990). According to  Knowles  (1983),  this desire for instruction reflects the fact that adults may be unfamiliar with selfdirected  learning  and  may  find  it  problematic.  Williams  (2004)  states  that students  should  enter  their  professional  courses  with  the  understanding  of and ability to engage in continuous learning in order to ensure competence in professional practice. In their study of teachers' and students' perceptions of self-directed  learning,  Lunyk-Child et al (2001)  found that students undergo a transformation that begins with negative feelings but ends with confidence and skills  In self-direction  and  during this  transformation  it  is the  responsibility  of  teachers to  provide  student  support.  Kell  and Van  Deursen  (2002) expressed their  view that  it  is the  responsibility  of  educators  to  ensure  that students  acquire  self-directed  learning skills,  which  can  be transferred  from education to their place of work.

Universities  have  a vital  role  in  responding  to  the  challenges  of  society, especially when there is ample evidence of resistance to self-direction in adult learning  (Hiemstra  1991, Hiemstra  and  Brockett  1994).  Both  learners  and educators must possess a clear concept of self-directed learning and select the appropriate  teaching-learning  strategies  to  facilitate  and  enhance  learners' abilities  in becoming self-directed  in their  learning process, including in their self-assessment (Norman  1999).

The literature review revealed that Guglielmino's  (1977) SDLRS was used as a practical instrument for measuring self-directed learning readiness. However,

## issues in  research

there  is still  a need  for  instruments to  assess self-directed  learning  behaviour that are different  from the simple measuring of perceptions and readiness for self-directed learning (Brockett and Hiemstra 1991). Having considered demographic changes in the universities' student population, the dearth of suitable instruments for  assessing learners'  levels of  self-directedness  in  learning, and, more importantly, students' need for guidance in becoming self-directed learners as evidenced from the above review, the author attempted to develop an instrument to measure learners' levels of self-directedness in learning.

## The self-rating scale of self-directed learning (SRSSDL)

Self-direction  is the  basis of  all  learning;  be it formal  or  informal, the  effectiveness of learning is relative to an individual's motivation. All individuals are capable of self-directed learning but the degree of development varies due to their  individual  differences.  It  is important  that  both  educators and  learners have a clear understanding ofthe concept and nature of self-directed learning skills for  its further  development.  Educators, in this context, have the added responsibility  of  developing  learners'  full  potential  in  effective  self-directed learning through building and maintaining a harmonious team relationship. The 60-item  SRSSDL is an instrument  developed  for  measuring the  level  of self-directedness  in  one's  learning  process.  Knowledge  of  learners'  levels  of self-directedness  will  benefit  both  learners  and  educators.  Firstly,  students responding to the SRSSDL items will  not only  reveal their own levels of selfdirectedness  in  learning,  but  will  also  have  the  opportunity  to  develop  an insight into self-directed  learning and a better understanding ofthe  concept, which  is  crucial  for  developing  of  self-directed,  independent  and  lifelong learning.  Secondly, teachers,  having  identified  learners'  levels of  self-directedness and  deficits  in  learning, will  be  better  able  to  guide  students  from their  positions  of  learning  dependence  to  independence,  considering  each student's individual  learning needs.

## Methodology

A developmental  and descriptive qualitative  research approach was used to achieve the following study objectives:

- · To develop a self-rating scale of self-directed  learning (SRSSDL)

C To test the scale, and establish its reliability  and construct validity The study comprised two  parts. Part  1 included use ofthe  Delphi technique to develop and to determine content validity  ofthe  SRSSDL. Part 2 involved testing and establishing reliability  and construct validity  ofthe SRSSDL.

## Part  1: The development of the SRSSDL

Extensive literature was reviewed, and in particular the works of Guglielmino (1977),  Knowles  (1975),  Candy  (1991),  Hiemstra  (1994)  and  Brookfield (1986), to prepare a list of attributes, skills and competences of self-directed learners.  A  list  of  75  items,  each  reflecting the  requisite  behaviour  of  selfdirected  learners  was  developed.  Consultation  with  professional  colleagues also helped in the development of these items for the SRSSDL. Special attention was paid to  using only short and simple sentences in order to  keep the meaning clear and unambiguous.

## Delphi Technique

The Delphi technique was used to develop the SRSSDL: this technique aims to obtain judgements from a 'blind' panel of experts giving individual feedback on a specific  subject that  is then judged  by the  entire  panel. The  process is repeated, building on information obtained in each round, until there is some consensus (Polit and Hungler  1999, Sharkey and Sharpies 2001).

A panel of 15 experts, comprising six nurse educators, six doctors and three practice  educationalists,  was  purposively  sampled  from  higher  education institutions and teaching hospitals. Inclusion criteria included the requirement that each member had a postgraduate qualification with a minimum of three years' teaching experience. Each member was informed ofthe purpose ofthe study and consented to participate  in it.

The  SRSSDL  was  sent  electronically  to  panel  members.  Each  member responded to the items  individually  and  independently,  and returned  his or her  response  electronically  to  the  researcher.  Responses  were  obtained  for each  item  using a five-point  Likert  scale, with  a score  of  one  for  'strongly disagree' and a score of five for 'strongly agree'. The scale included a 'remark' column for  panel members to comment on or modify  any item. For an item to  be retained in the scale, at least 75  per cent agreement was needed from

## issues in  researcii

the  panel  of  experts.  Items  for  which  agreement  was  less than  75  per  cent were retained for modification and placement in the subsequent round. Items with  less than  25  per cent agreement were deleted.

## Results of the  Delphi technique

In  the  first  Delphi  round,  the  SRSSDL  contained  75  items:  10  items  were deleted as they  were disapproved  of  by 20-25  per cent of experts:  15  items were suggested for  modification.  In the first  round, 50  items were  approved by  80-90  per  cent  of  the  experts  and  were  retained.  In  the  second  round, 65  items  inclusive  of  15  modified  items were  re-submitted to the experts. 5 items were deleted  and 60  items  retained  having 80-85  per cent agreement of the experts.  Results of the  Delphi rounds are presented  in Table 1.

## Table 1. Delphi rounds consensus to select items for the SRSSDL

|   und |   Total number of items |   Number of items deleted |   Number of  items retained |   Number of items for modification |
|-------|-------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------------|
|     1 |                      75 |                        10 |                          50 |                                 15 |
|     2 |                      65 |                         5 |                          60 |                                  0 |

Two or three  rounds are deemed adequate when a Delphi technique  is used to  explore  a complex  issue and  for  obtaining consensus  (Jenkins  and  Smith 1994). There was no need for a third round because all 60 items received 80 -85  per  cent  agreement  by  the  panel  of  experts. Thus, content  validity  was established through the  Delphi technique experts' judgement.  Subsequently, the 60-item  SRSSDL was finalised.

## The  SRSSDL

The structure ofthe  SRSSDL (Appendix  1) included a brief profile of respondents and general instructions on how to use the scale. The SRSSDL comprised of  60  items categorised  under  five  broad areas of self-directed learning:

- · Awareness: Twelve items relating to learners' understanding ofthe  factors contributing to  becoming self-directed  learners.
- · Learning strategies: Twelve items explaining the various strategies

self-directed learners should adopt in order to become self-directed in their learning processes.

- n Learning activities: Twelve  items specifying the  requisite  learning activities  learners  should  actively  engage  in  order  to  become  self-directed  in their  learning processes.
- ;  : Evaluation: Twelve items revealing learners' specific attributes in order to help monitor their  learning activities.
- ; Interpersonal  skills: Twelve  Items  relating to  learners'  skills  in  inter-personal relationships, which are pre-requisite to their becoming self-directed learners.

Responses for each item are be rated by using a five-point scale: 5 =  always: 4  =  often:  3  =  sometimes:  2  =  seldom:  1  = never  An  'any  other'  space was also included for each broad area of the SRSSDL. This was to provide an opportunity  to  the  users of  the  S R S S D L to  include  any  other  relevant  items they  deemed  fit. Thus, the  S R S S D L became an open-ended  instrument. The categorisation  of S R S S D L Items into  five  broad areas allows for  specific areas where students lack abilities in their self-directedness to be identified and support offered. Students with high scores, indicating a high level of self-directedness in their  learning, should also be supported in order to help maintain and further develop their abilities in becoming independent  life-long learners.

## Scoring the  SRSSDL

All  the  items  of  the  SRSSDL  were  positively  stated.  For  each  item  the 'always'  response  was  rated  as  5  and  the  'never'  response  was  rated  as 1.  Thus,  the  maximum  and  the  minimum  possible  scores  of  the  SRSSDL were  300  and  60  respectively.  A  score  sheet  was  developed  to  interpret responses.  The  scoring  range  in  Table  2  indicates  the  respondents'  level of  self-direction  in  learning  based, on  their  individual  scores  and  the  corresponding interpretation.

## Part 2: Testing and establishing the construct validity and reliability of the SRSSDL

A purposive  convenience sampling technique  was used to  select the  study subjects  comprising  15 first-  and  1 5 final-year  undergraduate  nursing stu-

dents aged from 20 to 25 years who were willing to participate. The SRSSDL was given to  the  students  and the  purpose  of  the  study  was explained  to them.  The  instructions  for  the  use  of  the  SRSSDL were  read  out  and students' queries were clarified.

## Data analysis

The data collected were arranged  in a Microsoft  Excel spreadsheet. The students' responses to the SRSSDL were summarised in frequencies and percentages. The responses of both the first and final year students were summed up in order to obtain the average scores to establish the construct validity.

## Results

Figure  1 shows  first  year  undergraduate  nursing  students'  responses  in  the five  broad  areas  of  the  SRSSDL.  Most  students  responded  with  'seldom' and  'sometimes'  to  all  the  broad  areas,  whereas  only  a  small  percentage responded to the options 'often' and 'always'. Data also showed 3-8 per cent of  'never'  responses to  the  broad  areas of  the  SRSSDL. Thus, the  first  year students'  overall  responses  indicated  a low  level of self-direction  in  learning and  established  their  need  for  support  in  developing  self-directed  learning

skills. The  responses of the  final  year  undergraduate  nursing students to  all the broad areas of the SRSSDL are presented in Figure 2.

Most students  responded  with  'always'  and  'often'  in  all the  broad areas of  the  SRSSDL. The  responses  'sometimes'  in  the  areas  of  Learning strategies. Learning activities.  Evaluation and Interpersonal skills showed students' further  need  for  development  of  self-directed  learning  skills.  Furthermore, students'  responses  with  'seldom'  in  the  areas  of  Learning  activities  and Evaluation indicated the need for student support in order to develop requisite skills in becoming self-directed learners. The final year students expressed interest in all the items of the S R S S D L and all reported that while  responding to the SRSSDL items they  developed a better  understanding of  self-directed learning skills. They also expressed their  desire for  further  opportunities  for self-directed learning.

## Internal consistency and construct validity

To determine the internal consistency Cronbach's coefficient  alpha was computed.  In the  alpha  coefficient  reliability  test  a result  of  more  than  0.70  is

generally  considered to  have an acceptable and satisfactory  internal consistency (Nolan and Nolan 1997. Nunnally  1978. de Vaus 1991). Table 2 shows the obtained coefficient alpha of each broad area of the SRSSDL.

The computed coefficient alpha in all five areas indicates sufficient correlation.  Consequently, all the items of self-directed  learning were retained.

For establishing the construct validity a known-groups technique was used; it was observed that the first and final year students' average scores were 160 and 214  respectively.  It is apparent that the final year students' scores were higher than the first year students. Although both the groups' average scores differed, they possessed the same characteristics specified in the SRSSDL.

## Discussion

This study aimed to develop a valid and reliable scale to assess learners' selfdirected learning skills. The content validity of the SRSSDL items were established  following  the  review  of  related  literature  and  through  the  appraisal

| Broad area of the SRSSDL   |   Cronbach's alpha  coefficient |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Awareness                  |                            0.79 |
| Learning strategies        |                            0.73 |
| Learning activities        |                            0.71 |
| Evaluation                 |                            0.71 |
| Inter-personal Skills      |                            0.71 |

of the  panel  of  experts  participating  in the  Delphi technique. The responses of  the  first  and  final  year  students  reveal  that  the  final  year  students  are more self-directed  in  learning than  the  first-year  students,  who  have  more limited  skills  in self-directed  learning. This  indicates that  adult  learners  with more experience appear to be more self-directed  in their  learning processes. According  to  Sabbaghian  (1980),  individuals  who  have  completed  more years  of  formal  education  tended  to  demonstrate  a  higher  self-directed learning  preparedness.  All  the  students  participating  in  the  study  showed specific  interest  in the  items of S R S S D L and found  responding to the S R S S D L was useful in developing a clearer concept and better  understanding of selfdirected learning skills. Students require a formal  introduction to the concept of  self-directed  learning and  also  need to  be supported  in  its  development (Hewitt-Taylor2001, Iwasiw 1987, Lunyk-Child eta/2001, Miflin  eta/2000, Nolan  and  Nolan  1997b,  Prociuk  1990),  Self-directed  learning  skills  could be developed  through  careful  planning and  integration  into the  curriculum (Grow 1991). According to Candy (1991), self-directed learning, especially of discipline-based  knowledge, calls on attitudes, skills and knowledge that can be intentionally  developed through planned educational  interventions.

The present study was limited to obtaining data only from the undergraduate  nursing  student  population.  The  individual  students'  responses  to  the SRSSDL could  be tested to  find  out  the  level  of  self-directed  learning skills of the  students  who  participated  in the  study  for  a better  comparison. The

## issues in  research

SRSSDL  items  were  positively  stated  and  no  problems  were  identified  in obtaining responses from the students. But in order to reduce responder bias and to  prevent them from just scanning the  items and giving a similar score to each item, some statements could be negatively worded. An item analysis of the scale could be conducted on a larger sample.

The  SRSSDL was  found  to  be  a valid  and  reliable  instrument  in assessing learners'  levels of  self-direction  in  learning and can be used to  facilitate teaching-learning processes in furtherance of their self-directed learning skills. However,  further  research  is required  on  a larger  sample  for  generalisation and also for its wider application on student populations of other disciplines. Research  is needed that  entails  exploration  of  the  predictive  validity  of  the SRSSDL. Cross-sectional  and  longitudinal  studies  are  necessary  to  find  out the relationship between students' SRSSDL scores and academic  performance scores. Research is also recommended to study the relationship  between the SRSSDL scores,  age  and  gender  of  students.  Research  on  teachers'  preferences/attitudes regarding the SRSSDL as an instrument for assessing students' self-directed  learning  skills  is essential  so as to  discover  how  well  the  selfdirected  learning process is working for the students.

## Conclusion

The  SRSSDL developed  in  this  study  using the  modified  Delphi  technique was found to be a valid and reliable instrument in identifying learners' levels of self-direction  in  learning. The accurate assessment of one's own strengths and deficiencies  is the first step towards  self-directed  learning (Regehr  et al. 1996). Students, while responding to the items of the SRSSDL. will develop a clearer  concept and understanding of self-directed  learning behaviour  identify  the  areas  of  their  own  strength  and  weaknesses  and  select  appropriate strategies  for  furtherance  of  their  self-directed  learning  skills.  The  teachers will  also  be  able  to  carefully  and  sensitively  develop  'smart'  instructional materials  and  support  students  in  making  a conscious  effort  towards  their self-improvement.

Check the grand total score with the following scoring range in order to identify your level of self-directedness in learning.

| Scoring range   | Level of self-directedness in learning   | Interpretation                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 60-140          | Low                                      | Guidance is definitely needed from the teacher. Any specific changes necessary for improvement must be identified and a possible complete re-structuring of the methods of learning            |
| 141-220         | Moderate                                 | This is half way to becoming a self- directed learner. Areas for improvement must be identified, evaluated and a strategy adopted with teacher guidance when necessary                         |
| 221-300         | High                                     | This indicates effective self-directed learning. The goal now is to maintain progress by identifying strengths and methods for consolidation of the students' effective self-directed learning |

No matter what your total score, it is essential that you pay particular attention to any individual items of the S R S S D L in which you have scored below 3, as these are the areas in which you definitely need to improve.
