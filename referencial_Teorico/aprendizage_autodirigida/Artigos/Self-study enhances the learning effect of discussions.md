## ABSTRACT

## ARTICLE HISTORY

Background: Academic learning in higher education requires diverse activities such as reading, reviewing, and discussion. However, there are relatively few studies on the effect of the combination of these activities on learning outcomes. In this study, we investigated  the  combination  of  self-study  and  discussions at a selective Korean university.

Methods: The present study compared the two-part instructional  sequence  of  three  groups:  watching a video lecture (LD) and self-study (SD) groups, both followed  by  student-led  discussions,  and  reviewing after  watching  a  video  lecture  (LR)  group.  We  compared  test  results  using  verbatim,  paraphrased,  and transfer items. We also carried out in-depth analyses of dialogs in the discussions.

Findings: In three separate experiments, we found that the  discussion  groups  scored  significantly  higher  than the  review  group.  Moreover,  the  SD  group  performed better than the LD group of the two discussion groups. Analyses  of  dialogue  suggest  that  self-study  elicited more active and productive content from the students than lectures, leading to superior performance.

Contribution: Our  results  indicate  that  self-study  can significantly enhance the learning effect of discussions.

## Introduction

Academic learning in higher education requires diverse activities such as reading  texts,  listening  to  lectures,  holding  discussions  with  others,  and solving  related  problems  and  tasks.  These  learning  activities  are  complex,  and  each  has  its  research  agenda,  such  as  processing  models  and underlying mechanisms (see Cho et al., 2015; Dunlosky &amp; Rawson, 2019;

Mayer &amp; Alexander, 2011; Moje et al., 2020 for a general overview). For example,  reading  texts  and  listening  to  lectures  provide  students  with organized  knowledge;  discussions  enable  them  to  share  their  understanding  or  to  generate  alternative  interpretations  of  knowledge;  and solving  related  problems  is  used  to  assess  students'  knowledge  and understanding.  Thus,  except  for  classes  that  require  direct  performance, such  as  experiments  or  practices,  it  is  important  to  balance  and  align these  activities  based  on  the  learning  material's  content  and  the  student's  characteristics.

Surprisingly, however, there are relatively few studies on the effect of the combination of these activities on learning outcomes. The purpose of combining various learning activities is to enhance the learning effect.

A seminal learning sciences study found that some sequences of activities are better than other sequences and that transfer of learning is the litmus test in comparing the effectiveness of different sequences of learning (Schwartz &amp; Bransford,  1998).  In  their  Experiment  3,  Schwartz  and  Bransford  divided participants  into  three  groups.  The  first  group  was  told  to  summarize  the given  material  before  listening  to  a  lecture.  The  second  group  was  told  to analyze the material twice, and the last group was told to analyze the material before listening to a lecture. Afterward, all three groups were given a truefalse recognition test and a transfer task. They found that although there was no difference in the recognition test performance among the three groups, in the transfer task, the group which analyzed the material before listening to a lecture performed significantly better than the other two groups.

Other  studies  have  also  found  that  unique  combinations  of  learning activities promote student learning, such as the combination of an invention activity and the availability of a worked example (Schwartz &amp; Martin, 2004), studying alone beforehand and then collaborating, (Lam &amp; Muldner, 2017; Tsovaltzi et al., 2015) and generative preparation before collaboration (Lam &amp; Kapur, 2018; Mende et al., 2021). In addition, students who were taught after the problem-solving phase demonstrated significantly greater conceptual understanding and ability to transfer to novel problems than those who were taught first and then solved problems (Kapur, 2014).

We investigated a two-part instructional sequence. In the first part of the sequence, we considered self-study. Self-study is a good candidate to replace traditional lectures. In the present study, we defined self-study as individual or solitary learning to understand or master the learning material which is selected  by  capable  others  such  as  teachers  or  instructors.  Self-study  can include activities such as reading and re-reading, rehearsing, self-explaining, taking  notes,  or  drawing  a  concept  map  etc.  Still,  it  does  not  have  direct instruction, such as lectures.

Finding  replacements  for  the  traditional  didactic  lecture  is  important because  the  learning  outcome  of  lectures  is  relatively  low,  despite  their

<!-- image -->

popularity  (e.g.,  Deslauriers  et  al.,  2019;  Stains  et  al.,  2018).  Moreover, Bonawitz et al. (2011) showed that direct instruction could limit spontaneous exploration and discovery. Thus, while lectures are helpful but not crucial for learning (e.g., Bonawitz et al., 2011; Poh et al., 2010; Schmidt et al., 2010), self-study  can  provide  an  opportunity  for  learners  to  consolidate  learning better or integrate new knowledge (e.g., Fiorella &amp; Mayer, 2016). Self-study is also meaningful because it involves agency yet serves as a basis for cooperative learning, such as discussions with others (e.g., Fiorella &amp; Mayer, 2016; Lam &amp; Kapur, 2018; Lam &amp; Muldner, 2017; Mende et al., 2021). Students often find it difficult to learn cooperatively (Andrews &amp; Rapp, 2015). This difficulty can be alleviated through prior self-study because self-study activates prior knowledge, exposes knowledge gaps, and facilitates engagement.

The second part of our instructional sequence is discussions. Discussions are a common activity in the classroom, and there is a great deal of evidence that  they  are  beneficial  for  learning  (e.g.,  Murphy  et  al.,  2009,  2018;  Soter et al., 2008). Murphy et al. (2009), for example, performed a meta-analysis of 42  papers  published  between  1964  and  2003  and  found  that  high-level comprehension,  critical  thinking,  reasoning  and  argumentation  of  text improved with discussions among elementary and junior high school.

The attractiveness of discussion is that successful discussions can be one of  the  most  effective  learning  activities.  Chi  and  colleagues  (Chi  &amp;  Wylie, 2014; Chi, 2009; Menekse et al., 2013) have emphasized interactive learning activities  such  as  discussions.  They  proposed  the  Interactive-ConstructiveActive-Passive (ICAP) framework and found that academic achievement was lowest at P, then increased at A, C, and I in ascending order.

Of course, productive discussions do not take place naturally in the classroom. As McNamara et al. (1996) suggested, students should possess a basic understanding of the learning material. Murphy et al. (2016) also argued that an  effective  discussion  requires  the  participants  to  be  informed  of  relevant content beforehand and to engage in significant interactions during the discussion. We postulated that self-study, rather than lectures, can serve as the basis for productive discussions. To verify this assumption, we first checked whether self-study combined with discussion showed better learning outcomes than when a lecture was combined with discussion. Then we tried to see if the difference  was  due  to  the  content  of  the  discussion.  Analysis  of  discussion content was carried out by Chi et al. (2017), which will be described later.

In  order  to  examine  the  effect  of  discussion  on  learning,  we  also compared  the  combination  of  watching  a  lecture  and  discussion  with that  of  watching  a  lecture  and  review.  Reviewing  is  one  of  the  most common  activities  used  by  students  after  a  lecture  and  before  a  test. Even  though  reviewing  may  seem  similar  to  self-study,  we  assumed that  it  is  more  likely  a  passive  activity  because  participants  were  likely to  be  already  affected  by  the  lecture,  similar  to  the  kindergartners  who

<!-- image -->

watched  demonstrations  in  Bonawitz  et  al.  (2011)'s  study.  However, there  is  no  reason  to  hold  discussions  if  student-led  discussions  are not  more  effective  than  students'  reviewing.  Thus,  we  wanted  to  check whether  student-led  discussion  leads  to  better  learning  than  reviewing.

To compare learning outcomes across different combinations, assessments incorporating  tests,  essay  writing,  complex  problem  solving,  or  interpersonal skills  can  be  used  (e.g.,  Schmidt  et  al.,  2009).  In  this  study,  a  test  of  learning content  was  used,  including  transfer  and  memory  problems.  Thus,  the  test questions were made up of a mix up of verbatim, paraphrased, and transfer items.

Our hypotheses are as follows:

- ● Hypothesis 1: Self-study combined with discussion will produce better learning  outcomes measured by a mix of verbatim, paraphrased, and transfer items than watching a video lecture combined with discussion.
- ● Hypothesis 2: As the second part of the instructional sequence, discussion groups will score higher than the review group.
- ● Hypothesis  3:  One  mechanism  of  enhanced  learning  will  be  greater activity  and  productivity, as  measured by coding the types of student utterances during the discussion, which is preceded by self-study.

## EXPERIMENT 1: Does combining self-study and discussion promote learning?

In Experiment 1, participants were divided into three groups: reviewing after watching  a  video  lecture  (Lecture  Review:  LR),  discussion  after  watching a  video  lecture  (Lecture  Discussion:  LD),  and  discussion  after  self-study (Self-Study Discussion: SD). The final test scores of the three groups were compared. Across all three experiments, we will use a value of p &lt; .05 to judge significance. We predicted that the combination of self-study and discussion would  produce  learning  outcomes  significantly  higher  than  watching a  lecture  and  discussion  (Hypothesis 1).  To examine the learning effect of discussions, we also compared the LR group and the LD  group (Hypothesis  2).  Thus,  we  predicted  that  learning  performance  would  be higher in ascending order of LR, LD, and SD.

## Methods

## Participants and design

Undergraduate students at a selective university in Seoul participated in this experiment. All experiments were approved by the university's Institutional Review  Board  (IRB,  No.  2004/003-017).  The  majors  of  undergraduate

<!-- image -->

students  included  psychology,  economics,  physics,  computer  engineering, etc.,  and  there  was  no  significant  difference  in  the  number  of  students  by major. Ninety students signed up, but two left during the experiment, thus leaving  37  men  and  51  women.  All  the  participants  were  Korean.  The participants were randomly assigned to three different groups: LR ( n = 30), LD  ( n = 29, G ,  number  of  discussion  groups = 9),  and  SD  ( n = 29, G = 9). Three or four students formed a discussion group. There were no significant differences in age among the groups: LR group ( Mage = 20.47, SDage = 1.94), LD group ( Mage = 20.31, SDage = 2.05),  and  SD  group  ( Mage = 19.69, SDage = 1.53).

## Materials and procedure

Background knowledge (Beyer, 1987; Miyake &amp; Norman, 1979) can have an influence on test scores. Therefore, we used topics that covered the criminal procedure  code,  accusation  and  charge  for  our  learning  material  (see, Appendix A). The topic was chosen because it was less likely to be affected by background knowledge since the courses on law are not available as an undergraduate  course  in  South  Korea.  Even  so,  to  make  sure  that  the participants  did  not  have  significant  background  knowledge,  they  were given  a  background  knowledge  survey.  The  survey  used  a  seven-point Likert scale, 1 (having no knowledge) to 7 (having expert knowledge) over the six topics, including the criminal procedure code, accusation and charge (two  topics  relevant  to  this  study),  and  the  genome  project,  civil  law,  the legalization  of  same-sex  marriage  and  the  Special  Act  on  Sexual  Violence (four topics irrelevant to this study).

After  the  background  survey  was  completed,  the  participants  were  randomly assigned to three different  groups. Different  groups of students conducted learning in different locations, and there was one experimenter in each setting.  All groups received the same written instructional material after the survey. The written instructional material was seven pages long and contained information covered in the video lecture. However, it was not a transcription of the  video  clip.  The  instructional  video  clip  used  in  the  experiment  corresponded to lecture-style monologue sessions. The video clip was a lecture on law available on the internet. The video clip was 18 minutes long.

The  LR  group  watched  the  18-minute  video  lecture  with  the  provided written instructional material and subsequently studied on their own for 18 minutes  with  only  the  written  material.  During  review,  students  were  not able to ask the instructor questions and were told to prepare for a test based on the video lecture and learning materials. Participants could take notes or underline content in the written material while taking a lecture, reviewing, self-studying on their own or discussing. The LD group watched the video lecture  with  the  instructional  material  and  subsequently  discussed  for  18

<!-- image -->

minutes in groups of three or four. While watching the video clip, the LR and the LD groups could not manipulate it such as stopping or rewinding. Lastly, the SD group studied the written material by themselves and subsequently discussed for 18 minutes in groups of three or four. Groups that had discussions were able to participate in discussions with the written materials.

To  minimize  the  experimenter's  interference  during  the  discussion among the participants, the experimenter did not intervene while the students were learning (e.g., during review, self-study, and discussion). At the beginning of the discussion, the experimenter mentioned the end time of the discussion and informed that a test would be conducted after the discussion. The experimenter did not comment on the direction or the format of the discussion  and  just  stated  to  freely  exchange  what  they  have  learned. Participants  were  not  allowed  to  ask  questions  to  the  experimenter.  In other  words,  the  experimenter  did  not  give  further  instructions  and  did not engage in any intervention during the discussions.

After their learning activities, all three groups took a 20-minute test on the given material. The test questions were divided into three types as shown in Appendix B.

- (1)  Verbatim  items  consisted  of  multiple  choice  or  short  answer  questions.  These  questions  asked  straightforward  information  from  the lecture or the written material. ( Ten possible points for ten questions ). An  example  of  the  item  is:  'Who  does  not  have  the  right  to  file a  complaint?,'  followed  by  answer  choices  of  1)  Legal  representatives  2)  Property  manager  3)  Guardian  4)  A  representative  of  the corporation which is the victim. Each item was worth 1 point.
- (2)  Paraphrased  items.  These  were  items  that  tested  knowledge  of  concepts from the given material. Students had to explain concepts from the lecture or the written material. (A total of t wenty-two points for six questions ). Unlike verbatim items, paraphrased items required explanations or descriptions and partial credit could be given. An example of this item is 'Explain who the entitled person with the right to file a complaint is.'
- (3) Transfer items. These items required students to utilize their understanding of the whole content and apply it in new situations. (A total of e ighteen points for four questions ). Like paraphrased items, transfer items required explanations and partial credit was available. However, unlike paraphrased items which required reiteration of the presented material, transfer items sought to assess how much transfer of learning took  place  using  legal  case  scenarios.  An  example  of  this  item  is  as follows.  'On  May  1st,  2016  the  father  (F)  of  a  famous  under-aged celebrity (V), accused person (D) of infringement on privacy claiming that  D  had  hacked  V's  computer.  However,  F's  parental  rights  on

V were terminated on January 1st, 2017. D was charged with infringement on privacy and was convicted guilty at the first trial. Eventually, D  made  an  appeal  claiming  that  F  has  no  right  to  file  a  complaint because his parental rights were terminated. Thus, D claims that the accusation should be dropped. Will the Court of Appeals accept D's claim?  Students  could  receive  partial  points  in  cases  of  paraphrased and transfer items because several key concepts and expressions were involved.  In  order  to  increase  grading  objectivity,  30%  of  the  total answer sheets were randomly selected and graded by two raters. We confirmed that there was no rater discrepancy for verbatim items. For paraphrased  and  transfer  items,  the  raters'  agreement  measured  by Intraclass correlation [ICC (3, k )] was .90 and .90 respectively for the following analyses. Thus, the remaining answer sheets were graded by the first author. We also set the criterion for outliers at above or below two-standard  deviation  from  the  mean,  and  there  was  none.  Thus, significant experimental effect could not be due to outliers.

All materials such as the video lecture, the written instructional material, and the test questions were previously reviewed by legal experts and modified when necessary. In particular, experts examined whether the test items corresponded to the three types we classified, and whether the duration of the time compared to the time spent in learning and the score for each item were appropriate.

## Results

The results of  the  background  knowledge survey showed that most of the participants  had  almost  no  knowledge on the  given content.  The  students had low self-reported knowledge of the two relevant topics.

The  mean  and  standard  deviation  of  the  test  scores  are  presented  in Table  1.  Analysis  of  variance  (ANOVA)  was  conducted  to  examine  the differences between the groups for the different types of test items according to our hypotheses.

Significant differences were found among the groups in the means of the verbatim  and  transfer  items,  and  total  means.  There  was  no  significant difference in the means of the paraphrased items.

Subsequent planned comparisons revealed that the total mean of the SD group  was  significantly  higher  than  that  of  the  LD  group, t (85) = 3.26, p = .012, d = .88,  and  that  of  the  LR  group, t (85) = 4.29, p &lt; .001, d = 1.05. However,  there  was  no  difference  between  the  LR  and  the  LD  groups, t (85) = 1.00, p = .320, d = .26.

For the verbatim items, the SD group scored significantly higher than the LD  group, t (85) = 2.76, p = .007, d = .64,  and  the  LR  group, t (85) = 2.63,

|-------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-------|-------|---------|--------------|
| Total Score (50 points) | 33.48 ( 4.58 )  | 34.62 ( 3.72 )  | 38.41 ( 4.74 )  | 10.01 | &lt;.001 |    0.19 | LR ≈ LD &lt; SD |

| Paraphrased (22 points) | 17.93 ( 2.24 )  | 19.00 ( 2.30 )  | 18.93 ( 2.69 )  |  1.79 | .173  |    0.04 | LR ≈ LD ≈ SD |
| Transfer (18 point)     | 8.47 ( 2.76 )   | 10.31 ( 2.66 )  | 12.21 ( 2.76 )  | 13.86 | &lt;.001 |    0.25 | LR &lt; LD &lt; SD |

Note .  Mean scores for the total and the three different types of items as a function of different learning activities. LR = Lecture Review group; LD = Lecture Discussion group; SD = Self-study Discussion group.

p = .010, d = .46. However, there was no significant difference between the LR and the LD groups.

For the paraphrased items, there was no significant difference between the three groups; SD, LD, and LR.

For the transfer items, the SD group scored significantly higher than the LD group,  (85) = 2.65, t p = .010, d = .69,  and  the  LR  group, t (85) = 5.27, p &lt; .001, d = 1.32. In addition, the LD group scored significantly higher than the LR group,  (85) = 2.60, t p = .012, d = .65.

Although there was no significant  difference  among  the  groups  for  the paraphrased  items,  possibly  due  to  the  ceiling  effect  (out  of  22  points  the means were over 18 points), the results support our predictions. In line with Hypothesis 1, the combination of self-study and discussion improved learning  outcomes  more  than  that  of  watching  a  lecture  and  discussion.  In addition, in line with our second prediction (Hypothesis 2) that stated that discussions  will  promote  greater  learning  than  reviewing,  the  LD  and  SD group scored much higher than the LR group in the transfer items in the final test.

## EXPERIMENT 2: Is self-study better than lectures in immediate learning?

Experiment 1 showed that combining self-study and discussions can lead to effective  learning.  However,  a  counterargument  regarding  the  second hypothesis  could  be  raised.  One  could  argue  that  the  reason  why  the  SD group scored higher than the LD group was simply that self-study was more effective  than  watching  a  lecture.  In  other  words,  it  is  possible  that  the significant difference in scores between the SD and LD groups was due to differences in learning efficacy before holding a discussion. In order to rule out the possibility that the difference in learning outcome occurred simply because of the different preliminary activities themselves, the final test was administered immediately after the learning activity, i.e., self-study (S) and watching a lecture (L). The lack of significant difference between the S and the  L  groups  would  support  our  hypothesis  that  there  is  an  interaction between the preliminary activity and the subsequent discussion.

## Methods

## Participants, materials, and procedure

Fifty-two undergraduate students who did not participate in Experiment 1 participated in the experiment. Of the fifty-two students who signed up, two did not finish the experiment, leaving 38 men and 12 women. There were no significant differences in age among the groups. L group ( Mage = 20.40, SDage = 1.63),  S  group  ( Mage = 20.84, SDage = 1.97).  Participants  were  randomly assigned to one of the two groups: L (Lecture, n = 25), and S (Self-study, n = 25). Procedures and instructional materials were the same as Experiment 1, except that the discussion was replaced by a survey. The survey was about image evaluation, irrelevant to the learning content. Specifically, the L group watched  the  video  lecture  for  18 minutes  with  the  written  instructional material and then completed the survey for 18 minutes. Participants of the S  group  studied  the  learning  material  by  themselves  for  18 minutes  and subsequently completed the survey for 18 minutes.

## Results

Similar to Experiment 1, participants showed little relevant knowledge and there  was  no  significant  difference  in  the  mean  between  the  two  groups. Among the participants, there were no outliers.

The test scores from Experiment 2 are provided in Figure 1, along with the results from Experiment 1. As expected, there was no difference between the two groups in all types of items.

The total means, verbatim items, paraphrased items, and transfer items between Experiments 1 and 2 (i.e., five groups) were significantly different, F (4, 133) = 25.82, p &lt; .001, partial-eta squared =.44; F (4, 133) = 10.61, p &lt; .001, partial-eta squared =.24; F (4, 133) = 12.64, p &lt; .001, partial-eta squared =.28; F (4, 133) = 16.03, p &lt; .001, partial-eta squared =.33, respectively.

We carried out a post hoc analysis using the Tukey test to find out any difference between two experiments. The total means of the L group ( M = 27.52, SD = 5.03) and the S group ( M = 27.52, SD = 5.89) were significantly lower than those of the three groups of Experiment 1, ps &lt; .001. The L group ( M = 4.96, SD = 1.46) scored significantly lower than other three groups in verbatim items, ps &lt; .01, and the S group ( M = 5.60, SD = 1.58) scored only lower than the SD group, p &lt; .001. The L group ( M = 15.40, SD = 3.14) and the S group ( M = 14.48, SD = 4.52) scored significantly lower than the other three  groups  in  the  paraphrased  items, ps &lt;  .05.  For  transfer  items,  the L group ( M = 7.16, SD = 2.73) and the S group ( M = 7.44, SD = 3.00) scored significantly lower than the two discussion groups, ps &lt; .01, but showed no significant difference from the LR group. These results suggest that discussions enhance scores for paraphrased and transfer items.

The results of Experiment 2 suggest that the different outcomes from the LD and the SD groups in Experiment 1 were not because of the direct effect of  the  difference  in  preliminary  activity,  but  because  of  the  interaction between the preliminary activity and the discussion.

## EXPERIMENT 3: Why is the combination of self-study and discussion better?

The goals of Experiment 3 were twofold. One was to replicate the results of Experiment 1 to find out the difference between the SD and the LD groups. The other was to analyze the content of the discussions of the two groups. We hypothesized that the discussions of the SD group would be more active and productive than those of the LD group (Hypothesis 3). We then explored the  relationship  between  specific  factors  in  the  discussion  content  and students' learning.

## Methods

## Participants, materials, and procedure

Another seventy-four students who did not participate in Experiment 1 or 2 participated  in  this  experiment  (32  men  and  42  women).  There  were  no

significant  differences  in  age  among  the  groups:  LD  group  ( Mage = 20.30, SDage = 1.47, G = 10),  and  SD  group  ( Mage = 20.54, SDage = 2.30, G = 10). There were no outliers among the participants. Procedures were the same as in Experiment 1, except for the following two changes. One was that the only SD and LD groups were included in the experiment. The other change was  that  all  the  discussions  were  recorded.  As  in  Experiment  1,  at  the beginning of the discussion, the experimenter notified the end time of the discussion and informed that a test would be conducted after the discussion. Participants were not allowed to ask questions to the experimenter.

## Coding of discussion in small groups

As mentioned above, the present study followed Chi et al. (2017) in analyzing the content of the discussions. They categorized meaningful content of the discussions into three major types: substantive comments, interaction episodes and co-constructive turns. Substantive comments are defined as meaningful contributions in ongoing discussions, such as a relevant response to the  concept  taught  or  learned  on  one's  own  to  other  group  members. Interaction  episodes  refer  to  coherent  conversations  among  members  that include at least one substantive comment. A co-constructive turn is defined as  a  conversation  that  includes  'a  change  in  a  speaker  that  contains  substantive  contributions  from  at  least  two  speakers.'  We  predicted  that  the discussion  within  the  SD  group  would  contain  more  meaningful  content than  the  discussion  within  the  LD  group.  A  detailed  explanation  is  given below in the method section.

In the detailed coding scheme, each transcript was segmented according to speaker turns. A turn, by definition, is speech by a single speaker (Traum &amp;  Heeman,  1997).  When  successive  conversational  turns  among  group members  are  about  the  same  topic,  they  form  an  episode.  An  episode  is a multi-turn conversation on the same topic and line of thought that includes at least one substantive comment. The example of topics of the lecture and instructional material were shown in Appendix A. When a group discussed topic  A  and  then  topic  B,  then  topic  A  again,  they  were  coded  as  three different  episodes.  A  turn  within  an  episode  is  judged  to  be  a  substantive comment when it refers to questions and conversations related to concepts of the  lecture  or  the  written  instructional  material.  Only  the  relevance  of  the comments  to  concepts  was  considered,  regardless  of  the  accuracy  of  the comments. For example, the following comments and questions were judged to be substantive: 'What exactly is an offense subject to complaint? Does it mean punishment is possible if there are charges?' (Related to the concept of offense subject to complaint), 'Then if the relative is the suspect, how do you file a complaint? I actually don't understand this part either, but if the relative is the suspect, what does it mean to independently charge the relatives? What

<!-- image -->

does it mean by the independent victim?' (Related to the legal representative concept  of  victim).  In  contrast,  comments  irrelevant  to  the  topic  such  as 'Yes,' 'Umm' or 'Maybe' were judged as non-substantive comments.

When two or more of the group members consecutively make substantive comments within an episode, it is called an interaction episode. Thus, in an interaction  episode,  at  least  two  different  members  of  the  group  needs  to make at least one substantive comment as shown in the interaction episode 1 of Appendix C.

A co-constructive turn is a special case of an interaction episode, in that there is 'a change in the speaker that contains substantive contributions from both speakers' (Chi et al., 2017). An example can be seen in the interaction episode 2 of Appendix C. Student 4 asked a question regarding the offense subject to complaint, which is a substantive comment. Student 5 then made a  substantive  comment  answering  the  question.  Then  Student  6  made another substantive comment that explained the importance of the relationship in the offenses subject to complaints. These comments form a sequential turn of substantive comments, i.e., a co-constructive turn.

To summarize, productive discussions are characterized by more substantive comments and interaction episodes in conversations among students, and more substantive comments and co-constructive turns in interaction episodes.

## Results

Similar  to  Experiment  1  and  2,  most  of  the  participants  had  almost  no knowledge  on  the  given  content,  and  there  was  no  significant  difference between the two groups. The average and standard deviation of the results of final test from Experiment 3 are provided in Table 2.

The results showed that the SD group performed better than the LD group in total score, verbatim, and transfer items. Thus, the results of Experiment 1 were successfully replicated for different participants.

## Analysis of discussions

As described in the methods section, we adhered to Chi and her colleagues (Chi  et  al.,  2008,  2017)  in  analyzing  the  content  of  the  discussions.

Twenty percent of the discussion videos (two from the SD group and two from the LD group) were randomly selected and transcribed and coded by two raters: the first author and a graduate student. The raters were blind to conditions. They agreed on 306 phrases uttered by the students within the discussion  groups  (96%  of  the  total).  The  rater  agreement  measured  by Kappa was over .90 for the following analyses. Thus, the remaining 80% of the videos were transcribed by the first author.

Results from the coded data are presented in Table 3. The SD group had significantly higher frequency of substantive comments compared to the LD group  (37.80  vs.  15.20, p = .020, d = 1.18).  As  for  the  interaction  episode, there was no significant difference between the two groups (3.80 vs. 5.50. p = .205, d = .59). However, the number of substantive comments per interaction episode was significantly greater in the SD group than in the LD group (6.85 vs. 2.43, p = .003, d = 1.60). Finally, the number of co-constructive turns per interaction episode from the SD group significantly exceeded that from the LD group (4.45 vs. 1.79, p = .025, d = 1.10).

Summarizing  the  results  above,  the  groups  that  studied  by  themselves before discussion made more substantive comments, and also received higher scores on transfer items. These results suggest that substantive comments may have a direct impact on the performance of transfer items. To examine whether substantive comments had direct impact on the outcome of transfer items, an exploratory regression analysis was performed. The in-group members' average score of transfer items was set as the dependent variable and the number of substantive  comments  as  explanatory  variable.  The  results  showed  that  the effect of substantive comments on transfer items was significant, F (1, 18) = 5.38, p = .032, R 2 = .23. The results are presented in Table 4.

The findings  support  our  Hypothesis  3  that  postulated  that  the  discussions of the SD group would be more active and productive than those of the LD group. This was evidenced by the SD group generating more substantive comments and engaging in a greater number of co-constructive turns than the LD group. Moreover, the amount of substantive comments affected the final test scores positively.

## Discussion

In this study, we examined a two-part instructional sequence of self-study and discussions (SD) in higher education. In order to compare the efficacy of this combination with the most widely used format in typical college classes, we included the Lecture-Review (LR) combination. We also compared the SD  combination  with  the  Lecture-Discussion  (LD)  combination  to  determine which preparatory activity enhances the learning effect of discussions. The research hypotheses were: i) the learning outcome would be SD &gt; LD &gt; LR  (Hypothesis  1  and  Hypothesis  2),  ii)  the  discussions  of  the  SD  group would  be  more  active  and  productive  than  those  of  the  LD  group (Hypothesis 3).

To test our hypotheses, we conducted three experiments. In Experiment 1, we compared the test scores of three conditions: LR, LD, and SD. Apart from the  fact  that  there  was  no  significant  difference  among  the  groups  for paraphrased  items,  the  results  supported  our  predictions.  In  line  with Hypothesis 1, self-study and discussion improved learning outcomes more than watching a lecture and discussion. In addition, in line with Hypothesis 2, which states that discussions will promote greater learning than reviewing, the LD group scored much higher than the LR group in the transfer items.

In Experiment 2, we examined the possibility whether preliminary activities alone regardless of subsequent discussions, could lead to different outcomes.  A  lecture  group  and  a  self-study  group  took  the  final  test  without holding a discussion, and there was no difference in the test scores between the two groups. Thus, we verified that the different outcomes from the LD and the SD groups in Experiment 1 resulted from the interaction between the preliminary activity and the discussion. The result was especially meaningful in that the scores for transfer items showed a significant difference.

In Experiment 3, we examined the content of discussions between SD and the LD groups. Consistent with Hypothesis 3, the results showed that the SD group  made  more  constructive  and  productive  comments  than  the  LD group. Although the mean number of interaction episodes was not different between the two discussion groups, this may be due to the small number of interaction  episodes.  Therefore,  to  examine  the  difference  in  a  follow-up study,  it  seems  necessary  to  increase  the  number  of  key  concepts  in  the

<!-- image -->

learning  material  or  to  perform  a  finer-grained  analysis  of  the  interaction quality.

Considering the results of previous studies by Chi (2009, 2014), it is not surprising  that  the  discussion  groups  outperformed  the  review  group  and that discussions are a very effective learning activity. Nevertheless, we were able to demonstrate for the first time that when self-study is combined with discussion,  it  leads  to  more  productive  discussion  than  when  a  lecture  is combined with discussion.

So,  why  would  self-study  lead  to  a  more  productive  discussion  than watching a lecture? One speculation is as follows: compared to listening to a  lecture,  self-study  can  provide  students  with  relatively  more  time  for reflection.  During  self-study,  students  can  concentrate  on  parts  they  want to focus on while skipping through others. In a lecture, on the other hand, information is delivered at a constant rate. As a result, the students in the self-study group are more likely to mark parts they did not understand. The marked parts may not be helpful for immediate learning, but they can be drawn  out  during  discussions.  Thus,  the  subsequent  discussion  would  be more productive and lead to better learning outcomes.

Since the present research is at a preliminary stage and our explanation is provided  as  post  hoc  and  hypothetical,  its  validity  needs  to  be  confirmed through follow-up studies. One limitation of this study is that the participants were students enrolled at a highly selective university in South Korea. Therefore, the study needs to be expanded to cover a variety of populations. In particular, it would be desirable to explore whether this method is effective even for elementary, middle and high school students.

Another  limitation  is  that  only  one  subject  (i.e.,  law)  matter  was  used. Although using obscure topics helps to ensure the internal validity of our experiments, it lowers the external validity in typical educational contexts in which students have diverse prior background knowledge. Thus, it would be worthwhile  to  expand  experiment  to  different  subjects,  including  science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) courses.

In addition, it is worth pointing out that we utilized student-led discussions. We know that teacher-led discussions improve students' understanding (e.g., Almasi &amp; Garas-York, 2014; Sweller et al., 2007). The benefits come from the direct scaffolding during the discussion and the summative feedback afterward (Murphy et al., 2016; Sweller et al., 2007). However, many researchers argue that when teachers let go of their control and authority and act as facilitators, students' questions, co-construction, and learning increase (Schmidt et al., 2007; Soter et al., 2008; Wei &amp; Murphy, 2017). Thus, future research should investigate the difference between the two discussion types in their processes and effectiveness.

Nevertheless, the results of this study can contribute to learning sciences by  drawing  attention  to  the  topic  of  self-study  and  the  combination  of

<!-- image -->

learning activities. Self-study is essential when we acquire knowledge, solidify what we have learned from others, or reflectively examine what we know. Thus,  it  is  important  to  understand  self-study  to  better  enhance  students' learning.  Despite  its  importance,  however,  not  many  studies  on  self-study have been conducted so far.

There is also a need for more research that examines combinations of two or more learning activities. In addition to the combination of self-study and discussions  covered  in  this  study,  we  can  explore  the  learning  effects  of combinations such as self-study, discussion, and writing; self-study, writing, and discussion;  problem-solving and  instruction;  or  problem-  solving  and self-study.

Furthermore,  a  practical  contribution  of  this  study  is  that  it  suggests specific class activities that can replace traditional lectures. Despite the fact that  lectures  are  not  conducive  to  student  learning  compared  to  students' (inter) active learning, they are still the most widely used form of instruction in the classroom (e.g., Deslauriers et al., 2019; Freeman et al., 2014; Stains et al., 2018). In this context, the combination of self-study and discussion is a promising activity that can replace traditional lectures. Thus, the present study  can  help  educational  stakeholders  in  higher  education  who  may  be looking for effective replacements for traditional lectures. It would be desirable to provide students with more opportunities to study on their own and to track the process and results by individuals or groups (e.g., Lam &amp; Kapur, 2018; Mende et al., 2021; Schmidt et al., 2007). The tracking process involves asking  the  students  to  voice  the  difficulties  or  questions  that  they  faced during self-study. The instructor can use this information to help students not  only  to  digest  the  material,  but  also  further  their  investigation  of  the topic. In addition, self-study can go beyond the scope of the present study to include  more  self-directed  and  open  efforts,  such  as  initial  exploration  of a topic, idea generation, and self-directed search of information to address unknowns.

Therefore, after more research and evidence that support their effectiveness,  a  significant  portion  of  class  time  can  be  devoted  to  student-led activities  such  as  self-study  and  discussion,  leading  to  better  learning  outcomes. We hope that future follow-up studies on student-led learning activities and strategies will shed new light on the learning sciences and lead to more effective education.

## Appendix B. Samples of three types of test questions: Verbatim, paraphrased, and transfer items

## Examples of verbatim items

- 1.  Given  that  there  is  no  one  who  filed  an  accusation  against  a  crime  subject  for prosecution, prosecutors must designate a person who can file the complaint within () days upon the request of the stakeholders. (Answer: 10)
- 2. Who does not have the right to file a complaint? (Answer: number 2)
- (1) Legal representatives
- (2) Property manager
- (3) Guardian
- (4) A representative of the corporation which is the victim
- 7. According to Article 223, a victim of a crime has the right to accuse the offender. However, although the victim cannot accuse the one's relatives nor his/her spouse, () is an exception. (Answer: sexual crime)

## Examples of paraphrased items

- 11. Explain who the entitled person with the right to file a complaint is.

<!-- image -->

(Answer: Provided that there is no one to make the accusation (in case of an offense subject  to  complaint),  prosecutors  shall  designate  the  person  with  the  right  to  file a complaint within 10 days upon request by stakeholders.)

- 12. Define who the victim is and explain the cases where he/she is unable to make an accusation.

(Answer: A victim is a person whose life, body, property, or fame has been infringed upon or threatened. The victim cannot accuse the offender if he/she is one's or his/her spouse's linear ascendants.)

- 13. Explain the following concepts: accusation, complaint, recognition. Discuss their common features.

(Answer:  Accusation:  an  expression  of  will  by  the  victim  of  a  crime  or  a  person representing the victim; Complaint: an expression of will by the third party or witness; Recognition: the most basic way that the investigative authority initiates an investigation. Common feature: they occur at the beginning of an investigation.)

## Examples of transfer items

- 17. The under-aged victim (V) accused the offender (D) of contempt, and then withdrew his accusation on July 26th, 2017. Afterwards V's mother (M), the legal representative of V, accused D on August 3rd, 2017. D was charged with contempt and was found guilty on the first trial. However, D made an appeal claiming M's complaint is not valid because V has already withdrawn his complaint, and thus, the prosecutor's indictment is against the provisions of the law. Will the Court of Appeals accept D's claim? (Answer: A legal representative of an under-aged victim can independently file a complaint regardless of whether the victim's complaint is nullified. Such complaint can even go against the victim's stated  will.  Thus,  even  if  victim  V  withdraws  his  accusation,  the  complaint  of  V's  legal representative M is still effective. In conclusion, the Court of Appeals will reject D's claim.)
- 18.  On  May  1st,  2016  the  father  (F)  of  a  famous  under-aged  celebrity  (V), accused person (D) of infringement on privacy claiming that D has hacked V's computer.  However,  F's  parental  rights  on  V  were  terminated  on  January  1st, 2017.  D  was  charged  with  infringement  on  privacy  and  was  convicted  guilty on the first trial.  Eventually, D made an appeal claiming that F has no right to file  a  complaint  because  his  parental  rights  were  terminated.  Thus,  D  claims that  the  accusation  should  be  dropped.  Will  the  Court  of  Appeals  accept  D's claim? (Answer:  The  status  of  a  legal  representative  must  be  determined  based on  the  day  of  the  accusation.  If  the  status  was  valid  on  the  day  of  accusation, the  loss  of  status  at  the  time  of  the  crime  or  after  the  accusation  does  not invalidate  the  accusation.  In  conclusion,  even  if  F's  parental  rights  on  V  were terminated  after  the  day  of  accusation,  F's  complaint  is  still  valid.  Thus,  the Court  of  Appeals  will  reject  D's  claim.)

## Appendix C. Examples of interaction and non-interaction episodes

| Interaction  Episode 1      | Student 1: Are there crimes that correspond to  relative offense subject to complaint?                                                                                                                                                  | Turn  1                                                                                                                                                          | Co-Constructive turn   |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| Interaction                 | Student 2: It doesn't say that there are crimes  related to relative or absolute offense subject to  complaint. Rather crimes such contempt, is  a prime example of offense subject to  complaint.                                      | Turn  2                                                                                                                                                          | Co-Constructive turn   |
|                             | Student 3: In other words, doesn't it mean that  offenses subject to complaints are categorized  by relationships rather than the type of crime?  Therefore, contempt can either be absolute or  relative offense subject to complaint. | Turn  3                                                                                                                                                          |                        |
| Episode 2                   | Student 4: I'm curious why the crime not  prosecuted against objection subject to charge.  Since the prosecutor can indict without  accusation, it cannot be charge, can it be  categorized as recognition?                             | Turn  1                                                                                                                                                          | Co-Constructive turn   |
|                             | Student 5: I think it can be recognition or  accusation. You can initiate the investigation  with accusation, or with recognition without  accusation.                                                                                  | Turn  2                                                                                                                                                          | Co-Constructive turn   |
|                             | Student 6: That's right, I understand it this way.  That there are two types of crime, offenses  subject to complaint or not subject to complaint  or not subject to complaint. Sexual offenses are  in a separate category.            | Turn  3                                                                                                                                                          |                        |
| Non-Interaction  Episode 1* | Student 7: I don't understand what dual liability is. Here in this  part about offense subject to complaint.                                                                                                                            | Student 7: I don't understand what dual liability is. Here in this  part about offense subject to complaint.                                                     | Turn 1                 |
| Non-Interaction  Episode 2* | Student 8: Me, neither. Student 9: Are minors really seen as incapable of making regal  decisions? Student 10: Once they reach high school age, they can be seen                                                                        | Student 8: Me, neither. Student 9: Are minors really seen as incapable of making regal  decisions? Student 10: Once they reach high school age, they can be seen |                        |

Note .  Each  turn  is  a  substantive  turn.  Student  1,  2,  3  . . .  and  11  denote  independent  speakers.  NonInteraction episodes contain no co-constructive turns.
