## Abstract

The purpose of this study was to develop a reliable and valid instrument to measure self-directedness in learning among college students based on an operationalization of the personal responsibility orientation (PRO) model of self-direction in learning. The resultant 25-item Personal Responsibility Orientation to Self-Direction in Learning Scale (PRO-SDLS) was found to be a highly reliable instrument in the selected sample of  graduate  and  undergraduate  education  students.  Confirmatory  factor  analysis established that a four latent variable model fit the data. Scores from the PRO-SDLS were significantly related to criterion variables thought to demonstrate self-direction and to a known instrument of self-direction while accounting for additional variance. Recommendations for further research in the ongoing process of scale validation and implications for practice are provided.

Self-direction has long been recognized as an important component in adults' learning activities. However, almost without exception, the same adult educators who cite the centrality of this concept to adult learning suggest that confusion and controversy exist with the nature and application of the concept. In an attempt to more clearly conceptualize and define self-direction, various authors (such as Brockett &amp; Hiemstra, 1991; Caffarella, 1993; Garrison, 1997; Long, 1998; Merriam, Caffarella, &amp; Baumgartner, 2007) have reviewed and categorized the large number of publications dealing with this concept. Consistent across these sources are separate conceptualizations of selfdirection as a process of learning in which people take the primary responsibility or initiative in the learning experience and as a personal attribute of the learner.

However, when Brockett and Hiemstra (1991) proposed the personal responsibility orientation (PRO) model of self-direction in learning, they conceptualized these views as complementary and related. Within their model, self-direction in learning is viewed both as 'instructional method processes (self-directed learning) and personality characteristics  of  the  individual  learner  (learner  self-direction)'  (p.  26).  Both  components, operating within the learner's social context, contribute to the outcome of self-direction in learning. Yet, in the nearly two decades since its introduction, little empirical evidence has been gathered to explore this model.

Merriam, Caffarella, and Baumgartner (2007) suggest that one reason for the slow development of a rich research agenda in self-directed learning is the lack of databased studies and critical discussion about recently developed conceptual models of self-directed learning. Compounding this lack of empirical confirmation about recent conceptual models is the reliance of most quantitative investigators on an unrevised instrument developed in 1977: L. M. Guglielmino's (1977) Self-Directed Learning Readiness Scale (SDLRS). The SDLRS has made a clear and strong contribution in terms of looking at SDL vis-à-vis a host of research and practice concepts. However, it has also faced various challenges over the years. A debate beginning in the 1980s (e.g., Bonham, 1991; Brockett, 1985; Field, 1989) centering on the validity of this scale remains largely unresolved today (J. D. Hoban, Lawson, Mazmanian, Best, &amp; Seibel, 2005), even though there remains widespread support for use of the instrument.

This article addresses the need to empirically validate new ways of studying selfdirection that are informed by more recent conceptualizations of self-direction, such as the PRO model of self-direction in learning (Brockett &amp; Hiemstra, 1991). Accomplishing this purpose involved three stages: (a) the identification and operationalization of psychometrically sound and reliable scale items based on the PRO model, (b) the model validation through confirmatory factor analyses of the PRO model fit to the data from items chosen by experts as clearly representative of the PRO model factors, and (c) the validation of the developed scale with other related measures of self-direction.

## Conceptual Framework

The PRO model of self-direction in learning (Brockett &amp; Hiemstra, 1991) is an umbrella concept (Figure 1) that provides a definitional foundation for understanding and recognizing differences and similarities in 'self-directed learning' as a teaching

Figure 1. The 'personal responsibility orientation' model Note. Adapted from Brockett and Hiemstra (1991).

and learning transaction external to the individual and 'learner self-direction' as a personal orientation internal to the individual. Together they predispose one toward personal empowerment and accepting responsibility for such learning.

Brockett and Hiemstra (1991) stress personal responsibility as the connection or central concept for understanding self-direction as it is represented and described in their model. They state that 'by personal responsibility we mean that individuals assume  ownership  for  their  thoughts  and  actions'  (p.  26).  Hiemstra  and  Brockett (1994) in a later publication suggest the concept of personal ownership can 'also be thought of as the personal values we attach to making decisions, taking control, or accepting  responsibility  for  our  beliefs  and  actions'  (p.  2).  Brockett  and  Hiemstra further suggest Maslow's (1970) concept of 'self-actualization, and the people who demonstrate high levels of this characteristic, epitomize personal responsibility-as we have used this term within the context of the PRO model' (p. 126). Brockett and Hiemstra locate their model within a humanistic perspective, stressing individuals' positive potentials for growth.

Therefore, within the authors' model (Brockett &amp; Hiemstra, 1991), self-direction in learning is viewed both as a behavior seen in instructional method processes (selfdirected learning) and a personality characteristic of the individual learner (learner self-direction).  Both  components  are  embedded  within  a  personal  responsibility framework and operating within the learner's social environment contribute to the outcome  of  self-direction  in  learning.  This  is  consistent  with  certain  portions

of  subsequent  models  of  self-direction.  Both  Grow  (1991)  and  Garrison  (1997) acknowledge the importance of the learner-teacher transaction, and both discuss the importance  of  learners'  perceptions  of  motivation  and  control.  For  the  purpose  of empirically exploring the validity of the PRO model, the processes and characteristics the authors conceptualized are further defined and operationalized below.

## The Teaching-Learning Transaction (TLT)

Brockett  and  Hiemstra  (1991)  define  the  self-directed  learning  component  as  a 'process in which a learner assumes primary responsibility for planning, implementing, and evaluating the learning process. An education agent or resource often plays a facilitating role in the process' (p. 24). This process dimension focuses on external factors or characteristics of the teaching-learning experience and a learner's willingness to accept personal responsibility accomplishing the learning transaction. When applied to a learning circumstance, Brockett and Hiemstra further suggest that 'it is the ability and/or willingness of individuals to take control of their own learning that determines their potential for self-direction' (p. 26). The authors directly link their definition of this component to Chene's (1983) definition of autonomy: 'Autonomy refers  to  one's  ability  to  choose  what  has  value,  that  is  to  say,  to  make  choices  in harmony with self-realization' (p. 39).

Findings  outside  the  field  of  adult  education  support  Brockett  and  Hiemstra's (1991) contention that personal control of the environment and choices about one's actions are related to constructs such as highly engaged learning (Csikszentmihalyi, 1988), self-managed learning (Pintrich, 2000), and self-regulated learning (Schunk &amp; Zimmerman, 2003). Perry, Hladkyj, Pekrun, and Pelletier (2001) reported that college students' levels of perceived control affected their academic performance, and this finding was supported and expanded in a later article (Perry, Hladkyj, Pekrun, Clifton, &amp; Chipperfield, 2005). In the later article, the authors suggest perceived academic control could even have the effect of transforming failure-preoccupation emotions to the positive consequences of better academic achievement. Reeve, Nix, and Hamm (2003) further refine the construct of perceived control when they discuss control and academic choices. They suggest that offering students choices from a teacher-generated list  does  not  affect  learner's  perceptions  of  self-determination, whereby facilitating 'choices over one's actions does engender an experience capable of affecting perceived self-determination' (p. 19).

Another important influence that Brockett and Hiemstra (1991) cite in the development of the TLT component is Knowles's (1975) development and definition of the process characteristics of self-directed learning. The definition of self-directed learning proposed by Knowles is very similar to Brockett and Hiemstra's:

A process in which individuals take the initiative, with or without the help of others, in diagnosing their learning needs, formulating learning goals, identifying

human and material resources for learning, choosing and implementing appropriate learning strategies and evaluating learning outcomes. (p. 18)

The major difference between the two definitions seems to center on Brockett and Hiemstra's term personal responsibility versus Knowles's term initiative . However, Brockett and Hiemstra also emphasize the proactive nature of personal responsibility, which seems to point to a behavior very similar to initiative. Finally, 14 adult education experts, through a three-round Delphi survey, identified initiative as one of the three necessary characteristics of self-directedness (L. M. Guglielmino, 1977).

Some literature outside the field of adult education tends to embed the action of initiative  within  portions  of  action  control  theory  (Kuhl,  1994),  implementation intention in planning (Gollwitzer &amp; Brandstatter, 1997), help seeking self-regulation (Karabenick, 2004), and academic volitional strategies (Diefendorff &amp; Lord, 2003). Senecal,  Koestner,  and  Vallerand  (1995),  building  on  the  work  of  Deci  and  Ryan (1991), suggest that a hallmark of nonautonomous regulatory behavior is the lack of task initiative. Senecal, Koestner, and Vallerand (1995) also present data noting a definite relationship between procrastination (sometimes viewed as the opposite of initiative) and a lack of genuine interest in the activity.

Therefore, scale items for the portion of Brockett and Hiemstra's (1991) model termed the TLT component will reflect agreement with actions that demonstrate proactively assuming control and initiative for planning, implementing, and evaluating the learning process. Items that relate to exhibiting control of the learning situation (e.g., Item 23: 'I always effectively organize my study time') compose one factor, and items that relate to demonstrating initiative (e.g., Item 10: 'I often use materials I've found on my own to help me in a course') compose a second factor.

## A Learner Characteristic (LC)

Brockett  and  Hiemstra  (1991)  offer  the  following  definition  of  the  learner  selfdirection component of their model: 'An individual's beliefs and attitudes that predispose one toward taking primary responsibility for their learning' (p. 29), and 'a learner's desire or preference for assuming responsibility for learning' (p. 24). This connection between personal preferences and learning has led many adult education scholars  to  postulate  a  theoretical  relationship  between  self-directed  learning  and intrinsic motivation. Two quantitative research studies (Bitterman, 1989; Delahaye &amp; Smith,  1995)  that  supported  this  relationship  were  located.  However,  literature appearing in psychology publications, specifically literature drawing from writings on self-determination theory and motivation, may further illuminate this relationship.

In an article exploring the meaning of self in self-direction, Deci and Ryan (2000) suggest that findings from recent motivational research 'guided by self-determination theory' may be a more 'psychologically meaningful way of defining self-directed learning for purposes of predicting academic achievement, class work adjustment,

and well-being' (p. 75). These authors formulate a basis for discussing learner selfdirection  that  requires  conceptualizing  motivation  orientations  as  self-determined/ self-controlled or other determined/other controlled. Deci and Ryan suggest that selfdirection in learning takes place when the motivation for learning is intrinsic or extrinsically motivated but freely chosen. In a later article, Vansteenkiste, Lens, and Deci (2006) discuss the type or quality of academic motivation as it relates to autonomy, noting that 'autonomous motivation involves the experience of volition and choice, whereas controlled motivation involves the experience of being pressure or coerced' (p. 19). According to self-determination theory, two types or qualities of motivation are not autonomous and do not support self-direction: external (behavior prompted by external contingencies such as rewards) and introjected (behavior prompted by internal pressures such as avoidance of guilt or self-aggrandizement). Two types of motivation do support self-direction: identification (behavior prompted by identification with the value of the activity, generally to meet a more distal goal) and intrinsic (behaviors prompted out of enjoyment and interest in the activity itself). A growing number of studies document the superiority of autonomous motivation with regard to learning (Reeve, Deci, &amp; Ryan, 2004).

A final theme common to the LC component of the PRO model of self-direction in learning (Brockett &amp; Hiemstra, 1991) and other writings on self-direction is the learner's self-confidence in self-directed activities. Early studies explored the relationship between self-confidence, self-esteem, and students' self-directed perceptions. McCune (1989), in her meta-analytic review of the relationship between self-directed learning and other variables, noted a significant mean effect size ( d = .230) in the 12  studies  that  investigated  the  relationship  with  self-confidence.  However,  Jones (1994) suggested that the construct self-confidence should be more precisely defined in adult education literature as self-efficacy based on Bandura's (1977) social-cognitive learning theories. Murphy and Alexander (2000) concurred, and in their review of motivational  constructs  and  academic  achievement,  they  cite  self-efficacy  as  the more useful and more clearly defined construct.

Self-efficacy as defined by Bandura (1997) refers to 'beliefs in one's capacities to organize and execute the courses of action required to produce given attainments' (p. 3). Reciprocal relationships exist between Bandura's triadic structure of personal beliefs, behaviors, and environmental processes. This model suggests that individuals with high self-efficacy  are  more  likely  to  positively  control  their  environment  and learning  outcomes.  Reviews  of  research  findings  (Bandura,  1997;  Pajares,  1996a, 2003) support the impact of self-efficacy on academic outcomes.

Pajares (1996b) reminds readers that items assessing self-efficacy beliefs need to be  specific  in  terms  of  domain  and  also  reflect  task  and  situational  demands.  One scale,  the  Self-Efficacy  for  Self-Directed  Learning  Questionnaire  (G.  J.  Hoban  &amp; Sersland, 2000), was located that linked item content relevant to Bandura's (1977) definition of self-efficacy with self-directed learning performance.

Therefore, using adult education literature and writings from psychology to supplement Brockett and Hiemstra's (1991) model, the LC component of their model was

conceptualized as behaviors relating to (a) learner autonomous motivation (e.g., Item 13: 'Most of the work I do in my courses is personally enjoyable or seems relevant to my reasons  for  attending  college')  and  (b)  perceived  self-efficacy  for  self-direction  in learning (e.g., Item 7: 'I am very confident in my ability to independently prioritize my learning goals').

## Method

## Study Design and Instrumentation

The purpose of this study was to develop a reliable and valid instrument to measure self-directedness in learning among college students based on an operationalization of the  process  and  LC  components  of  the  PRO  model  of  self-direction  in  learning (Brockett &amp; Hiemstra, 1991). For the proposed scale, a 5-point Likert-type format was chosen as the format that best reflected student's degree of agreement or disagreement with  statements  pertaining  to  self-perceptions  of  their  actions  and  beliefs  in  selfdirected learning opportunities. Items that were considered negative with respect to the  construct  were  reverse  scored.  Nunnally  and  Bernstein  (1994)  suggested  that including  reverse-scored  items  avoids  'confounding  the  measure  of  the  trait  with individual differences in willingness to say yes (acquiescence)' (p. 314).

Three author-designed questionnaires were used to (a) gather demographic information,  (b)  solicit  professor  ratings  of  students'  self-directedness,  and  (c)  survey expert opinion as to the appropriateness of the newly developed Personal Responsibility Orientation  to  Self-Direction  in  Learning  Scale  (PRO-SDLS).  Additionally,  one established  instrument  was  used  to  measure  self-direction:  L.  M.  Guglielmino's (1977) SDLRS. The SDLRS (L. M. Guglielmino, 1977) and the student-scored equivalent (P. J. Guglielmino &amp; Guglielmino, 1991) are the instruments of choice in the majority of research conducted to assess a learner's readiness for self-directed learning (Stockdale &amp; Brockett, 2000). Most reliability estimates are consistently reported as greater than .80. L. M. Guglielmino &amp; Associates (2002) further assert the scale has been used internationally with more than 40,000 adults and 'can be used with acceptable  confidence  to  provide  an  accurate  measurement  of  readiness  for  selfdirected learning' (para. 5). However, queries have been raised concerning methodological and validity issues (Bonham, 1991; Brockett, 1985; Field, 1989; J. D. Hoban et al., 2005).

A total of 518 college students, the vast majority drawn from an undergraduate educational psychology course in a large southeastern university, voluntarily participated in this study over a three-semester period. Convenience sampling was used to obtain the sample. All students were drawn from various sections of an undergraduate educational psychology course in human development and from a graduate course in adult learning. The undergraduate course is a requirement for teacher certification and, as such, students possess diverse academic interests, with enrollees including adult graduate students returning to school to obtain teacher certification.

The investigation comprised three research studies, the first two of which served as pilots for this main study and are reported elsewhere (Stockdale, 2003). In the third study, the 35 psychometrically sound items were retained and termed the Personal Responsibility Orientation to Self-Direction in Learning Scale-Initial (PRO-SDLS-i). These items were then examined by a research group familiar with the PRO model, and scale items that were clearly identifiable as representative of one of the hypothesized four factors were selected. Ten items that did not clearly represent one of the factors were dropped. A confirmatory factor analysis (Arbuckle, 1999) was performed with the final 25 items in the PRO-SDLS to determine if the model conformed to the data. Data from the final scale were then used to examine issues of reliability. To provide evidence of scale validity, students were asked to complete the SDLRS (L. M. Guglielmino, 1977) and the PRO-SDLS and provide other demographic and course performance data. In a selected subsample (graduate course enrollees), the professor, who is the second author of this article, was asked to independently rate a student's level of self-direction in learning based on the conceptualization of self-direction presented by Brockett and Hiemstra (1991).

The 1999 Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing state that validity is the 'degree to which evidence and theory support the interpretation of test scores entailed  by  the  proposed  uses'  (American  Educational  Research  Association, American  Psychological  Association,  &amp;  National  Council  on  Measurement  in Education, 1999, p. 9). Specific criteria validity was informed by examining the relationship between scores on self-directedness and logically related behavioral criteria, including age, gender, GPA, and educational attainment. Although little previous research identified a behavior representing self-directed learning, L. M. Guglielmino (1977) has presented some evidence for a relationship between age, gender, GPA, and educational attainment and self-direction as measured by the SDLRS. To explore the congruent validity of the measure of self-directedness, the relationship between scores from  the  PRO-SDLS and the instrument  of  choice  in  70%  of  the  research  studies (Stockdale &amp; Brockett, 2000) investigating self-direction, the SDLRS (L. M. Guglielmino, 1977) were examined. Convergent validity was evaluated by examining the relationship between PRO-SDLS scores and a professor's global rating of his students' selfdirection. Incremental validity statistics were also used to demonstrate that the new scale scores (PRO-SDLS) added significant unique variance to the prediction of selfdirection above and beyond scores from the traditional scale.

## Results

This section presents the results of the data analyses. Included are descriptions of the participants, reliability and descriptives for the established instrument (SDLRS; L.  M.  Guglielmino,  1977),  as  well  as  reliability  and  descriptives  for  the  initial 35-item  PRO-SDLS. Data for the final 25-item PRO-SDLS include descriptives, reliability, and validity results.

Note .  UNG = undergraduates only.

## Demographic Descriptive Statistics

The  'typical'  participant  in  this  final  study  was  a  23-year-old  female  (58%  were female; 31% male; 11% left query blank) who had completed 60 semester credit hours with a GPA near 3.00 (Table 1). Although ethnicity is of interest in the study of selfdirection, the homogeneous composition of students at this university did not permit this  analysis. For students in the undergraduate course ( n = 196),  the  typical  mean ACT score was around 23. For students enrolled in the graduate course ( n = 22), the professor independently rated the average student's level of self-directedness as a 5 on a scale of 1 to 10.

## Reliability and Descriptives of the Established Instrument (SDLRS)

Cronbach's alpha was used as an estimate of internal consistency for the SDLRS. The obtained coefficient α was .95. This estimate is consistent with reliability coefficients reported in recent studies employing the SDLRS (e.g., Cox, 2002) in college students. Examining scores at an item level located no items that produced an item-total correlation less than .20. However, four items (16, 19, 20, 48) produced correlations with the corrected total scores of less than .25. An additional three items (2, 29, 35) produced corrected item-total correlations between .25 and .29. It is also interesting to note that five of the seven items identified in this study as problematic because of low item-total correlations (19, 20, 29, 35, 48) are reverse scored. Descriptive statistics for the SDLRS, the PRO-SDLS-i, and the PRO-SDLS are presented in Table 2.

## Reliability and Descriptives for the PRO-SDLS-i

A total of 190 students completed the PRO-SDLS-i. The resulting coefficient α for these 35 items was .92, exceeding the commonly used criterion for reliability (Gay, Mills, &amp; Airasian, 2005). For the 19 items written to represent the TLT component, a

| SDLRS                  | 194 |       136 |       289 | 218.56 | 25.12 |

| Self-efficacy          | 199 |        13 |        30 |  22.09 |  3.48 |
| Motivation             | 197 |        10 |        30 |  20.17 |  4.16 |

coefficient α of .86 was obtained. All items correlated above .30 with the corrected component total, and the mean interitem correlation was .24. For the 16 items written to represent the LC component, a coefficient α of .88 emerged. Again, all items correlated with the corrected total component scores above .30, and the mean interitem correlation was .33. Complete descriptives are included in Table 2.

## Validity and Reliability of the New Instrument (PRO-SDLS; Final 25 Items)

From the 35 items, a panel of experts drawn from a research group of faculty and graduate  students  intimately  familiar  with  Brockett  and  Hiemstra's  (1991)  model selected 25 items from the above scale items as representative of one of the four factors.  At  least  three  of  the  four  experts  needed  to  place  the  same  item  in  the  same factor for the item to be included. A total of six items each were chosen as clearly representative of initiative, control, and self-efficacy. Seven items were selected as clearly  representative  of  autonomous  motivation.  All  25  items  produced  corrected item-total  correlations  greater  than  .31,  and  the  calculated  coefficient  α  for  the 25-item scale was .91. Internal consistency values were estimated for the following subcomponents:  initiative  (.81),  control  (.78),  motivation  (.82),  and  self-efficacy (.78). Total scale descriptives are also included in Table 2.

## Confirmatory Factor Analysis

According to expert judgment, the 25-item PRO-SDLS contained four factors, and confirmatory factor analysis using AMOS, Version 4.01 (a structural equation modeling  software  solution;  Arbuckle,  1999),  with  a  maximum-likelihood  method  of

estimation was conducted to test the model to data fit. The model suggests the PROSDLS is composed of four latent variables corresponding to the four subscales. Each of the 25 items will have a nonzero loading on one designated factor and zero loadings on the other factors, and the error measurements (variance not explained by the factor) are uncorrelated. Figure 2 presents the model of the PRO-SDLS factor structure. All the standardized regression weights calculated by the program are displayed next  to  the  scale  item  number  and  are  at  or  above  .40.  Additionally,  correlations among proposed factors were also calculated and are displayed.

Multiple fit indices were also explored: the chi-square, the chi-square/degrees of freedom ( df ) ratio, the comparison fit index (Bentler, 1990), the Tucker-Lewis index (Bentler &amp; Bonett, 1980), and the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA). The chi-squared method of data fit is often seen as unreliable for sample sizes larger

than 150 to 200 (McDonald, 1999), and McDonald suggests using the chi-square/ df ratio. The results, as well as preferred or acceptable model-fit ranges, are presented in Table 3. Although the model chi-square absolute value was significant, the other relative goodness-of-fit indices suggest the model had a good fit with the data.

## Validity

Congruent,  criterion,  convergent,  and  incremental  validities  are  evaluated.  These results are presented in the following sections.

Congruent  validity .  To  explore  the  congruent  validity  of  the  measure  of  selfdirectedness, the relationship between scores from the SDLRS (L. M. Guglielmino, 1977) and PRO-SDLS were examined. Table 4 demonstrates significant shared variances  for  the  relationships  between  the  SDLRS  scores  and  total,  component,  and factor scores of the PRO-SDLS.

Criterion  validity .  Criterion  validity  was  informed  by  examining  the  relationship between scores on self-directedness and logically related behavioral criteria, including age, GPA, ACT, and educational attainment. It should be noted that there were no significant differences in any of the scale scores based on gender.

As can be seen from the data in Table 5, the proportion of variance ( r 2 ) in the criterion variables accounted for by PRO-SDLS scores ranged from approximately 20% for GPA and completed semester hours to less than 3% for ACT scores. Examining the shared variance for various PRO-SDLS scores locates similar significant relationships between GPA and semester hours and total and component scores, and significant correlations and shared variance between age and scale totals and components with the exception of the correlation between age and the factor of control. ACT scores appear to correlate most significantly with scale factors related to initiative.

Convergent validity .  Convergent validity was evaluated by examining the relationship between scores on self-directedness rating scales and ratings by a professor of the self-directedness  of  his  students  ( n = 22).  There  was  no  significant  relationship between professor ratings and total or component scale scores. However, it is interesting to note the presence of a strong association ( r = .56; p &lt; .05; df = 19) between one factor, initiative, and professor ratings.

Incremental validity . Finally, statistics demonstrated that the new scale scores (PROSDLS) added significant unique variance to the prediction of self-direction above and beyond scores from the SDLRS. A series of hierarchical multiple regression analyses were conducted to investigate this objective. Criterion variables included age, GPA, and previously completed semester hours. The SDLRS (L. M. Guglielmino, 1977) scores served as a covariant for the second variable entered, PRO-SDLS scores. When this procedure was used to determine if PRO-SDLS scores improved on the prediction

of GPA, age, and course performance afforded by SDLRS scores, a significant change was demonstrated in the squared multiple correlations for GPA (squared semipartial r = .14; p &lt; .01) and course performance points (squared semipartial r = .03; p &lt; .05).

## Discussion

Based on the evidence presented from this initial study, it appears that the scale holds much promise in the study of self-directed learning within the higher education setting. In the following discussion, several issues will be discussed related to scale construction, practice, and implications for future research.

## Scale Construction Issues

Convergent validity generally refers to the ability of two independent methods of measuring a construct to produce similar results. In this study, PRO-SDLS scale scores were compared with a professor's rating of the respondent's level of self-direction. No significant association was established with total PRO-SDLS scores. However, even with the small sample size, the factor initiative was highly correlated with professor ratings. Findings from three studies (Barnes &amp; Morris, 2000; Long &amp; Agyekum, 1983, 1984) that evaluated the relationship between L. M. Guglielmino's (1977) SDLRS and professor ratings failed to note any significant relationships. However, Crook (1985) found that peers were able to predict (in limited situations) self-directedness. Perhaps peers possess knowledge that is more intimate as to the self-directed activities of their classmates.

Criterion-related validity is evaluated by comparing the test score with external variables thought to provide a direct measure of the characteristic or behavior. The results of other studies that attempted to establish a degree of criterion-related validity between self-report instruments and other direct measures have also been disappointing. For example, West and Bentley (1991) surveyed more than 800 teachers as to their participation in continuing education opportunities. The teachers also completed both the SDLRS and the Oddi Continuing Learning Inventory (Oddi, 1986). The  overall  results  suggest  that  neither  instrument  was  helpful  in  explaining participation.

Lacking a clear criterion-related variable that provides a direct measure of selfdirection, most scale authors rely on the relationship between age, GPA, educational attainment and a student's self-reported level of self-direction. The results from this analysis suggest that the PRO-SDLS scores added unique variance to the prediction of GPA. It is not necessary to assume that there is a causal relationship between GPA and self-direction. For purposes relevant to this discussion, it may be enough to note the correlational relationship: An increase in a student's PRO-SDLS score is generally linked to an increase in his or her academic performance. Logically, fostering selfdirection based on an operationalization of Brockett and Hiemstra's (1991) model facilitates adult learning and successful college achievement.

## Implications for Practice

Hiemstra (1994) noted that traditional teaching and learning situations do not foster self-direction. Instead, these approaches emphasize that 'control over content or process remains in the hands of experts  designers, or teachers who depend primarily on , didactic  or  teacher-directed  approaches'  (pp.  81-82).  To  rectify  this  approach, Hiemstra proposed a series of microcomponents for teachers over which students may assume control. Deci and Ryan (2000) suggested that students' motivational orientation  was  influenced  by  factors  in  the  environment  (e.g.,  teachers)  that  affect  their self-perceptions of competence and autonomy. Teachers who allow students to make decisions about their learning and provide clear feedback about the students' progress support students' perceptions of their autonomy and competence.

Noels, Clement, and Pelletier (1999) investigated how students' perceptions of their teacher's support for their autonomy and the provision of useful feedback were related to motivational orientation in adult students learning a second language. These authors suggested that intrinsic motivation is associated with the teacher's communicative style. Language that was perceived as controlling or nonconstructive was associated with lessened self-determined motivations. The authors contend that providing constructive information is 'necessary to develop the learner's competence, while at the same time encouraging the student to regulate his or her own learning behavior' (p. 31).

Often, instructors confuse praise for constructive information or encouragement. The specific operationalized components of praise, according to Kelly and Daniels (1997), involve (a) the approval, evaluation, or expectations of the person giving the praise; (b) the use of superlative; (c) overt or implied comparisons with the performance of others; and (d) focus on the goal of performance outcome over effort. On the other  hand,  encouragement is operationalized as (a) descriptive rather than judgmental,  (b)  highlighting  the  social  usefulness  or  functional  value  of  the  behavior, (c) emphasizing progress and improvement compared with one's prior performance, (d) emphasizing effort/persistence over outcome, and (e) focusing on the pride/good feelings the person may have about self as a result of a positive performance. Kelly and Daniels contend that encouragement fosters a person's self-acceptance of their basic worth, stimulates self-evaluation, and encourages responsibility for their behavior. Both Kelly and Daniels (1997) and Stapleton-Vitale (1984) infer that adults may more readily identify praise as controlling or manipulative.

## Implications for Future Research

In the original conceptualization of the PRO-SDLS, the authors struggled with the question of whether the instrument should be a 'general' scale, designed to measure self-directedness of adults in general or whether it should focus on a particular audience. After much discussion and consultation with an expert in psychometrics, it was decided that the scale should be limited to a particular segment of learners: those who are participating in a higher education course.

Although the PRO-SDLS appears to have sound psychometric properties when used with its target audience, the question remains about how to measure self-directedness in other settings, such as the workplace, community and social service agencies, adult basic education, and so forth. For many years, the second author of this article has advocated the development of a general scale. However, over time, given the difficulties of making a general instrument relevant to diverse sociocultural contexts, we have come to believe that an important direction for future research is the need to continue developing instruments designed for specific settings. The conceptualization of the PRO-SDLS could serve as an underlying framework for such instruments; however, the language and focus of each instrument would be aimed at a different target audience.  The  knowledge  base  of  self-directed  learning  has  mushroomed  since  the 1970s, when the first efforts to measure self-directedness were undertaken, to the point where it makes sense to think in terms of multiple measures of self-directed learning that  address  different  aspects  or  conceptualizations  of  the  construct  or  are  targeted toward different audiences.

Finally, although the evidence presented in this initial study on the development of the PRO-SDLS offers evidence to support the use of this scale as a reliable and valid measure of self-directedness, there is a clear need for further research using the scale to determine the extent to which the psychometric properties reported in this article hold up under further examination. To date, limited studies have used the PRO-SDLS (e.g., Fogerson, 2005). Yet, based on the evidence to date, we are optimistic that the PRO-SDLS holds much promise to add to the scales already available.
