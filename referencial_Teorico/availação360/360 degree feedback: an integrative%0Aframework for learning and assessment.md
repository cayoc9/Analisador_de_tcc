Feedback is widely acknowledged as the crux of a learning process. Multiplicities of research studies have been advanced to address the commoncri de coeur of teachers and students for a constructive and effective feedback mechanism in the current higher educational settings. Nevertheless, existing pedagogical approaches in feedback are fragmented and ad hoc in nature. Taken in isolation, each approach fails to capture the full role and complexity of assessment feedback in the learning process. The paper provides a synthesis of existing practices in the field of assessment feedback and identifies the core guiding elements to develop a holistic and integrated feedback system. The 360 degree (360 ) feedback system is proposed and its systematic implementation is demonstrated via the interplay between self-, peer and teacher assessment. It is concluded that the elements of 360  system when combined and integrated help to maximise the functions of feedback to enhance learning.

1. Introduction

Assessment feedback is critical scaffolding in the development of quality teaching and effective learning in all educational settings (Black and William[1998](#_page11_x0.00_y702.99); Carless et al.[2011](#_page11_x0.00_y702.99); Feys, Anseel, and Wille [2011](#_page12_x0.00_y702.99); Price, Handley, and Millar [2011](#_page13_x0.00_y702.99)). Yet it remains the least satisfactory constituent in the teaching and learning experience as evidenced by several national surveys on student and course experience, such as the UK National Student Survey (HEFCE [2011](#_page12_x0.00_y702.99)) and Australian Course Experience Questionnaire. The surveys reveal a number of factors underlying the dissatisfaction. Students are often dissatisfied with the value and effectiveness of assessment feedback they receive, in terms of specificity and opportunity for improvement, difficulty in comprehension and discour- aging impact on students  self-perception and confidence (Carless [2006](#_page11_x0.00_y702.99)). Additionally, teachers view it as an enormous drain on their time and effort to craft useful feedback in a timely manner. This is especially so when students do not read and reflect upon it. The frustration of teachers intensifies when workload increases as student numbers increase and class sizes become larger (Nicol and Macfarlane-Dick[2006](#_page13_x0.00_y702.99)). Furthermore, strategies, debates and policies have been criticised for concentrating on assessment feedback as an end product rather than a means in enhancing learning experience. Despite the emergence![](Aspose.Words.e51d4007-2aaa-49dc-b3d7-c8bb21874f8a.006.png)

of student-centred learning as the significant pedagogy in contemporary educational settings, a parallel shift to student-centred formative assessment and feedback has been slower to emerge (Nicol and Macfarlane-Dick [2006](#_page13_x0.00_y702.99)). Assessment feedback is still generally perceived as a process of information transmission dominated mainly by teachers (Nicol and Macfarlane-Dick[2006](#_page13_x0.00_y702.99)). The top-down and one-way transmission of feedback is perceived as barrier for student-centred learning as it ignores the way feedback interacts with motivation and beliefs.

Although an increasingly varied range of pedagogical approaches have been devised to improve the current practices in assessment feedback, Fraser et al. [(1987](#_page12_x0.00_y702.99), 149) criticise that much educational research focuses on the relation between a single cause and its effect . This disregards the fact that education embraces diverse means and ends, each with an explicit or implicit cost or value (Fraser et al.[1987](#_page12_x0.00_y702.99)), and ad hoc and fragmented initiatives can only have a marginal effect on learning. This has led to a call for holistic pedagogic interventions across a range of contexts (Yorke [2003](#_page13_x0.00_y702.99)). In this paper, we propose a feedback system in a holistic manner as a mechanism of overcoming ad hoc and piecemeal approaches to feedback. Specifically, we extend existing research on assessment feedback by addressing two aims:

1) Identify the elements underpinning the holistic feedback system to enhance students  learning.
1) Demonstrate a holistic feedback system that showcases the interplay between self-, peer and teacher assessment.
2. A holistic approach to assessment feedback: the 360 degree feedback system

The era of assessment in higher education is in transition from assessment of learning (aka summative assessment)  to assessment for learning (aka formative assessment) . The era of assessment of learning  can be characterised by the dominance of teacher-led assessment and by measuring learning outcomes, solely at the end of a learning process in the form of a single total score (Dochy, Segers, and Sluijsmans [1999](#_page12_x0.00_y702.99); Fallows and Chandramohan [2001](#_page12_x0.00_y702.99); Gielen et al.[2011](#_page12_x0.00_y702.99)). It has been perceived as an authoritarian system involving unilateral intellectual authority by teachers and disengaging students in every stage of learning (Falchikov [1986](#_page12_x0.00_y702.99)).

Following the evolution in assessment practices, the emerging trend of assessment for learning  emphasises a pluralist approach in learning. This approach promotes integration of assessment and feedback and engages student as an active learner who assumes responsibility, reflects, collaborates and communicates dialogically and continu- ingly with teacher (Dochy, Segers, and Sluijsmans[1999](#_page12_x0.00_y702.99)). In parallel with the fundamental changes in the goals of assessment, the approaches to assessment need to be in harmony. Sadler ([1989](#_page13_x0.00_y702.99)) warns that many principles appropriate to assessment of learning  are tangential to assessment for learning . The need to diversify mainstream forms of assessment feedback has long been recognised as a tenable claim, but the direction and forms of emerging assessment practices have been slow in crystallisation (Hatzipanagos and Rochon [2010](#_page12_x0.00_y702.99); Sadler [1989](#_page13_x0.00_y702.99), [1998](#_page13_x0.00_y702.99)).

In line with the pluralist approach (Dochy, Segers, and Sluijsmans [1999](#_page12_x0.00_y702.99)), an integrated mechanism is required to manage the complexity of assessment demands. Increasingly, attention is being given to the value of feedback and assessment for learning  as a means of dealing with this complexity (Cartney[2010](#_page11_x0.00_y702.99)). A wide body of

research identifies self-assessment (Fazey[1993](#_page12_x0.00_y702.99); Sadler [1989](#_page13_x0.00_y702.99)) and peer assessment (Boud, Cohen, and Sampson [1999](#_page11_x0.00_y702.99); Brutus and Donia [2010](#_page11_x0.00_y702.99); Cartney [2010](#_page11_x0.00_y702.99); Fry [1990](#_page12_x0.00_y702.99); Gielen et al. [2011](#_page12_x0.00_y702.99)) in addition to teacher assessment as ways to enhance the experience of teaching and learning. Unfortunately, there remains at present considerable incoherence in the implementation of these initiatives as well as continued emphasis on assessment of learning . Research continues to focus on aspects of marking or grading (Boud[1989](#_page11_x0.00_y702.99); Falchikov [1986](#_page12_x0.00_y702.99)), developing relevant skills and criteria in marking and evaluation (Fazey [1993](#_page12_x0.00_y702.99); Orsmond, Merry, and Reiling [2002](#_page13_x0.00_y702.99); Sadler [1989](#_page13_x0.00_y702.99)) and investigating students attitudes towards non-traditional feedback approaches of self- and peer assessments (Fry [1990](#_page12_x0.00_y702.99)).

Additionally, most extant research tackles self-, peer and teacher assessments sepa- rately and neglects the potential effect these can generate when used in combination. There remains a significant gap in research on how to integrate multiple approaches to create coherent and integrated feedback for enhanced learning. This provides the underlying rationale for this paper s aim to develop an integrated framework towards a holistic feedback system. The concept of 360 degree (360 ) feedback in human resource management (HRM) as an effective multi-directional assessment inventory of employees performance (Nowack [1993](#_page13_x0.00_y702.99)) prompted us to the development of the system in educational context. In HRM, performance feedback on employees is sought from colleagues, superiors, subordinates and customers. It is believed to be a highly effective performance evaluation tool, commonly used in organisations (Mabey[2001](#_page13_x0.00_y702.99); Nowack [1993](#_page13_x0.00_y702.99)). Consistent with the multi-rater approach in HRM, feedback in learning is sought from peers and teachers. The system is organised around the core elements identified by integrating self-, peer and teacher assessments.

3. Core elements of the 360  feedback system

The limitations of feedback are well rehearsed in the literature (Black and William[1998](#_page11_x0.00_y702.99); Dochy, Segers, and Sluijsmans [1999](#_page12_x0.00_y702.99); Gibbs and Simpson [2004](#_page12_x0.00_y702.99); Nicol and Macfarlane- Dick [2006](#_page13_x0.00_y702.99); Yorke [2003](#_page13_x0.00_y702.99)). Most of the literature concentrates on the issues associated with effectiveness and efficiency of the feedback process and methods. As highlighted earlier, timeliness and frequency of feedback, clarity of feedback contents, and relevance of feedback in learning are the common problems with current higher educational settings. The widespread frustration and dissatisfaction with feedback process and methods necessitates the need for improvement.

A good feedback system is not a single discrete activity but encompassed by a bundle of elements and practices. Moreover, attempts to tinker with feedback elements independently in a piecemeal manner are likely to be insufficient. We review the best practices as the starting point to chart a way forward in enhancing feedback effectiveness. Drawing together the relatively diverse research findings on assessment feedback, we identify six primary elements that support teaching and learning and incorporate these in the 360  feedback system ([Figure 1](#_page4_x0.00_y702.99)). The six elements are timing, quality, quantity, social pressure, reflection and communication. These elements are neither mutually exclusive nor independent. An effective system enables these elements to function intertwiningly to maximise the potential of feedback for learning. The following discussion explains how these elements work to produce the desired set of outcomes.

Figure 1. Core elements of 360  feedback system.

1. Timing

The element of time in feedback process concerns the characteristics of prompt and regular feedback on learning. Good teaching practice emphasises prompt feedback (Chickering and Gamson[1987](#_page12_x0.00_y702.99); Freeman and Lewis[1998](#_page12_x0.00_y702.99)). The greater the delay, the less likely students will find it useful or incline to act on it. For feedback to be timely and effective, it is imperative for students to start the process early, which then allows teachers sufficient time to provide feedback. In turn, this allows students sufficient time to act upon the feedback received. However, in practice, most students are inclined to commence their work only when pressed by fast approaching deadlines, let alone seek feedback for better learning outcomes. The possible repercussion of such a proclivity is that students tend to emphasise a product approach in learning rather than on the process of achieving learning gains (Beaumont, O Doherty, and Shannon [2011](#_page11_x0.00_y702.99); Carless [2002](#_page11_x0.00_y702.99)). From the perspective of this study, the time-dependent nature of feedback activities requires reconceptualising feedback from post hoc feedback into prompt and regular dialogue about learning that enhances the performance quality (Beaumont, O Doherty, and Shannon [2011](#_page11_x0.00_y702.99)).

2. Quality

Considerable research in the area of assessment feedback is on the quality of feedback content (Feys, Anseel, and Wille [2011](#_page12_x0.00_y702.99); Sadler [1998](#_page13_x0.00_y702.99)). Whilst high quality of feedback content remains the uncontestedraison d Œtreof assessment for learning , we emphasise the quality of feedback process that engages all stakeholders particularly students in teaching and learning. Learning is achieved through quality of student engagement in learning tasks, not teachers doing lots of marking or students spending hours reproducing what they have memorised (Gibbs and Simpson[2004](#_page12_x0.00_y702.99)).

The term engagement  is not universally agreed upon in definition. There is however a general consensus that student engagement is a process rather than a product <a name="_page4_x0.00_y702.99"></a>(McFadden and Munns [2002](#_page13_x0.00_y702.99), 362). Most researchers take the position that, pedagogical

tactics and strategies that actively engage students in learning activities yield greatest gains in educational and personal growth (Bryson and Hand[2007](#_page11_x0.00_y702.99)).

Drawing on the socially embedded conceptualisation of engagement reveals that engagement is influenced by individual and contextual factors, such as relationships between students, peers and teachers (Bryson and Hand[2007](#_page11_x0.00_y702.99); Price, Handley, and Millar [2011](#_page13_x0.00_y702.99)). It is generally acknowledged that influence of class hours on educational quality is minimal, what matters more in getting learning gains is the close contact  between teachers and students in and out of classes (Gibbs [2010](#_page12_x0.00_y702.99)). Students demonstrate strong intellectual commitment when frequent contact with teachers helps to motivate and engage them to think about the learning values (Chickering and Gamson[1987](#_page12_x0.00_y702.99)). Similarly, working with peers in a collaborative and collegiate manner enhances engagement in learning (Chickering and Gamson [1987](#_page12_x0.00_y702.99)).

Engagement can also be enhanced using strategies such as allowing refinement of work following feedback or using peer review for feedback prior to finalisation of work (Price, Handley, and Millar [2011](#_page13_x0.00_y702.99)).

3. Quantity

Resource constraints facing higher learning institutions have led to a decline in the frequency of assignments and in the quantity and quality of feedback (Gibbs and Simpson [2004](#_page12_x0.00_y702.99)). However, as class sizes have increased due to mass education, teachers remain under enormous time pressure and workload to provide written feedback. Pessimistically, under such a predicament, the choice is either to maintain quality  or increase quantity . It is either quality  gives way to quantity  or quantity  makes way for quality . We take the view that whilst both quality and quantity of feedback have overwhelming influence on learning, quantity should not increase the already heavy workload of teachers in marking.

Significant feedback is useful in supporting learning if it is provided often enough and on a relatively small chunk of course content rather than one piece of detailed feedback after the end of a course (Gibbs and Simpson[2004](#_page12_x0.00_y702.99)). Students should receive feedback in regular intervals to enhance the quality of their work. The final work with higher quality ultimately eases the workload of teachers in providing lengthy and sometimes unpleasant written feedback at the end of the assessment.

4. Social pressure

Past research reveals that social pressure from a group exerts strong influence on individual member s behaviour (Gibbs and Simpson [2004](#_page12_x0.00_y702.99); Johnson and Johnson [2009](#_page12_x0.00_y702.99)). However, scant investigation has been directed towards understanding the possible role of social pressure in complex cognitive processes such as learning (Allen and Bragg[1968](#_page11_x0.00_y702.99)).

Drawing upon social interdependence theory, it is contended that positive social interdependence binds group members together and results in feelings of responsibility in (1) completing one s share of work and (2) facilitating the work of other group members in order to uphold the individuals and group s welfare (Johnson and Johnson [2009](#_page12_x0.00_y702.99)). Responsibility forces are strengthened when there is group and individual accountability (Johnson and Johnson [2009](#_page12_x0.00_y702.99)).

Although most research emphasises the effect of social pressure derived from the conformity of group norms and beliefs (Allen and Bragg[1968](#_page11_x0.00_y702.99)), it is formulated as social interdependence to promote the achievement of mutual goals of the group and individual in this study. Specifically, the primary responsibility of a group is to provide support, encouragement, and assistance to make academic progress and develop cognitively and socially in healthy ways as well as holding each other accountable for striving to learn (Johnson and Johnson [2009](#_page12_x0.00_y702.99), 374). Research suggests that cooperative learning methods are generally superior to competitive and individualistic methods in student achievement (Crooks [1988](#_page12_x0.00_y702.99)) although some researchers disagree with the conclusion (Cotton and Cook [1982](#_page12_x0.00_y702.99)). One key factor for social pressure to work constructively is the composition and social cohesion of group members. Norms developed in a peer group, as well as group size, have an influential role in social cohesion. Small group with shared norms tends to demonstrate stronger social cohesion and higher level of engagement (Ahlfeldt, Mehta, and Sellnow [2005](#_page11_x0.00_y702.99)).

Student sense of responsibility to others and their cooperation in learning derived from social pressure helps to change the way students learn (Gibbs[1999](#_page12_x0.00_y702.99)). We view social pressure at its optimum level as a constructive driver of student engagement within the teaching and learning process.

5. Reflection

One of the main functions of feedback is to promote meta-cognition by encouraging students  reflection and awareness of learning processes involved in the assignment (Gibbs and Simpson [2004](#_page12_x0.00_y702.99), 20). Self-assessment is perceived as an effective way that encourages reflection on the learning process and allows students better control over their learning strategies (Dochy, Segers, and Sluijsmans [1999](#_page12_x0.00_y702.99); Nicol and Macfarlane-Dick [2006](#_page13_x0.00_y702.99)). All self-assessments involve reflection, although not all reflections lead to self- assessment. Despite the fact that self-assessment by students is rare, delegation of assessment responsibility to students is asine qua non for effective learning (Black and William [1998](#_page11_x0.00_y702.99)).

In order to facilitate opportunity for reflection, it is logically important to engage students in identifying performance standards or criteria related to their work and benchmarking their work to these standards (Nicol and Macfarlance-Dick [2006](#_page13_x0.00_y702.99)). Furthermore, peer assessment should be incorporated to support the development of self-reflection skills as it provides opportunity to make objective judgements against standards and engage in evaluation of works other than their own (Dochy, Segers, and Sluijsmans [1999](#_page12_x0.00_y702.99); Nicol and Macfarlance-Dick [2006](#_page13_x0.00_y702.99); Sadler [1983](#_page13_x0.00_y702.99)). The introduction of peer assessment helps students to gain better understanding of the criteria upon which their work is evaluated (Higgins, Hartley, and Skelton[2002](#_page12_x0.00_y702.99)). In addition, self-assessment in relation to exemplars such as the work produced by peers enriches the profundity of reflection. If self-reflection has any validity, students are able to make sound evaluation of works of the same genre they themselves are trying to produce (Sadler [1983](#_page13_x0.00_y702.99)). Self-assessment and peer assessment are juxtaposition of engagement in self-reflection.

6. Communication

Feedback is by no means a unidirectional transmission of knowledge (Price, Handley, and Millar [2011](#_page13_x0.00_y702.99); Sadler [1998](#_page13_x0.00_y702.99)). Rather, it is a communication process (Higgins, Hartley, and Skelton [2001](#_page12_x0.00_y702.99)) in a broad sense that involves transmission of information between the senders and recipients. The encoding of feedback comments by senders and the decoding

8  D.D. Tee and P.K. Ahmed

of feedback by recipients are influenced by the interaction of both parties as well as the environment and context of feedback, where there is likely to be a certain amount of  noise  that will distort the intended meaning of the message (Higgins, Hartley, and Skelton [2001](#_page12_x0.00_y702.99); Price, Handley, and Millar[2011](#_page13_x0.00_y702.99)). The fundamental problem in assessment feedback is the failure to recognise the complexity of assessment feedback as a unique form of communication (Higgins, Hartley, and Skelton[2001](#_page12_x0.00_y702.99)). The conventional model of communication in the context of higher education takes the form of linear transfer of information from a sender (teacher) of message to a recipient (student) via a medium (Higgins, Hartley, and Skelton[2001](#_page12_x0.00_y702.99)). The conventional mode of communication does not only entail the problem of unilateral and top-down mode of communication but also implies the problem of power relationship between both parties. Moreover, students who are in the receiving end of feedback do not have opportunity to participate actively in feedback process.

Our position reinforces the need to move away from the conventional model of feedback communication, in favour of dialogical, interactive and regular exchanges of information in which students and teachers are jointly involved (Carless et al.[2011](#_page11_x0.00_y702.99)).

4. Implementation of the 360  feedback system

Our orientation towards the idea of 360  feedback system is rooted in the strong confidence expressed by extant literature on the shift towards a multi-faceted formative assessment approach (Boud[1990](#_page11_x0.00_y702.99); Falchikov [1986](#_page12_x0.00_y702.99); Jenkins [2010](#_page12_x0.00_y702.99)). The system as a whole adds value, beyond that of independent methods, primarily by emphasising the coherent relationship among the interrelated methods. In essence, the system constitutes a set of interconnected assessment methods, i.e. self-, peer and teacher assessments functioning together under the guidance of positive feedback elements with a common objective to enhance students  learning.

We devised and implemented 360  feedback system within a taught unit in manage- ment discipline at undergraduate course level. We focused on the assignment component in its implementation, as research evidence informed that higher quality of learning occurs in the assignment component (Gibbs and Simpson [2004](#_page12_x0.00_y702.99)). The implementation process composes of three main stages in its operation namely pre-task guidance, in-task guidance and post-task guidance.

First, in the stage of pre-task guidance, introductory briefing about the purpose and operation of 360  feedback system was conducted at the start of the semester. Following from the preliminaries, the system commenced its process by allocating weekly tutorials to various aspects of assignment preparation. This was intended to capture students  time and effort in learning by distributing the assignment preparation across the course. At the preparatory stage, students conducted preliminary research on relevant literature and organised them into a coherent way before presenting it to class in the form of poster presentation. Poster presentations were scheduled at least 2 weeks before the deadline of assignment submission and hence enabled students to receive feedback and refine their work before full submission of the written assignments.

Next, during the stage of in-task guidance, feedback on each of the poster was sought from students, peers and the teacher. Self- and peer evaluations took the form of formative assessment. Teacher evaluation took the form of formative and summative assessments. The integration of cooperative assessment with formative and summative was to facilitate students  active engagement in assessing themselves and their peers whilst allowing teacher to maintain the necessary control over the final assessment (Dochy, Segers, and Sluijsmans [1999](#_page12_x0.00_y702.99)). Based on the feedback received, students revised their work for final submission.

Finally, in the stage of post-task guidance, the graded reports were returned to students with grades and feedback provided by teacher.

4\.1. Implementation factors

We distill out the learning points arising from this exercise as key factors for successful implementation in terms of instituting a systematic feedback process, encouraging active student engagement, providing staged feedback, and planning and monitoring group progress and dynamic in learning.

1. Institute a systematic process approach

In order to capture the time-dependent nature of feedback, the 360  feedback system is designed to schedule its feedback process into three highly systematic and sequential stages. This requires an intervention task that initiates the feedback process. An effective feedback intervention is critical to maximally increase engagement from all parties.

Interventions can be varied. From among the many, we suggest the use of poster presentation as an easy yet comprehensive means for providing meaningful formative feedback (Orsmond, Merry, and Reiling [2002](#_page13_x0.00_y702.99)). Preparatory guidance needs to be scheduled well ahead of the full submission deadline. This will encourage students to start preparation work early. At the in-task guidance stage, students begin to participate in 360  feedback system by requiring them to solicit face-to-face feedback from multi- sources (teacher, peer and self-reflection).

Based on the initial feedback to the intervention, students are required to improve on their drafts. During this in-task guidance stage, progress and remedial feedback via face-to-face consultation with teacher and peers can be gained. This aids the process of self-reflection. In the wrap-up stage, written submission is graded and feedback on the overall performance is provided in written format by teacher. In order to engage a student to act upon the post-submission feedback, it is important for the feedback to be forward- looking which connects the relevance of the current experience with the subsequent learning activities the student will engage with.

2. Encourage active student  agency

The 360  feedback system embraces quality engagement via student  faculty contact ,  cooperation among students  and active learning . This mechanism enables frequent student  faculty contact, which is an important factor in student motivation and involvement (Chickering and Gamson[1987](#_page12_x0.00_y702.99)). In this system, individual and his/her peers are required to take an active role, whereas teacher acts as one of the team members. This also helps downplay the power relationship between teachers and students as perceived generally. Staff and student interaction helps students in building their intellectual commitment and keep on working.

Good learning is collaborative and social, not competitive and isolated (Chickering and Gamson [1987](#_page12_x0.00_y702.99)). Peer evaluation and teamwork employed in the 360  feedback system

10  D.D. Tee and P.K. Ahmed

encourages cooperation among students. Sharing of ideas with peers and responding to peers  comments and queries helps to improve one s thinking and deepen understanding.

To work the feedback system requires students to be proactive in their learning. They should not just listen passively to teachers but must be encouraged to question their own understanding. Quality engagement is facilitated when students feel safe and approach the learning activity with joy and creativity.

3. Provide staged or distributed feedback

Learning without regular feedback is unlikely to orient students  effort in constructive ways in their quest for knowledge. The 360  feedback system must be organised to ensure distributed student effort across the course by dividing the feedback process into three highly systematic and sequential stages. This way, students are constantly guided by feedback to help them work through misconceptions or other weaknesses in performance (Crooks [1988](#_page12_x0.00_y702.99); Freeman and Lewis [1998](#_page12_x0.00_y702.99); Gibbs [1999](#_page12_x0.00_y702.99)). Furthermore, opportunities to provide feedback at multiple stages during an on-going assessment help to reorient students  motivation and effort in appropriate way (Carless[2002](#_page11_x0.00_y702.99); Gibbs and Simpson [2004](#_page12_x0.00_y702.99)). Specifically, students learn through feedback in a progressive manner towards further development of long-term learning (Higgins, Hartley, and Skelton[2002](#_page12_x0.00_y702.99)). This distributed process also enables teacher to monitor students  progress and to provide them feedback which can be used to improve the quality of full submission. In essence, the 360  feedback system increases the amount of total feedback through careful planning of the frequency and quantity with which students are engaged in feedback process.

4. Plan and monitor the group progress and group dynamics in learning

The effect of social pressure on behaviours varies along different stages of learning. The effects are more pronounced when the task is ambiguous or when an individual has low self-confidence to attempt the task (Allen and Bragg[1968](#_page11_x0.00_y702.99)). The 360  feedback system by way of cooperative assessment and learning through group work provides the opportunity to minimise ambiguity and rekindle students  confidence during the knowledge acquisition phase of learning.

For the 360  feedback system to function effectively, students should identify and form peer groups. The reason for this lies in the belief that group norms over time enhance group cohesiveness and ultimately lead to cooperative learning. Additionally, group size needs to be deliberately kept small. The benefits of cooperative structure are greater when group sizes are small and when the task requires more interdependence among group members and the task is not a simple one (Crooks[1988](#_page12_x0.00_y702.99)).

Collaborative self- and peer assessment in the 360  feedback system benefits from social pressure in several ways. First, peers tend to have better knowledge and understanding than teachers on issues and difficulties facing their peers (Dochy, Segers, and Sluijsmans [1999](#_page12_x0.00_y702.99)). Thus, peer assessment in the 360  feedback system utilises the influence of relatively equal peers to encourage true cooperation and sharing to take place in the learning process (Wentzel[1994](#_page13_x0.00_y702.99)). In addition, cooperative structures in the feedback system encourage helping and within-group tutoring behaviours (Crooks [1988](#_page12_x0.00_y702.99)). This structure facilitates discussion, information exchange and idea generation in the peer group. Furthermore, peers have more opportunity to observe and monitor the progress of others in the group. Social pressure helps to alleviate problem of social loafing and procrastination.

Group members are typically under the pressure to perform on a par with others or to some extent outperform others in the group. The 360  feedback system with an intervention provides students an opportunity to observe their peers  performance and to solicit feedback and suggestions from others and self-reflection. It is an influential pressure that keeps peers motivated to learn.

Additionally, the 360  feedback system serves as a platform for nurturing positive social bonding within a group. Social bonding established in a team can alleviate negative peer pressure, thereby allowing students to be relaxed in offering and accepting criticism constructively (Orsmond, Merry, and Reiling[2002](#_page13_x0.00_y702.99)). Thus, the ties among participants are an important platform for knowledge sharing. Moreover, learning in a cooperative group is more enjoyable than learning individually, and tends to enhance intrinsic motivation for learning (Crooks [1988](#_page12_x0.00_y702.99)).

5. Adopt facilitation perspective

Cooperative assessment, particularly self- and peer assessments incorporated in 360 feedback system shifts the role of teachers from teaching to facilitating active learning and the importance of passing on the responsibility of learning from teachers to students (Orsmond, Merry, and Reiling[2002](#_page13_x0.00_y702.99)). It encourages students to reflect on the assessment process as part of their own learning. Self- and peer assessments are novel experience to students, and therefore a mechanism of checks and balances  is needed to orient students to a position of stronger self-reflection for learning. The mechanism for this purpose is the teacher assessment, and is a critical supplement to confirm and/or remedy feedback and comments received by students or other sources.

In this manner, the 360  feedback system enables students to reflect on the assessment process as part of their learning. It also allows teachers to examine and reflect upon the assessment values and approaches as part of their teaching.

5. Conclusion and implications

We have proposed 360  feedback system in a holistic manner for enhancing student- centred learning. We adopt the term 360  feedback system instead of the existing terms such as cooperative assessment or collaborative assessment because they emphasise only parts of the equation. The system proposed aims to provide a means for a more rounded feedback in teaching and learning. It utilises a mix of self-, peer and teacher assessments and places primary focus on a dialogic communication to engage all stakeholders proactively in the learning process. Moreover, it promotes congeniality and collegiality in  assessment for learning . Congeniality weakens the image of teachers as the unques- tionable authority but recognises the importance of negotiated criteria, of autonomous and creative discourse among teachers and students (Sadler [1983](#_page13_x0.00_y702.99)). In addition, the 360 feedback system promotes collegiality by leveraging on the cooperative relationship among all stakeholders in the learning process to support one another.

The complexity of enhancing student learning experience has many facets, yet past research and policy demonstrate a proclivity towards an ad hoc and disjointed effort of focusing on single or a very narrow set of facets. A holistic perspective with an integrative approach, i.e. 360  feedback system offers potential as a fruitful teaching and

learning system for the benefit of all stakeholders. Part of the value of 360  feedback system lies in its potential to engage all stakeholders proactively in teaching and learning, guided by core elements of feedback. The integrated system enables novel actions to be formulated and implemented, since it allows disaggregation of understanding into pinpointed actions and activities for the transformation of assessment feedback into student-centred experience in teaching and learning. Effective learning comes about through interaction of the core elements underpinning the system. The combined effect of timely, prompt and regular feedback, quality engagement, quantity of feedback staggered by sequential stages, positive social pressure, self-reflection, and dialogic feedback communication when implemented in an integrated and organised whole will facilitate and enhance student learning.

The 360  feedback system presented here focuses on its implementation in the classroom settings of courses offered by management discipline. However, application of the 360  feedback system has the potential to be used in other disciplines and in non- classroom settings. Different disciplines such as fine art and engineering have different student needs and forms of assessments. Nonetheless, the three-stage approach and feedback components are generic enough to be applicable to such contexts but the intervention, which in this case was a poster presentation, is likely to require adjustment according to the specific needs and the context. As such, different contexts and types of intervention warrant further research attention.
