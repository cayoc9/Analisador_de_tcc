## Conceptualization and Theoretical Foundation of the 360° Assessment Paradigm in the Context of Self-Directed Learning (SDL)
The 360° assessment paradigm, also known as multi-source feedback, is a comprehensive evaluation approach that integrates feedback from various sources, including self-assessment, peer review, teacher feedback, and external evaluation. This approach is deeply rooted in the principles of Self-Directed Learning (SDL), where learners take ownership of their learning process, developing critical skills such as self-reflection, autonomy, and lifelong learning  (Tee & Ahmed, 2014)  (Harrison et al., 2015).
### Origins and Adaptations to the Educational Environment
The 360° assessment paradigm originated in organizational settings as a tool for employee development, focusing on multi-rater feedback to provide a holistic view of an individual's performance. In the educational context, this approach has been adapted to align with the needs of SDL. It emphasizes the importance of multiple perspectives in assessing student learning, fostering a more inclusive and reflective learning environment  (Ladyshewsky & Taplin, 2015)  (Corbi et al., 2019).

The adaptation of 360° assessments in education involves the integration of self-assessment, peer review, and teacher feedback. This approach is particularly effective in higher education, where the development of self-directed learners is a key objective. By incorporating multiple sources of feedback, students gain a more comprehensive understanding of their strengths and areas for improvement, which is essential for SDL  (Martínez-Romera & Cortés-Dumont, 2022)  (Aragón, 2018).
### Integrative Components of the 360° Assessment Paradigm
The 360° assessment paradigm is characterized by its integrative components, which work together to create a holistic evaluation system. These components include:
#### *1. Self-Assessment*
Self-assessment is a critical component of the 360° assessment paradigm. It involves students evaluating their own performance, setting goals, and reflecting on their learning outcomes. Research has shown that self-assessment contributes to the improvement of students' final grades and enhances their ability to take ownership of their learning  (Aragón, 2018)  (Sosibo, 2019).
#### *2. Peer Review*
Peer review involves students evaluating the work of their peers, providing constructive feedback. This component fosters critical thinking, communication, and collaboration skills. Studies have demonstrated that peer review enhances the quality of feedback and prepares students to construct insightful feedback, which is essential for SDL  (Garcia-Souto et al., 2017)  (Sluijsmans et al., 1998).
#### *3. Teacher Feedback*
Teacher feedback is a traditional yet essential component of the 360° assessment paradigm. It provides students with expert guidance, helping them to refine their skills and understand their progress. When combined with self-assessment and peer review, teacher feedback creates a balanced and comprehensive evaluation system  (Martínez-Romera & Cortés-Dumont, 2022)  (Leibowitz, 2016).
#### *4. External Evaluation*
External evaluation involves feedback from external stakeholders, such as industry professionals or alumni. This component provides students with insights into the expectations of the professional world, enhancing the relevance of their learning experience  (Moreno, 2013)  (Heisler, 1996).
### Practical Implementation and Tools in Computer Science Degree Training
The practical implementation of the 360° assessment paradigm in computer science degree training involves the use of specific tools and procedures. These tools are designed to facilitate the collection, analysis, and dissemination of feedback from multiple sources.
#### *Tools for 360° Feedback*
1. **Moodle and Wiki Functionality**: The use of Moodle, a learning management system, and Wiki tools has been shown to support cooperative learning and self-directed learning. These tools enable students to collaborate, provide peer feedback, and reflect on their learning outcomes  (Molins & Català, 2022)  (Plataforma Moodle Uma Tecnologia Inovadora: Reflexões, Aprendizagem Autodirigida e Design Instrucional, 2023).
1. **Standardized Computing Environments**: The use of standardized computing environments, such as stored procedures and Structured Query Language (SQL), has been advocated for the processing of 360° feedback data. These environments facilitate complex calculations and provide a scalable solution for large-scale assessments  (Corbi et al., 2019)  (Martínez-Romera & Cortés-Dumont, 2022).
#### *Procedures for Implementation*
1. **Design of Assessment Activities**: The design of assessment activities should encourage cooperative learning and self-directed learning. For example, students can work on group projects and provide feedback to each other, fostering a sense of responsibility and accountability  (Molins & Català, 2022)  (Alves et al., 2022).
1. **Training and Support**: Students and teachers should receive training on the use of 360° feedback tools and procedures. This training should focus on the development of skills such as critical thinking, communication, and reflection  (Hernández, 2022)  (Silva et al., 2021).
### Contribution to the Development of Students' Self-Direction
The 360° assessment paradigm makes a significant contribution to the development of students' self-direction. By providing multiple sources of feedback, this approach enables students to gain a deeper understanding of their learning outcomes and take ownership of their learning process.
#### *1. Enhanced Self-Awareness*
Self-assessment and peer review components of the 360° assessment paradigm enhance students' self-awareness. By reflecting on their own performance and the feedback from others, students develop a better understanding of their strengths and areas for improvement  (Harrison et al., 2015)  (Sosibo, 2019).
#### *2. Improved Critical Thinking and Reflection*
The process of providing and receiving feedback fosters critical thinking and reflection. Students learn to analyze their own work and the work of others, developing the skills necessary for lifelong learning  (Garcia-Souto et al., 2017)  (Sluijsmans et al., 1998).
#### *3. Increased Autonomy*
The 360° assessment paradigm promotes autonomy by encouraging students to take control of their learning. By setting goals and reflecting on their progress, students develop the skills necessary to direct their own learning  (Harrison et al., 2015)  (Sosibo, 2019).
### Challenges and Strategies for Overcoming Assessment and Self-Direction in Computer Science Education
The implementation of the 360° assessment paradigm in computer science education is not without challenges. These challenges include the complexity of the assessment process, the potential for bias in feedback, and the need for significant resources and support.
#### *1. Addressing Complexity*
The complexity of the 360° assessment process can be addressed by simplifying the design of assessment activities and providing clear guidelines for students and teachers. The use of standardized tools and procedures can also help to streamline the process  (Corbi et al., 2019)  (Martínez-Romera & Cortés-Dumont, 2022).
#### *2. Minimizing Bias*
The potential for bias in feedback can be minimized by providing training on the use of objective criteria and encouraging students to focus on specific aspects of performance. The use of multiple sources of feedback can also help to balance out individual biases  (Martínez-Romera & Cortés-Dumont, 2022)  (Leibowitz, 2016).
#### *3. Ensuring Adequate Resources and Support*
The successful implementation of the 360° assessment paradigm requires adequate resources and support. This includes the development of appropriate tools, the training of students and teachers, and the allocation of sufficient time for the assessment process  (Hernández, 2022)  (Silva et al., 2021).
### Brazilian Evaluative Culture
The Brazilian evaluative culture presents unique challenges for the implementation of the 360° assessment paradigm. These challenges include the traditional emphasis on summative evaluation and the underuse of self-assessment in distance education.
#### *1. Promoting Formative Evaluation*
The promotion of formative evaluation is essential for fostering a culture of continuous improvement. This can be achieved by increasing the use of self-assessment and peer review, and by providing students with regular feedback on their progress  (Alves et al., 2022)  (Silva et al., 2021).
#### *2. Encouraging Autonomy and Responsibility*
The development of autonomy and responsibility in students is critical for the success of the 360° assessment paradigm. This can be achieved by encouraging students to take ownership of their learning and by providing them with the skills and support necessary for self-directed learning  (Harrison et al., 2015)  (Sosibo, 2019).
#### *3. Addressing the Underuse of Self-Assessment*
The underuse of self-assessment in distance education can be addressed by increasing awareness of its importance and by providing students with opportunities to engage in self-assessment activities. The integration of self-assessment into the curriculum and the use of appropriate tools can also help to promote its use  (Silva et al., 2021)  (Marxreiter et al., 2021).
### Conclusion
The 360° assessment paradigm offers a comprehensive and integrative approach to evaluation, which is particularly effective in the context of Self-Directed Learning. By incorporating multiple sources of feedback, this approach fosters self-awareness, critical thinking, and autonomy, all of which are essential for the development of self-directed learners. The practical implementation of this paradigm in computer science education requires careful planning, adequate resources, and a commitment to fostering a culture of continuous improvement. Despite the challenges, the benefits of the 360° assessment paradigm make it a valuable tool for promoting SDL in higher education.
