Self-directed learning is essential in assisting nurses to meet the challenges presented in today's health care environment. Nurse educators have an important role to play in assisting nurses to acquire the skills for self-directed learning, and to do this they need to understand the concept of self-directed learning.


AIM
The aim of this review is to explore the concept of self-directed learning and its use in nurse education.


METHODS
A review of the literature was conducted using CINAHL, Medline and other databases and the keywords 'self-directed learning', 'student nurses', 'classroom', 'nursing education' and 'adult education'.


FINDINGS
The concept of self-directed learning is based on the principles of adult education and can take many different formats. Self-directed learning has many benefits. However, acquiring the necessary skills is dependent on a students' preference and readiness for self-directed learning and nurse educators' implementation of the concept. In implementing self-directed learning, nurse educators become facilitators of learning and require ongoing staff development. Not all students are self-directed and a variety of teaching methods should be used in curricula.


CONCLUSIONS
A consensus definition of the concept of lifelong learning does not exist, and students and teachers may have different perspectives on it. Mature students may be more self-directing than school-leavers, and learning styles and readiness to learn need to be assessed when judging the appropriateness of using self-directed learning approaches. However, there are many potential benefits, including increased confidence, autonomy, motivation and preparation for lifelong learning.",211023614,314,72,,"acesso_comPDF, aprendizagem autodirigida, revisao_sistematica"

However, the reasons why volitional control might result in superior acquisition and the limits to such advantages remain poorly understood. In this article, we review the issue from both a cognitive and computational perspective. On the cognitive side, self-directed learning allows individuals to focus effort on useful information they do not yet possess, can expose information that is inaccessible via passive observation, and may enhance the encoding and retention of materials. On the computational side, the development of efficient “active learning” algorithms that can select their own training data is an emerging research topic in machine learning.

Self-directed learning has been recommended as a promising methodology for lifelong learning in medicine. However, the concept of self-directed learning continues to be elusive, with students and educators finding difficulty in defining it and agreeing on its worth.


METHODS
In this paper we review the literature of self-directed learning in health professions education and present a framework based on Malcolm Knowles' key components of self-directed learning.


RESULTS
The key components of self-directed learning are: the educator as a facilitator, identification of learning needs, development of learning objectives, identification of appropriate resources, implementation of the process, commitment to a learning contract and evaluation of learning. Several but not all of these components are often described in the published literature.


CONCLUSION
Although the presented framework provides some consistency for educators interested in applying SDL methods, future studies are needed to standardise self-directed learning curricula and to determine the effectiveness of these components on educational outcomes.",20112800,128,68,,"aprendizagem autodirigida, saude"

To discuss the meaning of self-directed learning, challenges with implementation, and strategies to overcome obstacles in educational settings. In this paper we define self-directed learning, differentiate it from similar terminology, and discuss the empirical evidence for its development and strategies for its use within higher education. Summary. Self-directed learning as a defined teaching pedagogy has been around since the 1960s and can be used in classroom and experiential settings. It is a term that is commonly used to describe a set of skills that college graduates should possess. A self-directed learning environment is dramatically different from a lecture-based classroom where the educator determines the goals, the assessments administered, and pacing of the course content. During the self-directed learning process, the learner sets goals, determines how progress will be assessed, defines the structure and sequence of activities and a timeline, identifies resources, and seeks out feedback. When teaching individuals who are new to this model, care must be taken to appropriately scaffold and structure learning to develop the underlying soft skills needed for students to be successful as self-directed learners. When implementing this pedagogy in a classroom setting, challenges are faced both by the learner and the educator. Faculty members should proactively plan for potential challenges during the course design process.",202737822,104,32,,"aprendizagem autodirigida, referencial teorico"

This conception is inadequate because it fails to account for persistence in learning and excludes adults who are unable to plan self-instruction. These inadequacies, however, can be addressed by studying self-directed learning as it relates to the learner's personality. Linking self-directed learning and personality has several advantages: Self-directed learning could be studied independent of the mode of learning an individual selects, a relatively stable indicator of self-directed learning-personality-would be available for study, and the personality characteristics leading an individual to initiate and persist in learning would provide a more unified and comprehensive focus for the study of self-directed learning.",196428463,103,46,,"acesso_comPDF, aprendizagem autodirigida"

Outstanding provision reflected a collaborative relationship between teacher and learner in directing the learning process, despite the Ofsted framework not explicitly identifying the need for learner involvement in directing the learning process.

Singh",Indian Pediatrics,2022,"Self-directed learning (SDL) is a modality where learners are expected to take responsibility for their own learning, diagnose gaps in their learning, frame their own goals and resources for learning, implement appropriate learning strategies and evaluate learning outcomes. Flexibility and creativity in designing assignments for students to work individually or collaboratively are the keys to promoting SDL. The recent competency-based curriculum document from the National Medical Commission does not elaborate the concept or implementation of SDL, leaving it open to individual interpretation. We, herein, discuss the concept of SDL, address common misconceptions surrounding SDL, and elucidate strategies by which SDL skills can be inculcated in medical students using pre-existing opportunities in the curriculum. Flipped classrooms, reciprocal teaching, technology-enhanced methods, problem-based learning, and group projects are excellent ways of promoting SDL. SDL requires efforts and policies both at the teachers’ level and at the institutional level; and is an important input to achieve the goal of being a lifelong learner by the Indian medical graduate.",12239049,15,34,,"Aprendiz_Universitario, aprendizagem autodirigida"

Self-directed learning is best introduced to students during the transition period from high school to the university (Van et al., 2015), and then reinforced throughout the university years. Interestingly, self-directed learning does not end within the university walls-it does exist beyond those walls. Hence, there is the need to nurture it during the university years so it can blossom afterwards. Early introduction or reinforcement of self-directed learning to university students is crucial because it can help students get accustomed to being self-directed in their learning at the university and beyond, thereby developing their critical thinking skills. The benefit of self-directed learning activities includes critical thinking skills, cooperative learning skills, freedom in learning, ICT, research skills, and other useful skills.",254054048,6,32,,"Ate_10_anos, aprendizagem autodirigida"
(missing DOI),Examination of The Big Five And Narrow Traits In Relation To Learner Self-Direction,Jeral R. Kirwan,(missing journal),2012,"Self-direction in learning is a major topic in the field of adult learning. There has been extensive coverage of the topic by theorists, researchers, and practitioners. However, there have been few studies which look at learner self-direction specifically as a personality trait. The present study addresses the relationship between learner selfdirection and other personality traits of college students when the traits represented by the five-factor model of personality (Digman, 1990) are differentiated from narrow personality traits. Archival data were used from an undergraduate sample at a large Southeastern U.S. university (sample size = 2102). Correlation and multiple regression analyses were used in examining the unique individual relationship between Big Five and narrow personality traits and learner self-direction. Analysis of the data revealed five significant part correlations between specific traits and learner self-direction. The part correlations for Work Drive (.310) and Openness (.207) were significantly higher than all other part correlations. Neither Conscientiousness nor Agreeableness had significant part correlations despite having significant zero-order correlations with learner self-direction. Extraversion did not have a significant zero-order correlation with learner self-direction but the part correlation was significant. Results were discussed in terms of the predictive relationship between personality variables and learner self-direction. Study implications, some limitations, and possible directions for future research were noted. Table of",115976145,2,171,,"acesso_comPDF, aprendizagem autodirigida"

Methodology: The argument for this study anchored on Vygosky’s Social Constructivism Theory, Cognitive Apprenticeship Theory of Collins et al., and Tchombe’s Mediated Mutual Reciprocity Theory. A correlational survey research design, with a quantitative approach for data collection was used. A sample of 254 students, derived using two probability (stratified random and simple random) sampling techniques and two non-probability (convenience and purposive) sampling techniques, participated in this study. Data obtained were analyzed descriptively and inferentially. The Spearman’s Rho correlation test was used to test the specific research hypotheses. 
Findings: Findings showed that, there is a significant and positive relationship between identification of learning problems and development of competencies among students (P<0.000) (R=0.410**). Similarly, findings on hypothesis two showed that there is a significant relationship between application of appropriate learning strategies and development of competencies among students (P<0.027)(R=0.139*). Lastly, findings on hypothesis three showed that there is a significant relationship between assessment and evaluation of learning and development of competencies among students (P<0.000) (R=0.525**). 
Recommendations: Based on these findings, it was recommended that there is need for bias towards action, a competence-based curriculum, and respect of format, frequency and feedback for assessment and evaluation. Additionally, Universities should adopt the SDL model as a learning strategy and develop strategies to overcome obstacles that hinder its application, as well as train teachers on the didactics of the blended learning model.",231755999,2,30,,aprendizagem autodirigida

The volume provides strategies and approaches to promote self-directed learning (SDL) in blended learning environments, featuring contributions from authors experienced in active learning strategies in online and blended learning contexts. They emphasise the importance of technology-enhanced learning, particularly blended learning, in improving students’ overall learning experience by promoting SDL. The book, which is licensed for free use, consists of 10 chapters that delve into various pedagogical methods to enhance SDL in blended learning contexts. The target audience for this book is scholars and practitioners who are interested in enhancing SDL, specifically in blended learning environments. The book begins by setting a theoretical foundation for the subsequent chapters. In Chapter 1, van der Westhuizen and Bailey highlight the importance of aligning the person-process-context (PCC) model with the Community of Inquiry (CoI) framework to guide SDL. In this chapter, the authors propose a model for SDL and make a case for combining PCC and CoI to create optimal learning experiences for individuals in blended learning environments. This approach was quite effective in shaping the overall logic of the subsequent chapters. In Chapter 2, Kruger and colleagues offer a literature review to conceptualise inquiry-based, blended, and self-directed learning, and they elucidate the connections between these three learning approaches. Although this chapter is consistent with the book’s overall theme and focus, it places particular emphasis on the affective domain of learning.

Boyer",(missing journal),2012,"This article is a meta-analytic study examining the relationship between self-directed learning and constructs that have received research attention in the education domain including academic performance, future aspiration, creativity, curiosity, and life satisfaction. Meta-analytic results show that self-directed learning is significantly and positively related to academic performance (r = .15, p < .001), future aspiration (r = .13, p < .001), creativity (r = .25, p < .001), curiosity (r = .40, p < .01), and life satisfaction (r = .35, p < .001). These results show that self-directed learning is an important construct and should be implemented into business education. INTRODUCTION Helping students get more out of their learning experience is a number one goal of teaching and training institutions. Therefore, this article seeks to uncover constructs that may improve student learning in marketing education, by examining research on learning effectiveness in the education domain related to adult learning. A prominent construct that emerged out of the adult education literature in the 1960s is self-directed learning. Self-directed learning (SDL) has been a central tenet in the adult education literature since then (Brockett and Hiemstra 1991; Mezirow 1985). In fact, it is the most common form of adult learning (Merriam and Caffarella 1999). However, the concept of selfdirected learning in the marketing education literature has been extremely limited. Self-directed learning has been defined as a process in which learners take the initiative in planning, implementing, and evaluating their own learning needs and outcomes, with or without the help of others (Knowles 1975). One of the key characteristics of self-directed learning is that learners must take some responsibility for their own learning over and above responding to instruction (Boud 1981). Self-directed learning, as a supplement to the traditional learning approach, provides learners with a greater opportunity to reach their own potential (Boyer, Edmondson, and Artis 2011). Therefore by adding self-directed learning to traditional learning approaches (i.e. lecture), educators will be better able to keep students engaged. The purpose of this article is to introduce self-directed learning to the marketing education literature through the completion of a meta-analysis on the existing self-directed learning literature, from multiple disciplines. By understanding what is already known about self-directed learning, marketing educators will have a better understanding of how to enhance marketing courses, professional education and student learning by utilizing self-directed learning approaches in adult student development.",894016,49,34,,"aprendizagem autodirigida, revisao_sistematica"
