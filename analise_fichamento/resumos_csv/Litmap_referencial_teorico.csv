(missing DOI),SELF-DIRECTED LEARNING: A META-ANALYTIC REVIEW OF ADULT LEARNING CONSTRUCTS,"Diane R. Edmondson, Stefanie L. Boyer",(missing journal),2012,"This article is a meta-analytic study examining the relationship between self-directed learning and constructs that have received research attention in the education domain including academic performance, future aspiration, creativity, curiosity, and life satisfaction. Meta-analytic results show that self-directed learning is significantly and positively related to academic performance (r = .15, p < .001), future aspiration (r = .13, p < .001), creativity (r = .25, p < .001), curiosity (r = .40, p < .01), and life satisfaction (r = .35, p < .001). These results show that self-directed learning is an important construct and should be implemented into business education. INTRODUCTION Helping students get more out of their learning experience is a number one goal of teaching and training institutions. Therefore, this article seeks to uncover constructs that may improve student learning in marketing education, by examining research on learning effectiveness in the education domain related to adult learning. A prominent construct that emerged out of the adult education literature in the 1960s is self-directed learning. Self-directed learning (SDL) has been a central tenet in the adult education literature since then (Brockett and Hiemstra 1991; Mezirow 1985). In fact, it is the most common form of adult learning (Merriam and Caffarella 1999). However, the concept of selfdirected learning in the marketing education literature has been extremely limited. Self-directed learning has been defined as a process in which learners take the initiative in planning, implementing, and evaluating their own learning needs and outcomes, with or without the help of others (Knowles 1975). One of the key characteristics of self-directed learning is that learners must take some responsibility for their own learning over and above responding to instruction (Boud 1981). Self-directed learning, as a supplement to the traditional learning approach, provides learners with a greater opportunity to reach their own potential (Boyer, Edmondson, and Artis 2011). Therefore by adding self-directed learning to traditional learning approaches (i.e. lecture), educators will be better able to keep students engaged. The purpose of this article is to introduce self-directed learning to the marketing education literature through the completion of a meta-analysis on the existing self-directed learning literature, from multiple disciplines. By understanding what is already known about self-directed learning, marketing educators will have a better understanding of how to enhance marketing courses, professional education and student learning by utilizing self-directed learning approaches in adult student development.",894016,49,34,,"aprendizagem autodirigida, revisao_sistematica"

The volume provides strategies and approaches to promote self-directed learning (SDL) in blended learning environments, featuring contributions from authors experienced in active learning strategies in online and blended learning contexts. They emphasise the importance of technology-enhanced learning, particularly blended learning, in improving students’ overall learning experience by promoting SDL. The book, which is licensed for free use, consists of 10 chapters that delve into various pedagogical methods to enhance SDL in blended learning contexts. The target audience for this book is scholars and practitioners who are interested in enhancing SDL, specifically in blended learning environments. The book begins by setting a theoretical foundation for the subsequent chapters. In Chapter 1, van der Westhuizen and Bailey highlight the importance of aligning the person-process-context (PCC) model with the Community of Inquiry (CoI) framework to guide SDL. In this chapter, the authors propose a model for SDL and make a case for combining PCC and CoI to create optimal learning experiences for individuals in blended learning environments. This approach was quite effective in shaping the overall logic of the subsequent chapters. In Chapter 2, Kruger and colleagues offer a literature review to conceptualise inquiry-based, blended, and self-directed learning, and they elucidate the connections between these three learning approaches. Although this chapter is consistent with the book’s overall theme and focus, it places particular emphasis on the affective domain of learning. The authors argue that the affective domain is a shared element among all three learning approaches and could serve as a catalyst for enhancing self-directed",266923260,0,0,,aprendizagem autodirigida

Self-directed learning has been recommended as a promising methodology for lifelong learning in medicine. However, the concept of self-directed learning continues to be elusive, with students and educators finding difficulty in defining it and agreeing on its worth.


METHODS
In this paper we review the literature of self-directed learning in health professions education and present a framework based on Malcolm Knowles' key components of self-directed learning.


RESULTS
The key components of self-directed learning are: the educator as a facilitator, identification of learning needs, development of learning objectives, identification of appropriate resources, implementation of the process, commitment to a learning contract and evaluation of learning. Several but not all of these components are often described in the published literature.


CONCLUSION
Although the presented framework provides some consistency for educators interested in applying SDL methods, future studies are needed to standardise self-directed learning curricula and to determine the effectiveness of these components on educational outcomes.",20112800,128,68,,"aprendizagem autodirigida, saude"

The recent competency-based curriculum document from the National Medical Commission does not elaborate the concept or implementation of SDL, leaving it open to individual interpretation. We, herein, discuss the concept of SDL, address common misconceptions surrounding SDL, and elucidate strategies by which SDL skills can be inculcated in medical students using pre-existing opportunities in the curriculum. Flipped classrooms, reciprocal teaching, technology-enhanced methods, problem-based learning, and group projects are excellent ways of promoting SDL.

To discuss the meaning of self-directed learning, challenges with implementation, and strategies to overcome obstacles in educational settings. In this paper we define self-directed learning, differentiate it from similar terminology, and discuss the empirical evidence for its development and strategies for its use within higher education. Summary. Self-directed learning as a defined teaching pedagogy has been around since the 1960s and can be used in classroom and experiential settings. It is a term that is commonly used to describe a set of skills that college graduates should possess. A self-directed learning environment is dramatically different from a lecture-based classroom where the educator determines the goals, the assessments administered, and pacing of the course content. During the self-directed learning process, the learner sets goals, determines how progress will be assessed, defines the structure and sequence of activities and a timeline, identifies resources, and seeks out feedback. When teaching individuals who are new to this model, care must be taken to appropriately scaffold and structure learning to develop the underlying soft skills needed for students to be successful as self-directed learners. When implementing this pedagogy in a classroom setting, challenges are faced both by the learner and the educator. Faculty members should proactively plan for potential challenges during the course design process.",202737822,104,32,,"aprendizagem autodirigida, referencial teorico"

Self-directed learning is essential in assisting nurses to meet the challenges presented in today's health care environment. Nurse educators have an important role to play in assisting nurses to acquire the skills for self-directed learning, and to do this they need to understand the concept of self-directed learning.


AIM
The aim of this review is to explore the concept of self-directed learning and its use in nurse education.


METHODS
A review of the literature was conducted using CINAHL, Medline and other databases and the keywords 'self-directed learning', 'student nurses', 'classroom', 'nursing education' and 'adult education'.


FINDINGS
The concept of self-directed learning is based on the principles of adult education and can take many different formats. Self-directed learning has many benefits. However, acquiring the necessary skills is dependent on a students' preference and readiness for self-directed learning and nurse educators' implementation of the concept. In implementing self-directed learning, nurse educators become facilitators of learning and require ongoing staff development. Not all students are self-directed and a variety of teaching methods should be used in curricula.


CONCLUSIONS
A consensus definition of the concept of lifelong learning does not exist, and students and teachers may have different perspectives on it. Mature students may be more self-directing than school-leavers, and learning styles and readiness to learn need to be assessed when judging the appropriateness of using self-directed learning approaches. However, there are many potential benefits, including increased confidence, autonomy, motivation and preparation for lifelong learning.",211023614,314,72,,"acesso_comPDF, aprendizagem autodirigida, revisao_sistematica"

Archival data were used from an undergraduate sample at a large Southeastern U.S. university (sample size = 2102). Correlation and multiple regression analyses were used in examining the unique individual relationship between Big Five and narrow personality traits and learner self-direction. Analysis of the data revealed five significant part correlations between specific traits and learner self-direction. The part correlations for Work Drive (.310) and Openness (.207) were significantly higher than all other part correlations. Neither Conscientiousness nor Agreeableness had significant part correlations despite having significant zero-order correlations with learner self-direction. Extraversion did not have a significant zero-order correlation with learner self-direction but the part correlation was significant. Results were discussed in terms of the predictive relationship between personality variables and learner self-direction. Study implications, some limitations, and possible directions for future research were noted. Table of",115976145,2,171,,"acesso_comPDF, aprendizagem autodirigida"
(missing DOI),An Analysis of the Characteristics of Self-Directed Learners and Strategies to Enhance Self-Directed Learning in Education Systems: Transcending Boundaries,N. Edwards,(missing journal),2015,"Education can allow individuals to transcend boundaries of space, identity, and culture by empowering learners with the ability to pursue self-directed, lifelong learning. Valuable new meanings and understandings can be created by the interaction between self-motivated, self-directed learners, communities, and a wide range of organizations (Rogers, 2004). A shift away from traditional, teacher-centered power relations towards learner-centered approaches can significantly enhance learning and create the intrinsic motivation necessary to enable effective, dynamic, lifelong learning processes. Intrinsic motivation is an essential element of self-directed learning (Cross, 1992). Self-directed learners are skilled at teaching others and at overcoming barriers to communication and mutual understanding. Self-motivated learners understand the viewpoints of other learners and are skillful at sharing experiences and knowledge (Kalantzis, 2003). Mentors play a useful role as guides and advisors in self-directed learning. One of the most important, fundamental goals of education may be to create the conditions that lead to intrinsic motivation and a lifetime of self-directed learning (Lewis, 1995). Self-directed learning is becoming increasingly important in the global economy and international society and is associated with adult learners that exhibit common characteristics. Self-reflection is a key aspect of lifelong learning and leads to a better understanding of one's own strengths and weaknesses. Self-directed learners are engaged emotionally in the learning process and are able to monitor and adjust their own learning. Learner-centered learning strategies can be employed to enhance and promote the traits of self-directed learners and lifelong learning for the benefit of individuals and society.",49615089,2,15,,"acesso_comPDF, aprendizagem autodirigida"
