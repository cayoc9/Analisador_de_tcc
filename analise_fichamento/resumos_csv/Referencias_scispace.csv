(missing DOI),A Conceptual Model for Understanding Self-Directed Learning in Online Environments.,"Liyan Song, Janette R. Hill",Journal of Interactive Online Learning,2007,"Research indicates that online learning often situates control of implementation with the learner. Recently, scholars have turned attention to the importance of self-directed learning (SDL) skills for online learning environments. Existing frameworks for understanding SDL focus primarily on process and personal attributes in face-to-face settings. Some frameworks depict SDL as a process, focusing on learner autonomy in the learning processes; other frameworks emphasize personal attributes, focusing on learner’s capabilities of regulating the learning process. Yet, the level of self-direction needed may change in different contexts. The purpose of this paper is to introduce a research-based framework for understanding SDL in online learning contexts. Implications for future research and practice are provided at the end of the paper.",261532317,426,33,,

(missing DOI),SELF-DIRECTED LEARNING: A META-ANALYTIC REVIEW OF ADULT LEARNING CONSTRUCTS,"Diane R. Edmondson, Stefanie L. Boyer",(missing journal),2012,"This article is a meta-analytic study examining the relationship between self-directed learning and constructs that have received research attention in the education domain including academic performance, future aspiration, creativity, curiosity, and life satisfaction. Meta-analytic results show that self-directed learning is significantly and positively related to academic performance (r = .15, p < .001), future aspiration (r = .13, p < .001), creativity (r = .25, p < .001), curiosity (r = .40, p < .01), and life satisfaction (r = .35, p < .001). These results show that self-directed learning is an important construct and should be implemented into business education. INTRODUCTION Helping students get more out of their learning experience is a number one goal of teaching and training institutions. Therefore, this article seeks to uncover constructs that may improve student learning in marketing education, by examining research on learning effectiveness in the education domain related to adult learning. A prominent construct that emerged out of the adult education literature in the 1960s is self-directed learning. Self-directed learning (SDL) has been a central tenet in the adult education literature since then (Brockett and Hiemstra 1991; Mezirow 1985). In fact, it is the most common form of adult learning (Merriam and Caffarella 1999). However, the concept of selfdirected learning in the marketing education literature has been extremely limited. Self-directed learning has been defined as a process in which learners take the initiative in planning, implementing, and evaluating their own learning needs and outcomes, with or without the help of others (Knowles 1975). One of the key characteristics of self-directed learning is that learners must take some responsibility for their own learning over and above responding to instruction (Boud 1981). Self-directed learning, as a supplement to the traditional learning approach, provides learners with a greater opportunity to reach their own potential (Boyer, Edmondson, and Artis 2011). Therefore by adding self-directed learning to traditional learning approaches (i.e. lecture), educators will be better able to keep students engaged. The purpose of this article is to introduce self-directed learning to the marketing education literature through the completion of a meta-analysis on the existing self-directed learning literature, from multiple disciplines. By understanding what is already known about self-directed learning, marketing educators will have a better understanding of how to enhance marketing courses, professional education and student learning by utilizing self-directed learning approaches in adult student development.",88869286,49,33,,

The volume provides strategies and approaches to promote self-directed learning (SDL) in blended learning environments, featuring contributions from authors experienced in active learning strategies in online and blended learning contexts. They emphasise the importance of technology-enhanced learning, particularly blended learning, in improving students’ overall learning experience by promoting SDL. The book, which is licensed for free use, consists of 10 chapters that delve into various pedagogical methods to enhance SDL in blended learning contexts. The target audience for this book is scholars and practitioners who are interested in enhancing SDL, specifically in blended learning environments. The book begins by setting a theoretical foundation for the subsequent chapters. In Chapter 1, van der Westhuizen and Bailey highlight the importance of aligning the person-process-context (PCC) model with the Community of Inquiry (CoI) framework to guide SDL. In this chapter, the authors propose a model for SDL and make a case for combining PCC and CoI to create optimal learning experiences for individuals in blended learning environments. This approach was quite effective in shaping the overall logic of the subsequent chapters. In Chapter 2, Kruger and colleagues offer a literature review to conceptualise inquiry-based, blended, and self-directed learning, and they elucidate the connections between these three learning approaches. Although this chapter is consistent with the book’s overall theme and focus, it places particular emphasis on the affective domain of learning. The authors argue that the affective domain is a shared element among all three learning approaches and could serve as a catalyst for enhancing self-directed",266923260,0,0,,

Self-directed learning has been recommended as a promising methodology for lifelong learning in medicine. However, the concept of self-directed learning continues to be elusive, with students and educators finding difficulty in defining it and agreeing on its worth.


METHODS
In this paper we review the literature of self-directed learning in health professions education and present a framework based on Malcolm Knowles' key components of self-directed learning.


RESULTS
The key components of self-directed learning are: the educator as a facilitator, identification of learning needs, development of learning objectives, identification of appropriate resources, implementation of the process, commitment to a learning contract and evaluation of learning. Several but not all of these components are often described in the published literature.


CONCLUSION
Although the presented framework provides some consistency for educators interested in applying SDL methods, future studies are needed to standardise self-directed learning curricula and to determine the effectiveness of these components on educational outcomes.",20112800,128,68,,

Singh",Indian Pediatrics,2022,"Self-directed learning (SDL) is a modality where learners are expected to take responsibility for their own learning, diagnose gaps in their learning, frame their own goals and resources for learning, implement appropriate learning strategies and evaluate learning outcomes. Flexibility and creativity in designing assignments for students to work individually or collaboratively are the keys to promoting SDL. The recent competency-based curriculum document from the National Medical Commission does not elaborate the concept or implementation of SDL, leaving it open to individual interpretation. We, herein, discuss the concept of SDL, address common misconceptions surrounding SDL, and elucidate strategies by which SDL skills can be inculcated in medical students using pre-existing opportunities in the curriculum. Flipped classrooms, reciprocal teaching, technology-enhanced methods, problem-based learning, and group projects are excellent ways of promoting SDL. SDL requires efforts and policies both at the teachers’ level and at the institutional level; and is an important input to achieve the goal of being a lifelong learner by the Indian medical graduate.",12239049,15,34,,

To discuss the meaning of self-directed learning, challenges with implementation, and strategies to overcome obstacles in educational settings. In this paper we define self-directed learning, differentiate it from similar terminology, and discuss the empirical evidence for its development and strategies for its use within higher education. Summary. Self-directed learning as a defined teaching pedagogy has been around since the 1960s and can be used in classroom and experiential settings. It is a term that is commonly used to describe a set of skills that college graduates should possess. A self-directed learning environment is dramatically different from a lecture-based classroom where the educator determines the goals, the assessments administered, and pacing of the course content. During the self-directed learning process, the learner sets goals, determines how progress will be assessed, defines the structure and sequence of activities and a timeline, identifies resources, and seeks out feedback. When teaching individuals who are new to this model, care must be taken to appropriately scaffold and structure learning to develop the underlying soft skills needed for students to be successful as self-directed learners. When implementing this pedagogy in a classroom setting, challenges are faced both by the learner and the educator. Faculty members should proactively plan for potential challenges during the course design process.",202737822,104,32,,

This study investigated the relationship among motivation, self-monitoring, self-management, and MOOC learners’ use of learning strategies. An online survey was embedded at the end of three MOOCs with large enrollments asking for learners’ voluntary participation in the study. The survey results from 470 participants indicated that motivation positively influenced self-monitoring, self-management, and learning strategies. In addition, self-monitoring and self-management did not affect the utilization of learning strategies. This underscores learners’ motivation and the need to encourage them to adopt appropriate learning strategies for successful learning. The results also revealed that self-monitoring positively affected self-management. The findings highlight the critical need to enhance self-monitoring skills to further promote self-management skills in MOOCs. In addition, self-monitoring and self-management did not encourage learners to use related learning strategies in this study. This study should be extended to investigate practical ways to encourage MOOC learners to adopt learning strategies.",220124132,36,90,,
