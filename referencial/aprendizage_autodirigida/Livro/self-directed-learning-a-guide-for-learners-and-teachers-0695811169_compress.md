## Orientation

As the book'  subtitle states, this book is designed to be s used by  both learners  and  teachers.  The  results  will  be best if it is used by them together. In such case, it would be helpful if each of them read both Parts  I  and II,  so as to understand in  advance their respective roles.  Then the initiative may  be taken by either party:  the learners can suggest actions the teacher might take, and the teacher can  suggest  actions  the  learners  might  take.

But learners can use the book as a resource for devel­ oping their own competence as self-directed  inquirers,  in which case it still would be a good idea for them to read both Part I and Part II, and in the latter, simply substitute a ' helper of any kind'for the word teacher. And teachers can use the book alone as a resource for designing strate­ gies  for  helping  their  students  learn  how  to  take  more responsibility for their own learning.

In  any case,  you  will  soon  discover  that this  is  not  a book to be read and reacted to. It is a resource for you to use as  a self-directed learner, whether you  are  a student or a teacher.

Make it  work for you!

## PART  I THE  LEARNER

## For the Learner

Welcome to an adventure in self-directed learning. I'  like d to start off by setting a climate for our mutual inquiry.

## Setting a Climate

First, I'  like it to be a warm climate. I'  like for you to d d feel that I care about you, even though I don'  know you. t At least you know that I care enough to take quite a bit of time to figure out how, without being able to see you, I can help you become a self-directed learner. I hope that you will feel warmly toward me, too, as you get to know me better through what I say.

Second,  I' like it to be  a climate  of mutual  respect. d I respect you for being interested enough in becoming a more self-directed learner to be willing to read this book. And I respect the experience and creativity you bring to this inquiry that will enable you to mold the ideas and sug­ gestions in this book to your own needs and style. I hope you' l respect me for attempting something I have never l done before- trying to help people become self-directed learners  through  the  printed  word.

Third, I'  like it to be a climate conducive to dialogue. d I' like you to feel free to participate actively in  this  in­ d quiry, both by raising questions about what I say and sup­ plying  your  own  answers,  and  by  following  your  own curiosities wherever they lead you. I would feel especially good if you are engaging in this inquiry along with others, with whom you can share the dialogue face to face.

Fourth, I'  like it to be a climate in which we are clear d about, and secure in, our respective roles. I see my role to be that of a guide for, and facilitator of, your inquiry, as well as being a source of information about facts, ideas, and other forms  of help.  I  shall  try  to  be  as  skillful  as possible in suggesting procedures for you to use in your inquiry,  and I hope that these will not come through  to you as impositions of my will on yours. Instead, I see your role as being an active inquirer and wanting to learn  all you can from the resources  I can provide- but on your terms, at your speed, and in your own style. I see you as accepting  or  rejecting  ideas  because  they  do  or  do  not have meaning to you and not because I or someone else says  you  should.  I  hope  you  feel  secure  in  taking  this degree of responsibility,  and I'  give you all the support ll I can.

Fifth and finally, I'  like to set a climate of mutual trust. d Perhaps the most important condition for your being able to trust me is that I should be open and honest with you about my motives  and  biases.  Regarding  my  motives,  I have been so impressed with the joy that most of my stu­ dents have found in self-directed learning (and the results they have achieved!) that I want to spread the gospel. My motives are the motives of a missionary- so beware,  I' l l try to convert you. And therein lies also my main bias- at least the main bias that I am aware of:  I think that selfdirected learning is the best way  to learn.  I acknowledge

that there are situations in which teaching, instruction, and even  indoctrination  are  called  for.  But I  also  think  that every act of teaching should have built into it some pro­ vision for helping the learner become more self-directing. I recognize that there are situations in which a person is indeed dependent in some respects, and that in these situ­ ations  it  is  appropriate  for  him  or  her  to  be  taught  or directed.  But  I  don'   think  that  it  is  healthy- or  even t humane-for a person to be kept permanently dependent upon a system or upon  another person.  I hope that this confession of my motives and biases will help you to trust me. As for my trusting you, I have faith that you will enter into  this  inquiry  with  an  open  mind,  and  that  you  will seriously consider the concepts and suggestions. But I also have faith that you will test them against your own value system, personality style,  and  experience,  and will either reject or adapt those that don'  stack up. t

## Diagnosing Needs for Learning

Presumably,  since  you  are  reading  this  little  book,  you have become aware of a general need to at least find out something about self-directed learning. I can imagine that this might be true if you have recently had a belittling ex­ perience with  an  arrogant  teacher  or  even  a  frustrating experience with a sloppy and disorganized teacher; or if you  have  entered  into  one  of  the  nontraditional  study programs that are flourishing around the country and have found  yourself  given  more  responsibility  for  your  own learning than you were prepared for; or if you started out to learn something by yourself and fell flat on your face; or if you read somewhere that it is the 'ew thing,'and n simply became curious about what it'  all about. Inquiry s Project No.  1  is designed to investigate this basic need or

curiosity further and to deepen your understanding of why self-directed learning may be important to you.

If this notion intrigues you, you might wish to turn to Inquiry Project No. 1  right now; if not, put it on the back burner to be looked at later if it becomes interesting.

In either case, it probably would be helpful for you to diagnose your needs to learn about self-directed learning at a more specific level. Inquiry Project No. 2 presents a definition  of  self-directed  learning  and  the  assumptions on which it is based.  Inquiry  Project  No.  3   presents  an overview of the competencies required to do it, thus pro­ viding a possible model for you to compare  yourself to. You will want to test this model to determine what aspects of it make sense to you. Then I think you will find it useful to  assess which of these  aspects  of  the  model you  need to  work  on  further- that  is,  which  competencies  need strengthening  in  order  for  you  to  become  a  more  self­ directing learner.  Learning Resource B will help  you do this. I suggest that at this point you might experiment with filling out  the  first  column,  ' earning  Objectives,'of  a L learning contract  as  illustrated  in  Learning  Resource  C. In  this  column  you  should  list  the  learning  objectives (about  self-directed  learning)  that  have  emerged  from Inquiry Project No.  3 .

## Designing a Learning Plan

You are now ready to tackle Inquiry Project No. 4, which suggests strategies and resources for improving your com­ petencies  in  self-directed  learning.  You  can  fill  out  col­ umns 2, 3, and 4 of the learning contract as you engage in Inquiry Project No. 4.

Executing the learning activities is really Inquiry Project No. 5, but it is not in the book, since it consists of what-

ever your learning contract specifies, along with whatever help from teachers, other resource experts, and peers that it calls for. Evaluating your learning, which is the conclud­ ing phase of the self-directed learning process, is provided for in your learning contract.

Happy adventuring.

## Inquiry Project No. 1 :

## Why Self-Directed Learning?

It is a tragic fact that most of us  only know  how to be taught; we haven'  learned  how  to  learn.  Why is  this  a t tragic  fact? There  are  both  immediate  and  long-run reasons.

One immediate reason is that there is convincing evi­ dence that people who take the initiative in learning (pro­ active learners)  learn more things,  and learn better, than do people who sit at the feet of teachers passively waiting to be taught  (reactive learners).  (For definitions of pro­ active  and  reactive  learners,  see  Learning  Resource  L.) They  enter  into  learning  more  purposefully  and  with greater motivation. They also tend to retain and make use of what they learn better and longer than do the reactive learners.

A second immediate reason is that self-directed learning is more in tune with our natural processes of psychological development. When we are bom we are totally dependent personalities.  We  need  parents  to  protect  us,  feed  us, carry us, and make decisions for us. But as we grow and mature  we  develop  an  increasingly  deep  psychological need  to  be  independent,  first,  of  parental  control,  and

then,  later,  of  control  by  teachers  and  other  adults.  An essential  aspect  of  maturing  is  developing  the  ability  to take  increasing  responsibility  for  our  own  lives- to  be­ come  increasingly  self-directing.

A third immediate reason is that many of the new de­ velopments in education- the new curriculums, open classrooms, nongraded schools, learning resource centers, independent study, nontraditional study programs,  exter­ nal  degree  programs,  universities-without-walls,  and  the like- put a heavy responsibility on the learners to take a good  deal  of  initiative  in  their  own  learning.  Students entering into  these programs without having learned  the skills of self-directed inquiry will experience anxiety, frus­ tration, and often failure, and so will their teachers.  The rapid  spread  of  this  problem  in  high  schools,  technical institutes,  community  colleges,  colleges  and  universities, and adult education is precisely what has caused this book to  be  written.

But there is also a long-run reason why it is tragic that we have not learned how to learn without being taught, and it is probably more important than all of the immedi­ ate  reasons  put  together.  Alvin  Toffler  calls  this  reason ' future  shock.'The simple truth is that we are  entering into  a strange new  world  in which  rapid  change  will  be the  only  stable  characteristic.  And  this  simple  truth  has several radical implications for education and learning.

For one thing, this implies that it is no longer realistic to define the purpose of education as transmitting what is known.  In  a world  in  which  the half-life  of  many  facts (and skills) may be ten years or less, half of what a person has acquired at the age of twenty may be obsolete by the time that person is thirty. Thus, the main purpose of edu­ cation must now be to develop the skills of inquiry. When a person leaves schooling he or she must not only have a

foundation of knowledge acquired in the course of learn­ ing to inquire but, more importantly, also have the ability to  go  on  acquiring  new  knowledge  easily  and  skillfully the rest of his or her life.

A second implication is that there must be a somewhat different  way  of  thinking  about  learning.  Typically,  we think  of  learning  as  what  takes  place  in  school- it  is ' being taught.'To be adequate for our strange new world we must come to think of learning as being the same as living.  We  must learn from  everything  we  do;  we  must exploit every experience as a ' earning experience.'Every l institution in our community- government agency, store, recreational organization, church- becomes a resource for learning, as does every person we have access to- parent, child,  friend, service  provider, doctor, teacher,  fellow worker, supervisor,  minister,  store  clerk,  and  so  on  and on. Learning means making use of every resource- in or out of educational  institutions- for  our  personal  growth and  development.

A third implication is that it is no longer  appropriate to equate education with youth. In the civilization of our forefathers it may have been possible for people to learn in their youthful years most of what they would need to know for the rest of their life, but this is no longer true. Education- or,  even  better,  learning- must  now  be  de­ fined  as  a  lifelong process.  The  primary  learning  during youth will be the skills of inquiry  and the learning  after schooling is done will be focused on acquiring the knowl­ edge,  skills, understanding,  attitude,  and  values  required for living adequately in a rapidly changing world.

To sum up:  the ' why'of self-directed learning is sur­ vival-your own survival  as  an  individual,  and  also  the survival of  the  human  race.  Clearly,  we  are  not  talking here  about  something  that  would  be  nice  or  desirable;

neither are we talking  about  some new  educational fad. We  are  talking  about  a  basic  human  competence- the ability to learn on one'  own- that has suddenly become s a  prerequisite  for  living  in  this  new  world.

## Inquiry Project No. 2 :

## What is Self-Directed Learning?

In its broadest meaning, ' self-directed learning'describes a process in which individuals take the initiative, with or without  the  help  of  others,  in  diagnosing  their  learning needs, formulating learning goals, identifying human  and material resources for learning,  choosing and  implement­ ing appropriate learning strategies, and evaluating learning outcomes. Other labels found in the literature to describe this process are 'elf-planned learning,'' nquiry method,' s i ' independent learning,' ' self-education,' ' self-instruc­ tion,' ' self-teaching,' ' self-study,' and ' autonomous learning.'The  trouble  with most  of these labels  is  that they  seem  to  imply  learning  in  isolation,  whereas  selfdirected  learning usually  takes  place  in  association  with various kinds of helpers, such as teachers, tutors, mentors, resource people,  and  peers.  There  is  a  lot  of  mutuality among a group of self-directed learners.

## TWO APPROACHES TO  EDUCATION

Perhaps the full meaning of self-directed  learning can be made clearer by comparing it with its opposite, which

was referred to in Inquiry Project No. 1  as being ' taught.' To make the labels parallel, let'  call it 'eacher-directed s t learning.'

It might be worthwhile to mention in passing that the body  of theory  and  practice  on  which  teacher-directed learning is based is often given the label 'edagogy,'from p the  Greek  words  paid  (meaning  ' child' ) and  agogus (meaning  ' leader' ).  Pedagogy  has  come  to  be  defined as the  art and science of teaching,  but its  tradition is in the teaching of children. The body of theory and practice on which self-directed learning is based has come  to  be labeled  ' andragogy,'from  the  combining  form  andr  of the  Greek  word  aner  (meaning  ' man' ).  Andragogy  is defined, therefore, as the art and science of helping adults (or,  even  better,  maturing  human  beings)  learn.  These definitions  do  not  imply  that  children  should  be  taught pedagogically and adults should be taught andragogically. Rather,  the  two  terms  simply  differentiate  between  two sets of assumptions  about learners,  and the  teacher who makes  one  set  of  assumptions  will  teach  pedagogically whether he or she is teaching children or adults, whereas the teacher who makes the other set of assumptions will teach andragogically whether the learners are children or adults. In fact, many of the current innovations in school­ ing, such as open classrooms, nongraded schools, learning laboratories, community schools, and nontraditional study programs, are premised  on andragogical assumptions about children and youth as learners.

The  assumptions  about  learners  on  which  these  two approaches  are  based  are  summarized  in  Learning  Re­ source  A.  You  might  find  it  helpful  to  scan  it  quickly now,  and then turn  back here  and  read  the  paragraphs below for any further explanation you may want.

Teacher-directed learning assumes the learner is essen-

tially a dependent personality and that the teacher has the responsibility of deciding what and how the learner should be taught; whereas self-directed learning assumes that the human being grows in  capacity  (and  need)  to  be  self­ directing as an essential component of maturing, and that this capacity should be nurtured to develop as rapidly as possible.

Teacher-directed  learning  assumes  that  the  learner' s experience is of less  value  than  that  of  the  teacher,  the textbook writers and materials producers as a resource for learning, and that therefore the teacher has the responsi­ bility to  see  to it that the resources  of these  experts  are transmitted to the learner; whereas  self-directed  learning assumes that the learner'  experiences become an increas­ s ingly rich resource for learning which should be exploited along with the resources  of experts.

Teacher-directed learning assumes that students become ready to learn different things at different levels of matura­ tion,  and  that  a  given  set  of  learners  will  therefore  be ready to learn the same things at a given level of matura­ tion; whereas self-directed learning  assumes that individ­ uals  become ready to learn what is required  to  perform their evolving life tasks or to cope more adequately with their life problems, and that each individual therefore has a somewhat different pattern of readiness from other indi­ viduals.

Teacher-directed  learning  assumes  that  students  enter into education with a subject-centered orientation to learn­ ing  (they  see  learning  as  accumulating  subject  matter) and  that  therefore  learning  experiences  should  be  orga­ nized according to units of content; whereas self-directed learning  assumes that this orientation is  a  result of their previous  conditioning  in  school  and  that  their  natural orientation  is  task-  or  problem-centered,  and  that  there-

fore  learning  experiences  should  be  organized  as  taskaccomplishing  or  problem-solving  learning  projects  (or inquiry  units).

Teacher-directed  learning  assumes  that  students  are motivated  to  learn  in  response  to  external  rewards  and punishments, such  as grades,  diplomas,  awards,  degrees, and fear of failure; whereas self-directed learning assumes that learners are motivated by internal incentives, such as the need for esteem (especially self-esteem), the desire to achieve, the urge to grow, the satisfaction of accomplish­ ment, the need to know something specific, and curiosity.

As you reflect on  these  differing  assumptions,  does  it occur to you that both sets of assumptions may be truethat  all  teacher-directed  learning  is  not  necessarily  bad and that all self-directed learning is not necessarily good? No doubt there  are learning  situations  in  which  we  are indeed dependent  (as when approaching an entirely new and strange area of inquiry), in which our experience is in fact of little worth  (as when we have had no previous experience within the area of inquiry), in which our readi­ ness to learn is really determined by our level of matura­ tion regarding the area of inquiry, in which we are rightly focusing on accumulating subject matter, and in which we are actually motivated by external pressures. Perhaps what makes the difference between pedagogical and andragogical education is not so much the difference in the assump­ tions  underlying  their  theory  and  practice  as  it  is  the attitude of the learners. If self-directed learners recognize that  there  are  occasions  on  which  they  will  need  to  be taught, they will enter into those taught-learning situations in  a  searching,  probing  frame  of  mind  and  will  exploit them  as resources  for  learning  without  losing  their  selfdirectedness.

## Inquiry Project No. 3 : What Competencies Are Required for Self-Directed Learning?

The  competencies  required  to  excel  in  teacher-directed learning, every ^-student will tell you, include the ability to listen attentively, the ability to take careful notes, the abil­ ity to read speedily and with good comprehension, and the ability to predict exam questions and cram for them. This may seem to be a caricature of teacher-directed learning competencies, but aren'  these in reality the ones we have t come to rely upon in school?

Self-directed learning, however, requires a very different set of competencies.  A list of the more general  and im­ portant competencies are contained  in Learning  Re­ source B.

You might find it useful to turn to Learning Resource B now and rate the degree to which you already possess each of these competencies. Then check out your ratings with a group of two or three peers  and a teacher to get their  help  in  testing  how  realistic  your  ratings  are.

## Inquiry Project No. 4:

## Designing a Learning Plan

There are a variety of ways one can go  about designing a plan for learning. Perhaps the simplest is to follow the steps of scientific inquiry:

- 1.  What is the question I want an answer to?
- 2.  What are the data I need to answer this question?
- 3.  What are the most appropriate and feasible sources of these data?
- 4.  What  are  the most  efficient  and  effective  means  I can use to collect these data from these sources?
- 5.  How shall I organize and analyze these data to get an answer to my question?
- 6.  How will I report my answer and test its validity?

But I want to suggest a somewhat more elaborate and rigorous format:  a learning contract.  My students report that it helps them organize their learning more efficiently, induces them to be more creative in identifying learning resources  and  developing  learning  strategies,  and  forces them to get better evidence of their accomplishments. It is capable  of  being  used  in  any  content  area.

## THE LEARNING CONTRACT

A contract is usually defined as  ' a  binding agreement between two or more persons or parties,'and it is in fact becoming more and more common for teachers to make contracts with students for course work and grades,  and for  nontraditional  study  institutions  to  enter  into  con­ tracts with students specifying what must be accomplished to earn a particular degree. For the purpose of this learn­ ing  project  in  self-directed  learning,  however,  I  suggest that you contract with yourself. You are contracting with yourself to become a self-directed learner, and your con­ tract will specify how you will go about it and how you will know when you are there.

Here  are  some  suggestions  for  building  your  learning contract:

- 1.  Turn  to  Learning  Resource  C  and  reproduce  on three or four sheets of typing paper the four-column form of the contract  (1. Learning Objectives; 2. Learning Re­ sources  and Strategies;  3 .  Evidence  of Accomplishment; and 4. Criteria and Means of Validating).
- 2.  Scan  down  Column  1   of  the  sample  contract  in Learning Resource C and, on the basis of the assessment you made in Inquiry Project No.  3, write into Column  1 of your contract form any objectives that you feel it would be useful for you to work toward. Add any other objec­ tives not in this list that you can think of on your own.
- 3.  Go now to Column 2 of your contract form and for each learning objective identify one or more learning re­ sources and strategies that you think will help you accom­ plish that objective. Learning Resources J and K describe some learning strategies that are relevant to various kinds of objectives; you may well think of others.

- 4.  Now you are ready for Column 3, in which for each objective you specify what evidence you will collect to help you measure the degree to which you have accomplished that  objective.  Learning  Resource  C  and  Learning  Re­ source N will give you  some ideas  about what kinds  of evidence are appropriate for different objectives.  You, in turn, may think of other kinds of evidence that will have meaning for you.
- 5.  Column 4 provides space for you to indicate what criteria you will use for judging the evidence,  and what means you will use  to  convince  yourself  of  the  validity of the evidence. Learning Resource O may suggest ideas for this step. This is probably the most difficult part of the whole  process,  so  don'   try  to  be  too  ambitious  about t being scientific. The important thing is that you have some experience in weighing the evidence about what you have learned and judging how convincing it is  to you.
- 6.  At this point, you will find it helpful to  check  out your learning contract with a teacher or a group of peers. You can ask  them  such questions  as:
- a.  Are  the  learning  objectives  clear,  understand­ able, and realistic?
- b.  Can  they  think  of  other  objectives  you  might consider?
- c.  Do the learning strategies seem reasonable?
- d.  Can they think of other resources and strategies you might consider?
- e.  Does the evidence seem relevant to the various objectives?
- f. Can  they  suggest  other  evidence  you  might consider?
- g.  Are  the  criteria  and  means  for  validating  the evidence  clear,  relevant,  and  convincing?

- h. Can  they think  of  other  ways  to  validate  the evidence  you  might  consider?
- 7. From  the  responses  you  get  from  the  above  con­ sultants, you may wish to modify your contract.

Now you are ready to engage in the learning strategies specified in your contract.

Have a rewarding experience.

## PART  II THE  TEACHER

## For the Teacher

Welcome to an adventure in turning students on to learn­ ing. I'  like to start off with you, as I did with the learners, d by setting a climate for our mutual inquiry. So I suggest that if you haven'  already read what I said to the learners t in  Part  I,  you  turn  there  now  and  scan  it.  I'   like  for d the same social climate to exist in our relationship that I set up for them:  warm, mutually respectful, dialogic, and mutually  trustful.

## Setting a Climate

The nature of the inquiry you and I will be engaging in is somewhat different from the inquiry the learners and I engaged in.  The objective  of my inquiry  with  them  was to help them learn to become  self-directed learners.  The nature of my inquiry with you will be to explore the impli­ cations  for  teachers  of  having  self-directed  learners  as students. The broad question we shall inquire into is this: ' What should be my role, what competencies will I need.

and  what  strategies  should  I  use  if  I  am  to  teach  selfdirected learners?'

In order to minimize any temptation on my part to take a didactic cook-book stance,  let me open up the inquiry by presenting myself as a case study.

## Defining a New Role

## From Content Transmitter .  .  .

When I first started experimenting at encouraging students to  be  self-directed  learners,  I  experienced  a  severe  dis­ sonance  in the  conception  of  my  own  role.  I  had  been trained to perceive my role as essentially that of contenttransmitter  and  judge  of the  students'absorption  of the transmitted content. Accordingly, in performing this role, I saw my main function as preparing and executing a con­ tent plan, which involved my answering only the follow­ ing four questions:

- 1.  What content needs to be covered? So  I  would  list  all  the  concepts,  principles,  facts, and skills that should be covered in a given course. I  might  add  that  my  conditioning  had  been  such that I thought in terms of what should be covered,
- not what should be learned.
- 2.  How can this content be organized into manageable units?

So I would arrange the content into one-hour units, three-hour  units,  one-semester  units,  or  whatever other size of units the schedule required.

- 3.  How can these units be organized into a logical se­ quence?

So I would  try  to  figure  out  the  inherent logic  of whatever subject matter content I was teaching. If it was  historical  information,  the  sequence  from  an­ cient to modem seemed obvious- although I  later learned that the way we actually gain historical per­ spective is the reverse of that. If it was skill-develop­ ment  content,  movement  from  simple  to  complex skills was  the  sequence  of choice- even though,  if I had thought about it,  I would  have  remembered that I learned to swim by learning the more complex skill of staying afloat first and then later learned the simpler  skill of flutter-kicking.

4.  What means of  transmission  will  be  most  efficient for  transmitting each  unit? So I would decide which unit would be transmitted by  lecture,  which  by  assigned  reading,  which  by audio-visual presentation,  and so forth.

Then,  of course,  I  would  have  to  administer  tests  to find  out  how  much  of the  content  the  students  had  re­ ceived and absorbed. And when the test results were less than  satisfactory,  I  naturally  assumed  that  the  fault  lay with the students' reception, and not with my transmission.

I must admit, in retrospect, that I think I was a pretty good transmitter. My content was well organized, with a good  logical  outline;  I  illustrated  abstract  concepts  or principles with interesting examples;  I spoke clearly  and dynamically; I brought  forth  frequent  chuckles  with  my humor; I invited interruptions for questions of clarification at  any  time;  and  I  had  lively  discussions  and  practice exercises  following  my  lectures  when  there  was  time.  I

think my tests were quite fair, too- always  producing a pretty good curve of distribution.

When I started encouraging students to be self-directed learners,  I initially assumed that they would  change  but I would perform the same. The only difference would be that they would take more responsibility for making use of my transmissions, planning their outside reading,  and producing more creative term papers. I had a couple of early shocks as a result of this assumption. The first was when I discovered that my students didn'  want to be selft directed learners;  they wanted  me  to  teach  them.  Then, when I  got them  over that  hurdle- through  strategies  I shall  describe  shortly- they  really  got  turned  on  about being self-directed learners  and forced me to change my role.

Rather than bore you with the long process this transi­ tion involved, let me describe how I see my role as it has evolved up to this point  (and I hope it will continue to evolve  as  my  students  help  me  to  learn  how  to  do  it better).

## ... To Facilitator of Learning

In  the  first  place,  my  self-concept  has  changed  from that of teacher to that of facilitator of learning. This may seem to be a simple and perhaps even superficial change. But I found it to be fundamental and terribly difficult.  It required that I focus on what was happening in the stu­ dents rather than on what I was  doing.  It required that I  divest  myself  of  the  protective  shield  of  an  authority figure  and  expose  myself  as  me- an  authentic  human being, with feelings,  hopes,  aspirations, insecurities,  wor­ ries, strengths, and weaknesses. It required that I be clear about precisely what  resources  I  did  and  did  not  have

that might be useful to the learners, and that I make the resources I did have accessible to them on their terms. It required that  I  extricate  myself  from  the  compulsion  to pose as an expert who had mastered any given body of content and, instead, join my students honestly as a con­ tinuing co-learner.

In  the  second place,  I  have  found  myself  performing quite  a different  set of functions  from those  involved  in transmitting  (although I still do  some transmitting when the  self-directed learners  ask  for  it),  and  that  therefore I have had to develop a different set of skills. I found my­ self,  for  example,  functioning  primarily  as  a  procedural guide and only secondarily as a resource for content in­ formation. To clarify the concept ' procedural guide,'let me compare the questions I now ask in preparing an edu­ cational program with the  questions  I  listed  earlier  that I asked when I thought of myself as a content transmitter. I ask myself, ' What procedures shall I use (or present to the learners as options) that are likely to be most effective with this particular group  of  learners,  in  this  particular setting, given this particular area of inquiry,  for accom­ plishing the following seven  elements  of  an  andragogical process design?'

## 1.  Climate setting.

How can I most quickly get the learners to become acquainted with one another as persons and as mu­ tual resources for learning? How can I help them to gain an understanding of the concept of self-directed learning?  How can  I  provide  them  with  a  simple preliminary experience in practising the skills of selfdirected learning? How can I help them  to under­ stand  my  role  as  a  facilitator  and  resource  to self-directed learners  and ensure that they will feel

comfortable in relating to me this way? How can I present myself to  them  as  a  human  being  so  that they may trust me? How can I provide them with a short but meaningful experience in working together collaboratively?  How  can  I  create  an  atmosphere characterized  by  both  mutual  caring  and  support and  intellectual  rigor?

## 2.  Planning.

At what points  shall  I  decide  what  procedures  to use, and at what points shall I present optional pro­ cedures for them to decide about? On what ethical basis shall I make this decision, and how will I ex­ plain  it  to  them  and  invite  their  modification  or veto? What mechanism will I propose for involving them in the decision-making process- consensus or voting by the total group, delegation of responsibility to  subgroups,  or  delegation  to  an  elected  steering committee?

## 3.  Diagnosing needs for learning.

How shall we construct a model of the competencies (or content objectives, if you prefer)  this particular learning experience should be concerned with? If I start with  a  model  I  have  constructed,  how  can  I present it so that they will feel free to change it or build upon it? If I start with their suggestions for a model,  how  can  I  introduce  my  own  ideas  or  the requirements  from  the  outer  environment  without denigrating  their  contributions?  How  can  I  assure that they will have a sense of ownership of the model finally agreed upon? How can I make it possible for them realistically and nonthreateningly to assess the gaps between their present level of development of the competencies and the level required by the model?

## 4.  Setting goals.

How can I help them translate diagnosed needs into learning  objectives  that  are  clear,  feasible,  at  ap­ propriate levels  of specificity  or generality,  person­ ally  meaningful,  and  measurable  as  to  accomplish­ ment? How can I suggest changes constructively?

## 5.  Designing a learning plan.

What guidelines  for  designing  a  learning  plan  will I  propose?  What  optional  models  of  plans  will  I present?  What kinds  of help  will  I  give  particular learners in designing their plans? How will I expose them to resources and strategies for using resources that  they  may  not  know  about  or  may  not  have thought  of?  What  mechanisms (e.g. , consultation teams)  can I suggest to facilitate their helping one another in  designing  their  plans?

## 6.  Engaging  in  learning  activities.

Which learning  activities  shall  I  take  responsibility for to meet objectives  that  are  common  to  all  (or most) of their learning plans, which activities should be the responsibility of subgroups, and which should be  individual  inquiry  projects?  How  can  I  make myself  available  to  subgroups  and  individuals  as a  consultant  and  resource  as  they  plan  and  carry out  their learning  activities?  What  is  my  responsi­ bility for assuring quality performance of the learn­ ing  activities?

## 7.  Evaluating learning outcomes.

What  should  be  my  role  in  feeding  data  to  the learners regarding my perceptions of the accomplish­ ment of their learning objectives? How can I do it so as not to create a dissonance with the learners' self-

directedness? What is my responsibility for making judgments  about  the  adequacy  of  the  evidence  of accomplishment of the learners'objectives  and  the adequacy of their criteria  and means for validating their evidence? How can I present these judgments in  such  a  way  that  they  will  enhance  rather  than diminish  the learners' self-concepts  as  self-directed persons?

I  have  encountered  several  conceptual  problems  in presenting  this  new  role  to  learners  that  it  is  probably appropriate  to  discuss  now,  before  getting  into  some  of the more technical problems in the next section.

One problem concerns the issue of structure versus non­ structure. Many students enter into a new learning situa­ tion feeling a deep need for the security of a clear struc­ tural plan- an outline, course syllabus, time schedule, and the  like.  They  want  teachers  who  know  what  they  are doing,  who  are in  charge.  When  they  first  hear  me  de­ scribe my perception of the role of a facilitator and re­ source  to  self-directed  learners  it  seems  so  structureless to them that they become anxious.  So I have learned to emphasize that we shall be working within a structure, but that it is a different kind of structure from what they have been used to- that it is a process structure; whereas they have been used to a content structure. And I assure them that I am in charge of the process, that I shall make de­ cisions about procedures when they aren'  in a position to t make them with me, and that I know what I am doing. I assure them that I understand that they are being asked to take more responsibility for learning than they are used to, and that I shall help them learn to do it.

This raises a second problem, which concerns the issue of  ' content'versus  'o  content.'   Students  want  to  be n

sure  that  they  are  going  to  get  the  required  content  to pass their exams, get certified, obtain licenses, get accepted into other institutions, or get jobs. I deal with this problem head-on by explaining that the  difference between a con­ tent-transmission plan and a process design is not that one deals with content and the other does not, but that one is concerned with the transmission of content and the other with the acquisition of content. I refer them to the  chart in Learning Resource A and point out that as a result of going through the first four phases of the process design on the right half of the chart  (climate setting, planning, diag­ nosing needs, and setting goals)  we  arrive at a clear defi­ nition of the content they are to acquire.

A third problem, which arises only in institutional set­ tings in which grades are required, is how the grades will be arrived  at fairly.  I deal with this  problem by  inviting the  students  to  draft  contracts  in  which  they  specify  on separate sheets what objectives they propose fulfilling for a C,  a B,  and  an A.  I study these first drafts very  care­ fully and frequently write my detailed reactions indicating what revisions  will  have  to  be  made  in  the  contracts  in order for me to find them acceptable at the levels of grade specified.  Only  when  a  contract  is  revised  to  the  point where it calls for a level of performance that I feel repre­ sents A quality will I agree to a contract for an A. I must confess that this system puts a lot of pressure  on students in  a  competitive  academic  environment  to  overextend themselves, and I frequently find myself encouraging stu­ dents to contract for a B or C rather than to sacrifice their health  or possible  achievement in  other  courses.  On  the other hand,  it  has  been  my  experience  that  this  system produces a high degree of motivation along with an output of energy that results in superior learning.

## Developing Self-Directed Learners

As I see it, the first responsibility of a facilitator of learn­ ing is to help students develop competence as self-directed learners. I can visualize four optional strategies you might use for doing this:

- 1. You could ask the students individually (preferably, I should think, before classes start)  to turn to Part I of this book and engage in Inquiry Projects 1 , 2, 3, and 4 on their  own- coming  to  you  only  when  they  want  help. Then,  at the opening session of the  first  class you  have with them, you could have them analyze their experience and raise unresolved issues or unanswered questions.
- 2.  You could  team the students up into  small  groups of from two to five and  ask them to pursue the Inquiry Projects  independently  as  teams- coming  to  you  only when they need help, and also having them analyze their experience in the first session of class.
- 3.  You could involve all of a given group of students (for instance, all the entering freshmen, or all the students in a given department, or all the students for whom you are the adviser, or all the students you will have in your courses) in an intensive two-day workshop on self-directed

learning.  One  model  of  a  design  for  such  a  workshop, which is based on the assumption that all the students will have a copy of this book, is  as follows:

- a.  Climate  setting:
- (1)  Presentation of your perception of the pur­ pose  of  this  workshop  and  of your- and their- role in  it.
- (2)  Relationship-building exercise. (Learning Resource E.)
- (3)  Why self-directed learning?  (Inquiry  Proj­ ect 1, followed  by  discussion  of  agree­ ments,  disagreements,  questions,  and  sug­ gestions for further inquiry.)
- (4)  What  is  self-directed  learning? (Inquiry Project 2, followed by a discussion of the assumptions and  process elements pre­ sented in Learning Resource A.)
- b.  Diagnosis  of  needs  for  learning  (about  selfdirected  learning):
- (1)  What competencies  are required?  (Inquiry Project  3.)
- (2)  Rating by each student of his or her present level of competencies.  (Learning Resource B,  with  students  sharing  their  self-ratings in  consultation  groups  of  from  three  to five.)
- c.  Designing a learning plan  (Inquiry Project 4):
- (1)  Have each student make out a first draft of a  learning  contract,  using  the  model  in Learning  Resource  C.
- (2)  Have each student present his or her con­ tract  to  the  above  consultation  group  of peers and get their suggestions for improve­ ment.

- (3)  Collect the revised contracts and, while the students have free time, add your own sug­ gestions to each contract.
- (4)  Return  the  contracts  to  the  students  and give  them  time  to  make  revisions  in  the light  of  your  suggestions.
- d.  Conducting  learning  activities:
- (1)  The students could be given the choice of working on the learning strategies specified in  their  contracts  either  individually  or  in self-selected  inquiry  groups.
- (2)  Your  role  would  be  to  be  available  as  a consultant and resource person as specified in  the  Inquiry  Projects  or  Learning  Re­ sources.
- e.  Evaluating learning outcomes:
- (1)  Have  each  student  present  the  evidence specified in his ox her contract to the con­ sultation  group  constituted  above  in  b.
- (2)  Invite  a  sample  of students  to  share  their contracts and  evidences with the total group, with you reacting and drawing gen­ eralizations.
- (3)  Have the students form new groups of five or six  each  and  evaluate  the  total  experi­ ence, with feedback to you by a designated spokesman  for  each  group.
- 4. If  copies  of  this  book  will  not  be  available  to  all the  students,  you  could  provide  them  with  at  least  an introductory orientation to the concept and skills of selfdirected learning through the following three-hour design which I developed for our entering degree candidates:

All  new  students  are  invited  to  attend  a  three-hour orientation session during the week before classes start or, if this isn'  feasible, the opening week of the term, with a t

choice among two or three time periods. Each student is asked to bring an information-resource book (not a novel or creative essay), preferably with its dust jacket still on it, and with a table of contents and index. The students sit in  groups  of  five  or  six,  around  tables  or  in  circles  of chairs, as they enter the room.

In opening the session, I  (or perhaps  I may call on a veteran student to do this)  explain that they are entering a program in which they will be expected to take a good deal of responsibility  and initiative in their learning,  and that the purpose of this orientation session is to acquaint them with the concept and to give them some skill practice in  self-directed  learning.  I  then  explain  that  the  design for the session consists of four activities:  (a) development of a cognitive map;  (b)  a relationship-building  exercise; (c)  a proactive reading exercise,  and  (d)  an exercise in utilization  of  peer  resources.  These  activities are  con­ ducted  as  follows:

- a.  Development  of  a  cognitive  map:
- (1 )   Pass  out  reproductions  of  the  chart,  ' A Comparison of Assumptions and Processes of Transmitted Learning and Self-Directed Learning'   which  is  displayed  in  Learning Resource A.
- (2 )   Ask  the  students  to  examine  the  left  half of  the  chart (' Assumptions' ) and  raise any questions that will  tend  to  help  them understand what it means.  (I will respond only  after  inviting  other  students  to  re­ spond first.)
- (3)  Then ask the students to examine the right half  of  the  chart (' Process  Elements' ) and  similarly raise  questions  for  clarifi­ cation.

- (4)  Pass out reproductions of the chart, ' om­ C petencies  of  Self-directed  Learning,' dis­ played in Learning Resource B, and invite the students to raise questions of clarifica­ tion, and then to rate themselves.  (I have found  that  students  find  it  supportive  if they  share  their  self-ratings  in  their  small groups.)
- b.  Relationship-building  exercise (Learning  Re­ source E).
- c.  Using material resources proactively  (Learning Resource L).
- d.  Using  human  resources  proactively  (Learning Resource M).
- e.  Analyzing  this  experience:
- (1)  Engage  the  students  in  learning  through the  analysis  of their  experience  by  asking such questions as:
- (a)  How differently do you feel about your fellow students from the way you usu­ ally do in  a  class?
- (b)  How  do you  feel  about  being  a  selfdirected learner?
- (c)  In  what regards  do  you  feel  need  for help  in  becoming  more  self-directed as a learner, and how will you go about getting this help?

## Implementing the Role of Facilitator

I am now going to undertake a very risky venture. I am going to describe how I go about performing as  a facili­ tator and resource  to self-directed  learners  in  a contentoriented course.

One risk is that the content of the course I am going to be using for illustration will be so different from the con­ tent of the courses you teach that you may be tempted to write  off  the  illustration  as  irrelevant  to  your  situation. This it may be, but, on the other hand, I have used this same approach in a number of content areas having to do with professional development, and my students have used it in courses ranging from liberal arts  to highly technical subjects, with  a variety of adaptations,  and it has  almost universally seemed to produce more enthusiastic  and  ac­ complished learners.

Another risk is that the description of what I do may be interpreted  as  the right way- or best  way- to  do  it. But  I  am  going  to  describe  my  performance  in  a  very narrow,  specialized  content  area:  a  graduate  course  in ' The Nature of Adult Education.'I would  perform the role differently in different content areas  in which  I  was

more  or less  an  expert resource  and  in  which  other  re­ sources were more or less available.  Furthermore, differ­ ent people performing the role in precisely the same situa­ tions  would  perform  it  differently,  adapting  it  to  their individual  personalities,  styles,  and  resources.  So  we  are talking about a basic process that can be implemented in a variety of ways.  I shall be describing only my way,  at this particular stage of my development. Note that I am willing  to  take  these  risks  if  you  are  willing  to  let  me be me.

I  have  offered  the  course,  ' O700:  The  Nature  of E Adult Education,'  for fifteen years, with enrollments rang­ ing from  thirty  to  sixty  students.  The  basic  content  ob­ jectives  and  process  elements  have  been  constant,  but each year I have experimented with differed procedures, so  the  course  has  not been  the  same  twice.  The  course would meet one afternoon  a week, from four o' lock to c seven  o' lock,  for fifteen weeks.  Usually  the  course  was c assigned a room with movable chairs that could easily be arranged five or six chairs to a circle; on a few occasions we had a room with small tables and five or six chairs to a table, which I prefer.

Here is how I have tried to be a facilitator and resource to self-directed learners in this course:

- 1.  FIRST  MEETING. (Orientation, climate setting, and relationship build­

ing.)

As students enter the room I welcome them and intro­ duce myself. I give each student a 5-by-8-inch plain card and a felt pen and ask them to fold the card and write his or her name on it, and then place it  on the arm of the chair or on the table so that everybody can see it.

When it appears that most of the students have arrived,

I introduce myself again and explain that in this course I am making certain assumptions about learning and about mature learners  that  they  should  be  aware  of  and have a chance to react to. I then distribute the chart, '  Com­ A parison of Assumptions and Processes of Teacher-directed Learning and Self-Directed Learning'(Learning Resource A). I  ask  them first to scan the left  side  and  raise  any questions about the assumptions,  and then I ask them to scan the right side and raise any questions they have about the processes. This dialogue may go on for fifteen to thirty minutes, during which time I take the opportunity to elab­ orate on my perception of my role as a facilitator and re­ source and their role  as self-directed learners.

I next explain that as they look at one another in this classroom,  they  see  one  another  as  competitors  because this has been their conditioning from previous schooling, but that the approach we are using in this course requires that they relate to one another as mutual helpers. This is the rationale  for taking  a few  minutes  to  engage  in  the relationship-building  exercise  described  in  Learning  Re­ source E.

I then pass out the course syllabus, which contains the following elements:

## a.  Course objectives.

I explain that these objectives describe the com­ petencies  of  knowledge,  understanding,  skill, attitude, and value that my own experience and some research seem  to  indicate  are  possessed by excellent practitioners  in  the  field  of  adult education  that  are  within  the  scope  of  this course, but that the students should read them critically  and  be  prepared  at  the  next  session to  suggest modifications.

## b.  Resources for  learning.

I review the bibliographical references, pointing out the kind of information contained in each one, and suggest some of the human resources available  among  the  members  of  the  class, among the faculty of the university  (including myself),  and  in  the  community.

## c.  Units of inquiry.

This section of the syllabus proposes the areas of  inquiry (Learning  Resource  H)  that  are appropriate to this course,  and identifies some of the material  and  human resources  that  are especially relevant to each unit.  I review these units,  elaborating  on  their meaning,  and  sug­ gesting why it is useful for  adult educators  to have  competence  in  these  areas.  I  invite  the students, as this review is being done, to suggest other areas they would like to inquire into.

I then pass out reproductions of Learning Resource H and  suggest that during the following week the students scan the resources mentioned in the syllabus and start fist­ ing on the right side of Learning Resource H  the areas they feel the need to inquire into further.

I  close  the  first  session  by  inviting  questions  on  any areas that haven'  been dealt with adequately.  The ques­ t tion most frequently asked at this point is how the grade will be arrived at. To this I suggest that they be thinking about what they would like to propose in this regard for us to discuss at the next session.

## 2.  SECOND  MEETING.

(Diagnosis  of  needs  for  learning  and  formulating objectives.)

I open the second session by reviewing what happened

at the first session and inviting any new students to intro­ duce themselves.

I then explain that during the remainder of the course the students are going to be using one another frequently as  consultants,  and that therefore it might be useful for them to have some practice in using skills of consultation. I describe an exercise designed for this purpose, and  ask for a show of hands as to who would like to do it; so far, the majority of students have raised their hands, but if they hadn' , we would have skipped the exercise (also, I always t leave the option open for those who don'  want to do it to t spend the time at something else).  So the students spon­ taneously form  triads  and  we  do  the  exercise  described in Learning Resource F,  with  the problem each  student presents to his or her consultant being the adequacy of his self-diagnosis  of  learning  needs  as  developed  in  his  use of Learning Resource H.

This  exercise takes  one  hour.  Following  it,  I  call  the class to order and ask if other areas of inquiry have sur­ faced that are not included in the syllabus. In almost every class one or two other areas are suggested, and these are added to the syllabus and to Learning Resource H.

I then suggest that it probably would be useful for us to  get  an  over-all  picture  of the  distribution  of  learning needs among the members of the class. The most efficient technique I have found for accomplishing this  task is to put the students back into groups of five or six, with each group pooling the needs of its members into a frequency distribution,  and  then  building  a  master  frequency  dis­ tribution on the chalk board from the composite reports of all the groups. This process enables each student to iden­ tify what other students  are interested  in the same areas of  inquiry,  and  it  provides  me  with  an  opportunity  to ' make a case'for some areas that seem to be neglected.

Next,  I  explain  that the  task for  the  next  week  is  to construct  first  drafts  of  learning  contracts.  I  pass  out copies of contract forms  containing only the headings  of the form illustrated in Learning  Resource  C,  along with two  or  three  examples  of  completed  contracts  selected from previous students who have taken this course and the ' Guidelines for Contract Learning'reproduced in the Ap­ pendix. I invite and respond to questions about how to fill out each of the four columns in the contract. I explain that a student may contract for a C,  a B,  or  an A,  but  that students contracting for one of the higher grades must in­ dicate on separate sheets what parts of their contracts are for the lower grades.  (Thus,  a student contracting for an A  would have one sheet indicating his A  -level  contract, another sheet indicating his 5-level contract,  and a third sheet showing his C-level contract).  I have found from ex­ perience that this system helps  students to think through what differentiates an excellent level of performance from adequate and passing levels.

I explain that I will collect the first drafts of these con­ tracts at the next session of the class and will return them, along with my comments  and  suggestions,  at  the  begin­ ning of the fourth meeting. I also suggest that during the week the class be thinking about which unit of inquiry, if any, they would like to probe into deeply as a member of an inquiry team.

## 3.  THIRD  MEETING.

(Designing learning plans.)

As soon as all students have arrived I ask them to get into  the  triads  they  formed  the  previous  week  in  doing the consultation skill practice exercise. I explain that these triads  will be  available for  consultation  at  any  time  one member wants help during the remainder of the semester.

I point out that the task now is to test the adequacy of the learning contracts that have been drafted during the week, and I suggest that  this  be  done  by  each  student  taking twenty minutes to present his or her contract and getting feedback from the other two members of the triad. I sug­ gest that the consultants might raise these questions about each contract:

- a.  Concerning the  objectives:
- (1)  Are  they  clear  and  understandable?
- (2) Do they really describe what the individual is  undertaking  to  learn  (rather  than  what he or she plans to do)?
- (3)  Are  they  stated  in  such  a  way  that  the degree to which they are accomplished can be estimated or measured?
- (4) Is  the  differentiation  between  C-level,  fi­ le  vel,  and  A  -level  objectives  reasonable?
- b.  Concerning the learning strategies:
- (1)  Are the resources proposed for each objec­ tive  the  most  authoritative,  reliable, and feasible available?
- (2) Are  there  other  resources- especially  hu­ man resources- that should be considered?
- (3)  Are the methods and techniques proposed for  making use  of the  resources  the  most effective  possible?
- c.  Concerning the evidence of accomplishment of objectives:
- (1)  Is the evidence proposed for each objective clearly  relevant  to  that  objective?
- (2)  Is it the  best  evidence  possible; will it be convincing  to  the  consultants?
- (3)  Can the consultants suggest other kinds of evidence that might be  considered?

- d.  Concerning the criteria and means for validat­ ing the evidence:
- (1)  Are  the  criteria  proposed  for  judging  the evidence of accomplishment of each objec­ tive clear, relevant, and able to be applied?
- (2)  Should  other criteria be  considered?
- (3)  Do the means proposed for judging the evi­ dence  by  these  criteria  seem  appropriate, feasible, and convincing?

(4)  Should other means be considered? (Incidentally, I might point out that these are the ques­ tions I raise when I am consulting with individual students in independent study or degree contracting.)

After the triads have completed reviewing the contracts of all three members, I suggest that the students take an­ other twenty to thirty minutes to revise their contracts in the light of the feedback they have received,  and then I collect the contracts.

Our next task, I suggest, is for us to organize the  re­ sources of the class for conducting the inquiry into those units that all or most students have included in their con­ tracts (leaving  to  individual  students  responsibility  for pursuing the objectives that are more personal  and  indi­ vidualistic).  We  accomplish  this  task  by  reviewing  the inquiry units in the syllabus  (which are also those repro­ duced in Learning Resource H)  and agreeing  (as a total group)  on the answers to these questions regarding each unit:

- 1.  Should it be included in the plan for the total class or should it be left for those  individuals  who have  it in their contracts to pursue? If the former, then:
- a.  Should  an  inquiry  team  of  students  take  re­ sponsibility  for it?
- b.  Should  I  take  responsibility  for it?

- c.  Should  we  bring  in  an  outside  resource  to handle it?

Typically this procedure has resulted in six to eight units being delegated to inquiry teams and one or two to me or to  an  outside  resource.  The  next  step,  therefore,  is  to organize inquiry teams. I do this by asking each student to make a first, second, and third choice of the units he or she would like to participate in, based on the priority order of his or her needs and interests.  Then, by a show of hands, we find out how many students select each unit as their first choice. If more than eight students select one unit,  negotiations  are entered into  to try  to  get  students with  strong  second  choices  to  move  over  to  a  smaller team.  (It  has  been  my  experience  that  when  teams  are larger than eight they have difficulty organizing for work.)

The option is left open for students to elect to work on individual projects rather than to participate in an inquiry team, and usually in a class of thirty about half a dozen will  elect  to  do  so.  But  frequently  these  ' ndependents' i organize themselves into mutual-help groups to share their experiences in their independent projects.

Usually there is sufficient time left in this third session for the inquiry teams to have  a brief meeting to get  ac­ quainted, identify special interests, and agree on tasks  to be pursued in the following week. Before the teams meet, however,  I  review  the  responsibilities  they  have  under­ taken and suggest possible ways to organize to carry out their responsibilities. For example, in this course the task of each team is to learn all it can from the literature and from resource people on  campus  and  in the  community about its content unit and then to plan how it can present a learning experience to the rest of the class to help them get the essence of what the team learned  about its  unit. The tasks of all teams are reviewed in open meeting, so

that  all  teams  understand  the  tasks  of  the  other  teams and so that problems of territorial conflict can be resolved. I strongly urge the members of the teams to take time in their first meeting to build relationships with one another as persons before starting to work.

## 4.  FOURTH  MEETING.

(Contract  revision  and  team  planning.)

During the week between the third and fourth meetings I  block off ample  time in my date book to allow me  to study the contracts  carefully  and  to  write  my  questions, reactions,  and  suggestions  either  in  the  margins  or  on separate slips of paper which are then clipped to the con­ tracts. As students enter the room at the beginning of the fourth session I hand them their contracts and allow about half an hour for them to examine my comments and con­ sult with me about them.  Then I suggest that those  stu­ dents who want to revise their contracts do so in the fol­ lowing week and turn the revised versions in to me at the fifth session. I emphasize that the contracts are subject to renegotiation at any time through the twelfth session,  on the score that their objectives, strategies,  and ideas about evidence may change as a result of their inquiry  experi­ ences.

The remaining  time  (usually  over  two  hours)  of  this session is devoted to team meetings, while I stand by for consultation or resource help. During this first meeting of the teams, the members usually probe one another'  inter­ s ests  and resources more deeply than was possible in the large meetings, review their resource materials,  and then divide  responsibility  among  themselves  for  carrying  out their inquiry.  Frequently  a  coordinator is  elected  at this session,  although  many  teams  are  able  to  operate  effi­ ciently without designated leadership.

- 5.  FIFTH,  SIXTH,  AND  SEVENTH  MEETINGS.

(Team work.)

At the beginning of the fifth session I receive any re­ vised  contracts,  which  I  agree  to  return  the  following week. At the start of each  of these  three  sessions  I  also ask if any team has run into problems that need the atten­ tion  of  all  of  us,  and  I  emphasize  that  I  am  available during these sessions as a consultant and resource person. (In my early experience with inquiry teams I discovered that there was a reluctance to use me as a helper, probably because that might be interpreted as a sign of dependence. So, in recent years, I have made a point of raising this as an issue before  the  teams  start working,  and  suggesting that one  of the  competencies  of  self-directed learning  is the ability to make effective use of human as well as ma­ terial resources. I even take the time often to spell out the resources I have that might be useful to the teams.)

At the beginning of the seventh meeting I point out that the task now facing the teams is to design learning experi­ ences which will enable the rest of the students to acquire the content of their respective inquiry units. I urge  them to consider carefully how they can design experiences that will involve the other students actively in an inquiry, rather than settle for a design in which the content will be trans­ mitted to them as passive recipients.  I usually give illus­ trations of both types of design from previous classes, and suggest resources  (such as my Modern Practice of Adult Education) that might help them with ideas about the de­ signing  of  learning  experiences.  At  this  point,  also,  we agree on dates for the teams' presentations, and I remind them that the evidence of fulfillment of their contracts is due at the thirteenth meeting.  (I should point out that it is quite common for a team to require more time to com-

plete the design of its learning experience, and so out-of­ class team meetings are often  arranged.)

A part of the scheduling of dates for team presentations is agreement as to the amount of time each team will have. Some  inquiry  units  are  more  complex  than  others  and require more time. Typically about half the teams accept a one-hour limitation, with the understanding that I shall have a half hour following the presentation  to introduce additional or corrective information and to engage the en­ tire  class  in  an  analysis  of  the  team '   design.  On  about s half the dates, therefore,  two teams make their presenta­ tions. The other half of the teams are allocated a two-hour period, with me having one hour for comment and analy­ sis.  I  might add that my input  at these  sessions  is  often quite substantial, but the fact that it is building on what the  students  have  contributed  causes  it  to  be  received less as a transmission than as a continuation of dialogue.

## 6.  EIGHTH  THROUGH  THIRTEENTH  MEETINGS.

(Presentation of learning experiences.)

In the early years of my experimentation with inquiry teams, several of the team presentations tended to be fairly stereotypic transmissions of information by lectures, audio­ visual  presentations,  panel  discussions,  symposiums,  and the like. The norm seemed to become established that every team member must have equal time ' on the air.'  But as students gained more experience and got feedback on their presentations, this norm gave way to the norm that presen­ tations should be creative and involving, regardless of how many students on the team got to show off. By now, most team presentations are highly creative experiments in par­ ticipative learning, with such designs as micro-workshops, simulated  field  experiences,  participative  cases,  telelec­ tures, group interviews of experts,  original dramatic  pre-

sentations, and the like. Almost all teams prepare handout materials, ranging from  annotated  bibliographies  to  elab­ orate collections of reprints,  manuals,  guidelines,  and  in­ struments.

At the end of the twelfth session I remind the students that their contracts, with supportive evidence of fulfillment, are due at the beginning of the next meeting.

## 7.  FOURTEENTH  MEETING.

(Completion of contract evidence.)

As soon as all the students have arrived I ask them to group  themselves  into  the  consultative  triads  that  were formed in the second meeting. I suggest that each student be allotted up to forty-five minutes to present evidence of accomplishment  of  objectives  to  his  or  her  two  consul­ tants; with them raising such questions  as these:

- a.  Concerning the evidence of accomplishment:
- (1)  Is  the  evidence  for  each  objective  clearly relevant to that objective?
- (2)  Is the evidence reliable and convincing? b.  Concerning the criteria and means for validat­ ing the  evidence:
- (1)  Are  the  criteria  clear  and  comprehensive?
- (2)  Has  the  evidence  been  convincingly  vali­ dated according to these criteria?
- (3)  How would we rate the degree of accom­ plishment of each objective?

Frequently students  use their consultants  as  validators of evidence they  are  in  a position  to judge,  such  as  the student'   contribution  to  the  class.  Examples  of  ratings s scales students have constructed for this purpose are pre­ sented  in  Learning  Resource  O.

During the remaining time  in  the three-hour  period  I ask the triads to pool their thinking about any unresolved

questions or issues  concerning the content of the course that should be raised in the last meeting.

## 8.  FIFTEENTH  MEETING.

## (Course  evaluation.)

As the students enter the room I hand them back their contracts  and  portfolios  of evidence,  with  my  comments and proposed grade. Then I suggest that if they have any question about my comments or the grade they talk with me after class or in my office.

For  the  next hour I  invite  the  students  to  raise  unre­ solved questions or issues, to each of which I respond.

Then  I  announce  that  I  need  their  evaluation  of  the entire  course  and  my  performance  as  a  facilitator  and resource.  (I have experimented with a number of instru­ ments and procedures for collecting evaluative  data,  but the  one  that  seems  to  produce  the  best  results  is  the simplest of all.)  I form random groups of five or six stu­ dents  each- simply  by  having  them  count  off  and  then designating different areas of the room for those with the various numbers to congregate. The charge to each group is twofold:  They are a)  to agree among themselves as to the  three  or  four  most  useful  evaluative  questions  that might be asked about a learning experience of this kind, and b)  to tabulate the answers the members of the group give to these questions. I ask each group to select one per­ son to report the tabulations.

I  find  that  the  groups  usually  complete  their  tasks  in thirty to forty minutes,  and then I call on the group re­ porters  to read each  question and the  answers  to it.  My experience  has  been  that  the  questions  are  usually very thoughtful and probing,  and  that the  answers  are  highly positive. But I have yet to go through this process without getting  at least  one- and  often  several- suggestions  for

major improvement in the course procedures and my per­ formance.  I  close  the  session  by  thanking  the  students for their help.

(If  you  are  interested  in  seeing  how  I  conducted  an earlier version of this same course, without learning con­ tracts, see pages 371-376 of my Modern Practice of Adult Education: Andragogy versus Pedagogy.)

I hope that you will have as exciting  and rewarding a time as I have had in learning how to be a facilitator and resource  to  self-directed  learners.

## The Self-Concept of a Self-Directing Person

It  is  suggested  in  Learning  R esource  B  that  one  of  the competencies possessed by self-directing learners is a con ­ cept  of  themselves  as  nondependent  and  self-directing persons. H ow  does one develop such a self-concept? C er­ tainly a starting point is  having a clear picture of what it means- being able to visualize how you would feel,  how you  would  think,  what  you  would  do  if  you  were  com ­ pletely  self-directing.  Presented  below   are  som e  descrip­ tions  of  self-directed  learners  (or  self-directed  learning) that may help you construct a m odel for yourself and, by comparing  where  you  are  now  in  your  thinking  about yourself  with  that  m odel,  discover  aspects  of  your  selfconcept that might need strengthening.

The  adult  able  to  break  the  habits  of  slovenly  mentality and  willing  to  devote  himself seriously  to  study  when  study no longer holds forth the lure of pecuniary gain is,  one must admit, a personality in whom many negative aims and desires have already been eliminated. Under examination, and viewed from  the  standpoint  of  adult  education,  such  personalities

seem  to  want  among  other  things,  intelligence,  power,  selfexpression,  freedom,  creativity,  appreciation,  enjoyment,  fel­ lowship.  Or,  stated  in  terms  of  the  Greek  ideal,  they  are searchers  after  the  good life.  They  want  to  count  for some­ thing; they want their experiences to be vivid and meaningful; they  want  their  talents  to  be  utilized;  they  want  to  know beauty and joy; and they want all of these realizations of their total personalities to be shared in communities of fellowship. Briefly they want to improve themselves; this is their realistic and  primary  aim.  But  they  want  also  to  change  the  social order so that vital personalities will be creating a new environ­ ment in which their aspirations may be properly expressed.

. . .   if  genuine  dialogue  is  to  arise,  everyone  who  takes part  in  it  must  bring  himself  into  it.  And  that  also  means that he must be willing on each occasion to say what is really in his mind  about the  subject of  the  conversation.  And  that means further that on each occasion  he  makes the  contribu­ tion  of  his  spirit  without  reduction  and  without  shifting  his ground.  Even  men  of  great  integrity  are  under  the  illusion that they are not bound to say everything ' they have to say.' But in  the  great faithfulness  which is the  climate  of  genuine dialogue,  what I have to  say  at  any  one  time  already  has  in me the character of something that wishes to be uttered,  and I must not keep it back, keep it in myself.

-Martin  Buber,  ' Elements  of  the  Interhuman,' translated  by  Ronald  G.  Smith,  in  The  Knowledge of Man,  edited  by  Maurice  Friedman (Harper and Row, Inc., New York,  1965.)

These populations  [high learners]  are  marked  by  learning, by efforts to achieve their inherent potential, and by curiosity and  joie  de  vivre.  Yet,  at  the  same  time,  these  people  like their present job, understand and accept their own character­ istics, are not strongly dissatisfied with their present self. They

have the confidence and courage to reveal their real self. They have clearly directed interests:  they  choose  their  own  career and  activities  and  are  not  pushed  by  external  forces.  They strive  to  achieve  certain  major  goals,  are  spurred  on  rather than blocked by obstacles, and are productive and successful. Their relationship with at least a few people tends to be com ­ passionate, loving, frank, and effective.

-Allen Tough,  The Adult'  Learning Projects s (Ontario Institute  for Studies  in Education, Toronto,  1971), p.  28.

The school of the future  must make the  object  of  educa­ tion  the  subject  of  his  own  education.  The  man  submitting to  education  must  become  the  man  educating  himself;  edu­ cation of others must become the  education of oneself.  This fundamental change in the individual'  relationship to himself s is  the  most  difficult  problem  facing  education  for  the  future decades  of scientific  and  technical  revolution,  (p.  161)

Learning  to  learn  is  not  just  another  slogan.  It  denotes a  specific  pedagogic  approach  that teachers  must  themselves master if they w' nt to be  able to pass it on to others.  It also a involves the acquisition of work habits and the  aw'akening of motivations w'ich must  be  shaped  in  childhood  and  adoles­ h cence  by  the  programmes  and  methods  in  schools  and  uni­ versities.  Each  individual'   aspirations  to  self-learning  must s be realized by providing him- not only in school and univer­ sity but elsew'ere too, under conditions  and circumstances  of h all  kinds- with  the  means,  tools,  and  incentives  for  making his personal studies  a fruitful  activity,  (p.  209)

-Edgar Faure,  and others, Learning to Be (UNESCO, Paris,  1972).

The  basic  tenet  of  democracy  has  been  stated  in  these terms:  ' When  men  are  free,  they  can  find  their  own  best ways.'  But w'at is  a  free  man? A man with a full belly? A h man without problems? A man with no pressures? Free to do as he pleases? When such things  are  achieved,  a man is  still

only part way there. People need more; they need the freedom to  become.  Scientists  who  have  written  about  the  nature  of self-actualization  are  generally  agreed  that  one  characteristic of such fortunate persons  is  the  possession  of a high  degree of  self-esteem.  They  see  themselves  in  essentially  positive ways.

It  would  be  hard,  indeed,  to  overestimate  the  importance of a positive view of self for effective behavior. The self is the center of a person'  existence, his frame of reference for deal­ s ing  with  life.  Persons  who  approach  their  problems  with  an air  o f  'an  do' are  already  far  ahead  of  those  who  begin c with a  ' can'  do'attitude,  expecting  defeat.  With  a  positive t view of self one can dare, be open to experience, and confront the world with open arms and quiet certainty.

A  mature  person  is  not  one  who  has  com e  to  a  certain level of achievement and stopped there. H e is rather a matur­ ing  person- one  whose  linkages  with  life  are  constantly  be­ coming stronger and richer because his attitudes  are such  as to  encourage their growth rather than their stoppage.  A ma­ ture person, for example, is not one who knows a large num­ ber of facts.  Rather,  he is  one whose mental  habits  are such that he grows in knowledge and in the wise use of it. A mature person is not one who has built up a certain quota of human relationships- family,  friends,  acquaintances,  fellow  workers -and is ready to call a halt, dismissing the rest of the human race as unimportant.  Rather,  he is  a person who  has learned how to operate well in a human environment so that he con­ tinues both to add new people to those whom he cares about and  to  discover  new  bases  of  fellowship  with  those  already familiar.

- (Cyril  O.  Houle, *  in  his  pioneering  study  of  continuing learners,  found  that  they  profited  by  seven  key  principles:)
- 1.  Act as though you are certain to learn. Nothing so dis­ turbs the beginning adult student as the nagging  fear  that he will not be able to learn what he would like to learn. Nothing is more reassuring than the discovery through experience that he can succeed.  .   .   .  Adults can learn most things better than children, though it may take them longer to  do  so.
- 2.  Set realistic  goals- and  measure  their  accomplishment. One  frequent  obstacle  to  adult  learning  is  that  men and women,  realizing  that  they  have  the  full  power  of  their strength and vigor,  think that they ought to  be  able  to  learn without  any  effort  or  strain  whatever.  . . .   In  any  learning program,  therefore,  you  must  first  of  all  be  realistic  about what you can achieve.
- 3.  Remember  the  strength  of  your  own  point  of  view. Your learning is strongly influenced by the point of view you bring to it.  .   .   .   M ost important o f  all,  do  not let your estab­ lished  values  harden  into  such  fixed  beliefs  that  you  cannot tolerate  new  ideas.  When  this  happens,  the  process  of  edu­ cation  ceases.
- 4.  Actively fit new ideas and new facts into context.  Your greatest asset as an adult learner is the fact that your experi­ ence  enables  you  to  see  relationships.  When  a  new  idea  or fact  is  presented,  you  can  understand  it  because  you  have background  and  perspective.  And  you  can  remember  it  be­ cause you can associate it with  what you  already know  and therefore give it meaning.
- 5.  Seek help and support when you need it.  Sometimes an adult will choose to learn by himself,  and  sometimes  he will choose  to  learn  with  others.  A   balanced  learning  program combines  many  elements,  though  not  all  at  the  same  time. But  while  adults  often  teach  themselves  what  they  want  to know,  they  may  run  into  real  dangers  if  they  rely  on  this

method too consistently. .  .  .  One time when it is well to seek out a teacher is when you  are beginning the study of a  new subject. . . .  A second time when you need help is when you bog down in your studies.  . . .   A third time when  it  is  wise to seek help is when you feel the need of the social stimula­ tion of a class or a group.

- 6.  Learn beyond the point necessary for immediate recall. We all  learn many things  we  do  not  really  wish  to  remem­ ber- and which we promptly forget.  . . .   If you want to re­ member something permanently, however, you must do what the psychologist calls over-learning. Even after you can recall the  fact  or  perform  the  skill  perfectly,  you  should  keep  on reviewing it.
- 7.  Use psychological as well as logical practices. You have already  had  an  illustration  o f  this  rule.  In  Chapter  1 you were urged first to skim this book, then to read it,  and  then to examine it closely. Now it seems illogical  to many people not to go through  a book thoroughly,  digesting  a  paragraph at a time.  Yet research  has  shown  that the way  here  recom ­ mended is better.

-Cyril  O.  Houle,  Continuing  Your  Education (McGraw-Hill Book Company, New York, 1964), pp.  18-35.

Exploration  of  the  full  range  of  his  own  potentialities  is not  something  that  the self-renewing  man  leaves to the chances of life.  It is  something he  pursues  systematically,  or at least  avidly,  to  the  end  of his  days.  H e  looks  forward  to an endless and unpredictable dialogue between his potentiali­ ties and the claims of life- not only the claims he encounters but the  claims  he  invents.  And  by  potentialities  I  mean  not just  skills,  but  the  full  range  of  his  capacities  for  sensing, wondering, learning, understanding, loving, and aspiring.

The ultimate  goal  of  the  educational  system  is  to  shift  to the individual the burden of pursuing his own education. This will not be a widely shared pursuit until we get over our odd conviction that education is what goes on in school buildings and  nowhere  else.  Not  only  does  education  continue  when

schooling ends, but it is not confined to what may be studied in  adult  education  courses.  The  world  is  an  incomparable classroom,  and  life  is  a  memorable  teacher  for  those  who aren'   afraid  of  her. t

-John W.  Gardner,  Self-Renewal (Harper &amp; Row, New York,  1963), pp.  11-12.

It  appears  that  the  person  who  emerges  from  a  theoreti­ cally optimal experience of personal growth, whether through client-centered  therapy or  some  other  experience  of  learning and  development,  is  then  a  fully  functioning  person.  H e  is able to live fully in and with each  and  all of his feelings  and reactions.  He is making use  of  all  his  organic  equipment  to sense, as accurately as possible, the existential situation within and without.  He  is  using  all  of the  data  his  nervous  system can thus  supply,  using  it  in  awareness,  but  recognizing  that his total organism may be, and often is, wiser than his aware­ ness.  He  is  able  to  permit  his  total  organism  to  function  in all  its  complexity  in  selecting,  from   the  multitude  of  possi­ bilities,  that  behavior  which  in  this  moment  o f  time  will be most generally  and  genuinely  satisfying.  He  is  able  to  trust his  organism  in  this  functioning,  not  because  it  is  infallible, but because he can be fully open to the consequences of each of his actions and correct them if they prove to be less than satisfying.

He is  able  to  experience  all  of  his  feelings,  and  is  afraid of none of his feelings; he  is  his  own  sifter  of  evidence,  but is open to evidence from all sources; he is completely engaged in the process  of being  and becoming  himself,  and  thus  dis­ covers that he is soundly and realistically social; he lives com ­ pletely  in  this  moment,  but  learns  that  this  is  the  soundest living  for  all  time.  H e  is  a  fully  functioning  organism,  and because of the awareness of himself which flows freely in and through his experiences, he is a fully functioning person.

## Learning Resource E Relationship-Building Exercises

## Rationale

Students typically enter into  any activity labeled  'duca­ e tional'with the notion that the appropriate relationship for them to establish with fellow students is that of com­ petitor,  and  that  they  should  relate  to  a  teacher  as  an authority figure. This has been their conditioning, for the most part, through previous schooling. In Martin Buber' s terms, they see one another as ' its'rather than as ' I'  and s thous,'   as  objects  rather  than  as  fellow  human  beings. Furthermore, they tend to think of resources for learning as residing outside themselves- in teachers, experts, books, and the media. They usually don'  even know what t resources  their  fellow  learners  have  to  contribute,  and wouldn'  think of using these resources even if they knew t what the resources were.

Self-directed learning can flourish  only when  learners and teachers see one another as mutually helpful human beings with resources to share.

## Objectives

The objectives of these exercises are to help learners:  (1) begin to experience other learners as collaborators rather than  as  competitors,  as  human  beings  rather  than  as

things; and (2) begin to identify the resources each learner needs from,  and can  provide to,  other learners  for their mutual  learning.  Which  exercise  you  select  will  depend upon which one you feel most comfortable with and which you  feel  will  fit  best  into  the  time  limitations  and  the learners' moods.

## Exercise 1

(learner-initiated- 30 minutes)

Identify one other learner you expect to relate to in a learning project and suggest that each of you take fifteen minutes to share (1) what you are- your work or student status, your background, what special resources you have that  are  relevant  to  this  particular  learning  project;  and (2)  who you are- a few things that make you different from any other person, such as aspirations, feelings, needs, and values.

## Exercise 2

(teacher-initiated- 45  minutes  )

- a.  Explain  the  rationale  and  objectives  of  this exercise.
- b.  Ask the learners to form groups of five or six (in circles or around tables)  and take five min­ utes  each  to  share  the  following  information: (1)  what you are- your work or student status and what experiences, knowledge, or skills you have that are relevant to this particular learning situation;  and (2)  who  you  are- one  thing about you that will help the others to see you as  a  unique  human being.
- c.  Before  the  groups  start  sharing,  give  the  stu­ dents  the above  information  about  yourself (and  role  model  doing  this  within  the  fiveminute  time limit).

- d.  After the groups have completed their sharing, ask for a spontaneous reporting of the following information: (1)  did  anyone  learn  anything about  someone  else  that  was  so  unusual  that others would be interested in knowing about it (be sure that permission is given by that person before it is reported), and (2) were any special resources  uncovered that  others would like  to know about?

## Exercise 3

(teacher-initiated- 30 minutes)

- a.  Explain  the  rationale  and  objectives  of  this exercise.
- b.  Ask each student to take a sheet of 8V^-by-llinch paper, divide it into four equal boxes with pen or pencil lines, and write in a heading for each box  as indicated  below.

| I am --- (1)  What:   | I am feeling -       |
|-----------------------|----------------------|
| I want help in ---    | I can give help in - |

- c.  Ask each learner to take two minutes to write in each box the words or phrases that the head­ ing of that box stimulates in his mind by free association. (Indicate  when  each  two-minute period is up.)
- d.  Ask the students to form groups of five or six (in  circles  or  around  tables) and  take  three minutes per box to share the words or phrases in each box.  (Indicate when each three-minute period  is  up.)
- e.  After the groups have completed their sharing, ask for spontaneous reporting of the following information: (1) what  unusual  information about the ' what'and  ' who'  of the  members of the groups was surfaced;  (2)  what were the most frequent words in the ' I am feeling'box; (3)  what kinds  of resources  were  identified  as being needed; and (4) what kinds of help were identified  as  being  available?

## Exercise 4

(teacher-initiated- 30 minutes)

- a.  Explain  the  rationale  and  objectives  of  this exercise.
- b.  Ask each student to take a large sheet of news­ print, masking tape, and felt pen, find a space on a wall to hang the sheet of paper, place his or her name at the top of the sheet, inscribe the form portrayed in Exercise 3, and write in the words or phrases he or she associates with each heading.
- c.  As each student finishes, he or she walks around examining the sheets of other students  and lo­ cates  the students he  or she  identifies  with  or wants to know more about.

## Learning Resource F Consultation Skill-Practice Exercise

## Rationale

One of the characteristics of self-directed learning is that learners give help to, and receive help from, one another. One kind of help that is exchanged is straight information giving and skill training, which is the kind of help we all have had most experience with.

Another kind  of help  is  what  has  come  to  be  called ' consultation.'Its purpose is to assist individuals to think through problems for themselves  and to make their own decisions.  It  consists  of  guiding  the process of problem­ solving,  and  therefore  is  often  called  'rocess  consulta­ p tion.'  The ultimate outcome of a successful process con­ sultation is not necessarily  a better solution for the par­ ticular  problem  with  which  it  is  concerned,  but  rather greater confidence and more skill  on the part of the in­ dividual who is being helped in solving his own problems. Thus, it is  an  educational  activity more than  a problem­ solving activity, although the individual usually comes out with a better solution to the particular problem on which he is being consulted.

Most people  have  had  less  experience  with  this  kind of helping role than  with the  information-giving  kind  of role, and therefore don'  know how to do it as well. t

## Objectives

The objectives of this exercise are to provide the learner with:  (1) some guidelines for performing the role of con­ sultant;  (2)  some practice  in  performing  this  role,  with feedback from an observer and a helpee; (3)  some prac­ tice in making use of a consultant; and (4) some practice in performing the role of observer.

## Exercise

- a.  Explain  the  rationale  and  objectives  of  this exercise.
- b.  Ask  the  participants  to  arrange  themselves  in triads  quickly, picking  people  near them.
- c.  Explain that you are going to assign a letter to each participant which he or she should remem­ ber, then go around the room pointing out an A, a B, and a C in each triad.
- d.  Explain that in the next hour each person will have a brief experience performing the roles of helper, helpee,  and observer, and that you are now going to make some suggestions about per­ forming these roles.
- c.  Pass out reproductions of the ' bserver'  Guide O s Sheet'  portrayed at the end of this exercise and ask the learners to study it for a few moments.
- f. Point out that the behaviors listed  on the left side  of  the  sheet  are  those  of  the  traditional ' wise-uncle adviser,'who sees his role as being to  solve  the  problem  for  the  helpee,  whereas those on the right side are characteristic of the

- process  consultant  who  sees  his  role  as  being to assist the helpee in solving his own problem. Invite  any  questions  about  the  difference  be­ tween the two  kinds of behaviors,  and clarify any confusions.
- g.  Suggest that when a participant is in the role of helper he or she try to exhibit the behaviors on the right side  (and for reinforcement you may wish to  review  and  perhaps  illustrate  the  be­ haviors).
- h.  Suggest that when  a participant  is in  the  role of  helpee  he  or  she  try  to  make  use  of  the helper  as  a  process  consultant  as  skillfully  as possible.
- i. Suggest that when a participant is in the role of observer he or she jot down words or phrases in the appropriate box whenever he or she ob­ serves  a  behavior by the helper that seems to fit that box, so that the observer can recall that episode.
- j. Explain  that  there  will  be  three  helper-helpee consultations of twelve minutes each, and that each one will be followed by an observer'  re­ s port  of  four  minutes.
- k.  Now ask each participant to take two or three minutes  to  think  about  a  problem  he  or  she would like help on  (such as diagnosing his or her  needs  for  learning  in  this  course,  stating objectives for a learning contract, dealing with an  interpersonal  conflict,  and  the  like) and writing down on a slip of paper a one- or twoparagraph  description  of  the  problem.
- l. Start Round  1   by asking the A '  in each triad s

- to take the role  of helper,  the  B's  the  role of helpee, and the C'  the role of observer. s
- m.  At  the  end  of  twelve  minutes  call  time  and announce  that  the  observer  has  four  minutes to report his or her observations to the helper and helpee  in  his  or  her  triad.
- n.  At the end of four minutes call time and start Round  2,  in  which  B  is  the  helper,  C  is  the helpee,  and A  is  the observer.
- o.  At the end of twelve minutes call time and ask the  observers  to  give  their  feedback  for  four minutes.
- p.  At the end of four minutes call time and start Round  3, in which  C is  the  helper,  A  is  the helpee,  and B is the observer.
- q.  At the end of twelve minutes call time and ask the  observers  to  give  their  feedback  for  four minutes.
- r. At the end of four minutes  announce that the exercise is over, and that it is time to  analyze the  experience.  Invite  responses from the par­ ticipants  to  such  questions  as:
- (1)  How  did you feel playing the role  of this kind of helper?
- (2)  At what points did you find it tempting to switch  to  the  role  of  ''ise-uncle  advicew giver' ? Why? What did you do about it?
- (3)  When  you  were  a  helpee,  what  kinds  of things your helper did were especially help­ ful or hindering?
- (4)  When  you  were  a  helper,  what  kinds  of things your helpee did were especially help­ ful or hindering?
- (5)  How useful was the feedback from the ob-

server?  What  kinds  of  observations  were most  (and  least)  helpful?

- (6)  How  did  you  feel  performing  the  role  of observer? Now that you have had this ex­ perience, what would you do differently as an  observer?

## Learning Resource G Self-Assessment Exercise

## Rationale

Self-directed learning starts with learners becoming aware of some need for learning. This need may be to  acquire some particular knowledge or skill in order to gain certain benefits,  such  as  a  better job  or  greater  self-confidence, more self-esteem or greater competence  in performing  a role; or the need may be simply to enjoy the pleasure of learning or to satisfy a curiosity. In general, however, the clearer that learners are about their needs for learning in a  particular  situation  the  more  efficiently  can  they  plan their learning.

## Objectives

The objectives of this  exercise  are  to help learners:  (1) gain an understanding of the self-diagnostic process,  and (2)  have  an  exploratory  experience  in  practicing  this process.

## The  Self-Diagnostic  Process *

The diagnostic process involves three steps:  (1)  the de­ velopment of  a  model  of  desired  behaviors  or  required

- * Adapted from Malcolm S. Knowles, The Modern Practice of Adult Education: Andragogy versus Pedagogy  (New York:  Asso­ ciation Press,  1970), pp. 273-284.

competencies;  (2)  the assessment of the present level  of performance by the individual in each of these behaviors or competencies; and (3)  the assessment of the gaps be­ tween the model  and the present performance.

## I.  DEVELOPING COMPETENCY MODELS

Models of desired behavior or required competence can be  developed  in  several  ways:

## 1.  Through  research.

The Cooperative Extension Service, for example, has been able to  develop  rather  specific  models  of  the competencies  required  for  successful  farming  by virtue  of  the  research  findings  of  state  agricultural experiment  stations  regarding  which  practices  pro­ duce the  best  crops.  Many  state  extension  services have  conducted  research  on  required  competencies for  many  other  roles  as  well,  such  as  homemaker, youth  leader,  community-change  agent,  and  farm business  manager.  Considerable  research  has  been done by government agencies, industry, and the uni­ versities  on  competencies  required  for  supervision and  executive  management- indeed,  leadership  in general. The competencies required by teachers, doc­ tors, hospital administrators, nurses, social workers, and  other  professional  roles  have  been  subjects  of a good  deal of research But for  most  of  the  nonvocational roles that are central in the lives of human beings there is little research regarding required com­ petencies.

## 2.  Through the judgments of experts.

The literature abounds with judgments of experts re­ garding the required competencies for performing a

variety of roles, ranging from a wide range of occu­ pations to leisure-time user. Many institutions make use of their own experts- their executives, personnel staff,  supervisors,  and  field  workers- to  construct models of required competencies for roles unique to their particular institutions.  For example, when  the Girls Scouts of the U.S.A. decided to launch a new program of leadership training, they convened a con­ ference  of  experts  from  various  departments  and levels of the organization who identified ten areas of required competencies for troop leaders.  They then constructed  ' odel statements'describing the gen­ m eral  competencies  required  and  listed  specific  be­ havior related  to  each  competency.

## 3.  Through  task  analysis.

By  means  of  more  or  less  elaborate  observations, time  study,  and  record-keeping  of  several  people actually performing a given role, it is possible to con­ struct a model of the competencies possessed by the most effective performers. A good task analysis con­ sists of a categorization of the situations encountered in a role and descriptions of the types of action and related  competencies  required  to  cope  with  these situations  successfully.  Such  a  task  analysis  can  be made by people associated with  a role,  such as su­ pervisors, colleagues, and subordinates, but its value is  likely  to  be  greater  if  made  by  more  objective observers.

## 4.  Through  group participation.

A fourth  alternative  is,  of  course,  for  a  group  to build its own model. And if time and circumstances permit, this is probably the alternative that will result in the greatest learning- for the process of building

a model is itself a learning process,  and  the  model that results, even though it will perhaps be cruder, is one  to  which  the  participants  will  have  a  deeper c o m m itm ent. The  sources  of  data  available  to  a group in building its own model include (1) research findings and judgments of experts as reported in the literature, (2) observation by the participants of role models in the field,  (3)  presentations by experts in the classroom,  (4)  interviews by the participants of experts in the community,  (5) the participants' own experiences  and  observations,  and  (6)  the  experi­ ence of the instructor and leaders of the sponsoring institution.

For the task of model-building to be manageable by  a  total  group  it  is  desirable  that  it  be  broken down into subtasks, with a separate team of partici­ pants for each subtask. For example, for a course on ' Effective Human Relations,'teams might be orga­ nized to  develop lists of the  required  competencies of  (a)  knowledge,  (b)  insight,  (c)  attitude,  (d) skill, (e) interest, and (f) value, for effective humanrelations  performance.  The  instructor  would  serve as a consultant and resource person to the teams in identifying  sources  of  information  about  each  type of required competence, and after  a reasonable pe­ riod of search the teams would pool  their findings. For other subjects or roles a different set of subtasks may be desirable.

Any contemporary model developed early in an activity must, of course, be seen as being preliminary and tenta­ tive. As the participants learn more and more about their area of inquiry, their perception of required competencies

will change. It is highly desirable, therefore, that the model be reviewed periodically during the activity.

It is important, too, if models are brought from the out­ side- from research, from task analysis, or from expertsthat they  be  reviewed  and  tested  by  the  participants  so that they have the opportunity to modify or restate them and make them more their own.

## II.  ASSESSING  THE  PRESENT LEVEL OF PERFORMANCE

Here we enter relatively new  and unexplored territory in the technology of adult education.  Because adult edu­ cation was tied so closely to pedagogy for so long,  little attention was given to developing procedures and tools for helping adults diagnose their own needs- after all, if the teachers  already  know  what  they  need,  why  waste  time getting the students into the act?  So the reservoir of ex­ perience and materials for student self-diagnosis of present level of performance is extremely limited. Indeed, there is probably no  aspect of the technology of adult education that is in greater need  of creative  contributions by  inno­ vative practitioners. But there has been enough experience by a few innovators in the last few years to give evidence of the fruitfulness of energy spent in this direction and to provide some helpful guidelines  and procedures.

Because competition for grades is such a strong element in  the  tradition  of  education,  most  adults  enter  into  a learning activity in a defensive frame of mind. One of their strongest impulses is to show how good they are. So the notion of engaging in a self-diagnostic process for the pur­ pose of revealing one'  weaknesses- one'  need for addi­ s s tional learning- is both strange and threatening. It is cru­ cial,  therefore- particularly  in  the  case  of  adults  having

their first andragogical experience- that ways be devised for helping participants get into a self-diagnostic frame of mind.

Certainly the establishment of a warm, supportive, non­ threatening  climate  as  described  above  is  a  prerequisite condition  to  beginning to work  in  this  direction.  I  have found in my own experience that a brief presentation by the instructor of the rationale for self-diagnosis as an es­ sential feature of self-directed learning helps to make the concept more intellectually acceptable- particularly if re­ inforced by the instructor'  own example of seeking feed­ s back regarding his own deficiencies.

Let us be clear about one thing before proceeding with this matter of assessing performance.  We  are not talking here about a highly precise mathematical process of quan­ titative  measurement  of  the  full  range  of  behaviors  re­ quired for performing  any set of functions.  Such  an  as­ piration would be totally unrealistic given the present state of the human sciences- and perhaps, given the complexity of human nature, it always will be. Rather, we are talking about a process that is more sensitizing than  measuring, more concerned with  setting  broad  directions  of  growth rather  than  defining  terminal  behaviors.  The  purpose  of the process we are concerned with here is to help an indi­ vidual  adult look objectively  at his  present level  of per­ formance of a relatively small sample of behaviors that are important to him at a given time in his development and to determine where he wants to invest energy in improving his performance in  the light of his model  of desired  be­ haviors.

Different kinds of performance call for different kinds of assessment procedures. Performance assessment in the area of knowledge requires the participant to demonstrate in some way what he knows (or at least can recall). If the

desired  knowledge  is  in  an  established  academic-subject field, or in any of several technical or vocational fields, one or more of the nationally standardized subject-knowledge tests may help a participant to assess his present level of performance.  If  a  standardized  test  is  not  available,  a teacher-made test could be used. But I have found studentmade tests  to  be  generally  more  acceptable  and  usually just  as  effective.

Performance  assessment  in  the  area  of  understanding and  insight  requires  that  a  participant  demonstrate  his ability  to  size  up  situations,  see  patterns,  develop  cate­ gories,  figure  out  cause-and-effect  relationships,  and  in general to apply knowledge and thought processes to the analysis and solution of problems. Some standardized tests of  critical-thinking  ability  are  designed  to  give  evidence regarding this  type  of performance,  as  are teacher-made essay tests. But  adults  are likely to  find  simulation  exer­ cises, in which they act out their understanding and insight in handling ' ive'problems, to be more realistic and rele­ l vant.  For  example,  in  a  supervisory-training  program groups of participants  can  take  turns  showing  how  they would handle various ' critical incidents'supervisors typi­ cally face in dealing with subordinates, superiors, and col­ leagues; by comparing the various solutions tried and their effects, each trainee gets some insight into his understand­ ing of these problems. Role playing and, on a more elab­ orate scale, business games are used for the same purpose.

Performance  assessment  in  the  area of skills  requires that the participant do the action in question and have his proficiency rated in some way. A simple illustration of a skill-performance assessment procedure is provided by the device commonly used in public-speaking classes of having each participant make a short speech and having it rated by the other participants or a panel of speech experts on

such scales as adequacy of vocabulary, clarity of expres­ sion, pacing,  rhythm,  gesturing,  poise,  conveying  of  sin­ cerity, and other elements of the skill of speaking in pub­ lic. The composite rating of the judges is then transposed onto a profile sheet, giving the participant a quick perspec­ tive on the areas of skill needing most improvement. Simi­ lar  profiles  can  be  drawn  up  from  observer-ratings  of performance in real or simulated situations for such other skills as machine operating, instruction giving, interview­ ing,  discussion leading,  delegating,  conflict  handling,  de­ cision-making,  and  any of the  wide  variety  of  skills  in­ volved in artistic and physical activities. For  the assessment of certain basic skills, such as reading, computing, finger dexterity,  etc.,  standardized  tests  are  available.

Performance assessment in the areas of attitudes, inter­ ests, and values is much more difficult and even less pre­ cise than in the  areas of knowledge,  understanding,  and skill. Some standardized tests exist that can be used to get verbalizations about self-perceived attitudes, interests, and values, but there is little assurance that these are the ones that will be  acted  on in  a particular  situation  when the chips are down. Role playing, and especially reverse role playing (as when a white person takes the role of a black person and vice versa), has been used extensively in hu­ man-relations training to help individuals get insight into their attitudes as they are revealed in action. And decision­ making exercises, in which the individual has to decide be­ tween two values  (such  as  risky  profit  versus  security), can help a person discover which values he chooses under pressure. But the technology has to advance much farther than it has  before we  can get very  clear  assessments  in these areas.

## III. ASSESSMENT OF LEARNING NEEDS

The final  step  in the  self-diagnostic process  is  for the individual to assess the gaps that exist between his model of desired behaviors and his present level of performance. In a few situations, where the competencies involved are fairly simple and mechanical, the profile of gaps  (which, of course,  represent  needs  for  further learning)  may  be quite  precise  and  complete.  But  in  most  situations  this process of self-diagnosis is more artistic than scientific.  It is,  realistically,  merely  a  way  of  helping  an  individual make more sensitive judgments about which of many pos­ sible directions he might take in his continuing self-devel­ opment at a given time.

The fact is that the very idea of self-diagnosis by learn­ ers  is  so  new  that  the  tools  and  procedures  for  helping them do it are primitive and inadequate. Clearly, this will be an area of great technological ferment in the next few years and I urge my readers to put their creative energy to work on this great need and to share their innovations with me. For if one thing stands out about adult learning it is that a self-diagnosed need for learning produces much greater motivation to learn than does an externally diag­ nosed need.

## Exercise

- a.  Select some fairly simple competence you would  like  to  improve  your  performance  in, such as becoming  a  more  polished public speaker  (or  swimmer,  or  golfer,  or  gardener, or dressmaker).
- b.  Construct a model of the elements  (knowledge, skills,  attitudes) that  constitute  excellence  in the performance of this competence. For exam-

pie,  in  the  case  of public speaking,  these  ele­ ments might turn out to be as follows:

- (1)  A broad knowledge of the vocabulary used in  a  given  subject-matter  area.
- (2)  Skill  in  expressing  one'   ideas  simply  and s clearly.
- (3)  Skill in pacing one'  speech gracefully and s with  proper  emphasis.
- (4)  The  ability  to  project  one'   voice  so  that s it can be heard distinctly by a large audi­ ence.
- (5)  The  ability  to  organize  one'   presentation s logically,  with  supportive  facts,  and  with clarifying illustrations. And so on.
- (6)  It might be useful for you to check your list of elements with two or three experienced public speakers in order to get their ideas about the adequacy of your model.
- c.  Construct a rating scale,  as illustrated  below.
- d.  Make a speech and have it rated by the audi­ ence or by a panel of expert speakers.
- e.  Transpose  the  average  of their  ratings  onto  a rating  scale  sheet  so  that  you  end  up  with  a profile showing your strengths  and weaknesses in terms  of your model,  as  follows:

## Learning Resources I Some Guidelines for

## Stating Objectives  *

In  actual  educational  practice,  learning  objectives  are stated  in  many  ways.  All  too  often  they  are  stated  as things which the instructor or the activity is going to do, as,  for  example,  ' to  give  information  about  .   . ' to demonstrate  .   . ' to  broaden  appreciation  of  .   . or ' to create an awareness of .   . (These are, incidentally, direct  quotes  from  activity  announcements  in  my  files.) These are not really statements of educational objectives, but rather of instructors' intentions. For education is not concerned with having the instructor perform certain  ac­ tivities; it is  concerned  with  helping  students achieve changes in behavior.

Objectives are sometimes stated in the form of lists of topics, concepts, or other content elements to be covered in an activity. Thus, a course in ' rinciples and Methods P of Supervision'in a catalog in front of me at this moment

- * Adapted from Malcolm S. Knowles,  The Modern Practice of Adult Education  (New York:  Association Press,  1970), pp.  284287.

states its objectives as being to cover 'ole and responsibil­ r ity  of  supervisors;  planning;  defining  tasks;  establishing standards and controls; delegation of responsibility; com­ munication; motivation and morale ...'Objectives stated in the form of content elements may help students choose between activities,  but  they  are  not  satisfactory  learning objectives since they do not specify what the students are to do with the elements- memorize them, be able to apply them  to  life  situations,  feel  differently  about  them,  or what.

A third way in which objectives  are often stated is in the form of generalized  patterns of behavior without the content area to which the behavior applies being specified. For example, in front of me now is a brochure describing a library discussion program which states as its first objec­ tive ' to develop critical thinking.' But it doesn'  say about t what. Further down the list is 'o develop broad interests' t without any indication of the areas in which interests are to be aroused.

In my own practice I have found  that it helps  me  to discipline myself to include both behavioral  and  content components if I use the phraseology ' to develop ...  (in the sense of ' o help participants develop'   in ...'I have t ) found it useful,  also,  to  have  a general  typology  of  be­ havioral aspects of objectives as a frame of reference for organizing a set of objectives for an activity. Hilda Taba proposes  the  following  typology:

- Knowledge:  Facts,  Ideas,  Concepts Reflective Thinking -interpretation  of  data -^-application  of  facts  and  principles -logical reasoning Values and Attitudes

## Sensitivities  and  Feelings Skills *

A  somewhat  simpler  typology  is employed  in  the ' Worksheet  for  Stating  Learning  Objectives' illustrated below, which I have used in some of my courses for de­ veloping  specific  statements  of  objectives  collaboratively with  my  students.  After  the  students  have  experienced some self-assessment  such  as  that  described  in  Learning Resource H, they are able to specify quite concretely the content areas  in  which  they  need  behavioral  changes  of each of the five types. One of the advantages of organizing objectives  according to a typology  of this  sort  is  that  it provides direct guidance in the selection of techniques for each learning experience; for, as will be shown in Learn­ ing Resource K, certain techniques  are more effective in helping students achieve certain objectives than are others.

The discussion of learning objectives  up  to  this  point has been in the broad humanistic sense of self-determined directions of self-development, with the instructor and the students  participating  mutually  in  the  process  of  their formulation.  But  there  is  a  rather  substantial  body  of literature on objectives  of a very different kind;  and  the discussion  should  not  be  ended  without  some  acknowl­ edgment of this other approach to the subject.

Programmed instruction is geared to a concept of ' ter­ minal behavior'  objectives, with terminal behavior defined as ' the behavior you would like your learner to be able to demonstrate at the time your influence over him ends.'f The specifications for this  type of objective  are  summa­ rized as follows:

- * Hilda  Taba,  Curriculum  Development:  Theory  and  Practice (New York:  Harcourt, Brace and World,  1962), pp. 211-28.
- t Robert  F.  Mager,  Preparing  Instructional  Objectives  (Palo Alto, California:  Fearon Publishers,  1962), p. 2.

- 1 .   A statement of instructional objectives is a collection of words or symbols describing one of your educational intents.
- 2.  An objective will communicate your intent to the degree you  have  described  what  the  learner  will  be  doing  when demonstrating his achievement and how you will know when he is doing it.
- 3.  To describe terminal behavior  (what the learner will be doing) :
- a.  Identify the  name of the over-all behavior  act.
- b.  Define  the  important  conditions  under  which  the behavior is to occur  (givens and/or restrictions  and limitations).
- c.  Define the criterion of acceptable performance.
- 4.  Write a separate statement for each objective; the more statements you have, the better  chance you have of making clear your intent.
- 5.  If you give each learner a copy of your objectives, you may not have to do much else [ j/ c].*

These  statements  are  from  a  book  entitled  Preparing Instructional  Objectives.  But  the  educational  philosophy expressed in the subtitle of the book- '  book for teach­ A ers  and  student  teachers  . . .   for  anyone  interested  in transmitting  skills  and  knowledge  to  others' -explains why this approach to objectives is not given greater atten­ tion in this book about self-directed learning.

- * Ibid.,  p.  5 3 .  The  sic  means  that  this  is  precisely  what  the author says, but I doubt if he means what I suspect-that by this time the student,  if he is  an  adult,  will  have  disappeared.

## Questioning Strategies and Techniques

Self-directed learning means learners engaging in inquiry. Inquiry  means  getting  answers  to  questions  through  the collection  and  analysis  of data.  The  prerequisite  skill  of inquiry,  therefore,  is  the  ability  to  formulate  questions that can be answered by data.

Unfortunately, this is a skill that few of us have learned through our schooling. Rather, we have been taught to ask questions that can be answered by authority  (a teacher, a textbook)  or by faith.  For example,  ' What  grade  will the teacher give me?'is a question that can be answered only  by  authority;  ' Will  the  teacher  grade  fairly?'is  a question that usually can be answered only by faith; ' What will  be  the  effect  on  my  grade  of  two  different  ways  of studying,'   however,  is  a  question  that  can  be  answered through  inquiry  (using  an  experimental  design).

## DESIGNING A PLAN  OF INQUIRY

A plan of inquiry involves asking  six  specific  process questions  and  testing  their  adequacy  against  certain  cri­ teria,  as  follows:

- 1.  What is the question you want to get an answer to? With the criteria of adequacy being:
- a.  Is it a question worth asking?
- b.  Is it a question you really care  about?
- c.  Is it a question that is answerable by data?
- d.  Is  the  question  clear  and  understandable  to others?
- 2.  What data  are required to  answer this  question? With the criteria of adequacy being:
- a.  Have subquestions requiring different kinds of data  been  identified?
- b.  Are you clear about the data required to  an­ swer this particular question and no  other?
- c.  Are  these  data  available  to  you  within  your limitations  of  time,  money,  etc.?
- 3.  What are the sources of the required  data? With the criteria of adequacy being:
- a.  Are  the  sources  feasible  for  you,  i.e.,  within your reach  and competence?
- b.  Are the  sources  reliable  and  authentic  repos­ itories of the particular data you  require?
- c.  Are  the  requirements  for  data  from  primary versus  secondary  sources  clearly  delineated?
- 4.  What means will be used  to collect the  data? With the criteria of adequacy being:
- a.  Are these the most efficient and effective means for collecting these particular data from these sources?
- b.  Are the means within your competence to use, or do you need further training for them?
- c.  Will  these  means  produce  reliable  and  valid data?
- d.  Will  they  produce  data  that  will  answer  the question you are asking?

- 5.  How will the data be analyzed so as to answer the question you are asking?
- With the criteria of adequacy being:
- a.  Are the methods of analysis within your com­ petence  to  use,  or  do  you  require  further training  for  them?
- b.  Will these methods of analysis produce a clear and significant answer to the specific question raised?
- c.  Are these the most efficient and relevant meth­ ods of analysis for the data provided  and the question posed?
- 6.  How will the answer to the question be presented?
- a.  Will  the  answer  be  clearly  supported  by  the data?
- b.  Is this  form of presentation the most efficient and  understandable  possible?

## SOME SKILL PRACTICE IN QUESTIONING TECHNIQUES *

Students  can  learn  a  great  deal  about  questions  and their  effective  use  from just  being  allowed  opportunities to formulate some  and carry out investigations  of them. However,  informal  learning  about  questions  should  not exclude formal instruction.  Students  can have periods  of time  designated  for focusing  on  their process  of inquiry or problem-solving. Such focus would naturally deal with questions.  Here  students  can  analyze  the  types  of ques­ tions they have been asking. Are they satisfied with their questions? Have they  considered their questions  produc-

tive  in  directing  them  to  designated  goals?  What  is  the type of question they most commonly formulate?

Students  who  are  presented  opportunities  to  inquire within the discovery curriculum will most likely  develop felt needs for formal discussion of questions. Students who are  active  in  learning  need  to  have  time  scheduled  for analyzing  just  how  they  proceed.  We  can  discuss  with students the several types of questions according to some guide  such  as  Bloom.*  We  should  be  sure  that  it  is  a guided discussion rather than just an exposition. We can present for discussion the idea that various types of ques­ tions will provide certain types of data. We might direct consideration as to what students do in questioning when they wish  to  formulate  a  generalization.

Before commencing formal discussion of questions, the teacher  assigns  students  the  task  of listing  some  of  the major questions they used in dealing with  particular re­ search  topics.  This  list  can  then  be  considered  in  class group  discussion.  Students  can  analyze  and  criticize  the different questions listed. Just what are the characteristics of the many questions  asked? Why  do you  suppose  this question  was  asked?  If  a  student  wished  to  develop  a generalization,  should  he  have  asked  primarily  compre­ hension questions?

Such focus on questions also can lead to a consideration of the numerous questioning strategies the students used. Students engaged in oral investigation with a team partner might record  their questions  as  they  consider  data.  The tapes  could then  be  studied  to  check  if certain  types  of questions were used  at the beginning of the  inquiry and other types at the end. Where did the student put his most

significant questions in relation to his search? Did he com­ prise a list of significant questions to search for, or did he just react to specific types of data and then draw questions from this experience?

Students also should have time for practicing at writing various  types  of questions  and for judging  the  questions of others.  Students can be grouped in teams  of two and use  each other as  sounding boards regarding their ques­ tions.  Perhaps  the  class  can  develop  certain  guides  in formulating the several types  of questions.  The  develop­ ment of criteria for effective questions can be a class task. Here students could do some reading of the question and its importance. Students could read about inquiry in arti­ cles  published  in  school  magazines.

Related  to  writing  diverse  questions  is  being  able  to identify questions in written materials.  Students,  perhaps in teams, can analyze questions in textbooks  and various supplementary  books.  Such  analysis  could  focus  on  the intent  of  the  questions.  Also,  if  students  wished  to  gain information other than that asked for in the material, what types of questions  would they have to state?

## Learning Resource L

## Exercise in Reading

## a Book Proactively

## Rationale

Self-directed learning implies that learners take the initia­ tive in making use of resources, rather than simply react to transmissions from the resources. They know what they want to get from a resource, and they probe the resource until they get what they want.  They are proactive rather than  reactive learners.

But most of us have developed the habit of using re­ sources- especially books- reactively. We start reading a book on page one and read it through to the end, letting the author tell us the answers to the questions he or she thinks we ought to be asking. Of course, some books have to be read this way. Most works of fiction, creative essays, and  philosophical  essays  develop  plots  or  themes  with sequential elements.  But most books that we turn to for information, such as textbooks, reference books, manuals, and anthologies, are organized according to content cate­ gories.  Readers  who  know the  questions  to  which  they want answers can turn to the content category containing the answers to their questions. The book then takes on a different character; rather than being a one-way transmis­ sion of information, it is  a resource for self-directed in­ quiry.

## Objectives

The  objectives  of  this  exercise  are  to  help  the  learner (1)  gain an understanding of the concept of proactive use of resources, and  (2)  have an initial experience in prac­ ticing the skills of reading a book proactively.

## Exercise

- a.  In  the  advance  announcement  of  the  meeting at  which  this  exercise  is  to  be  conducted,  ask the participants to bring with them an informa­ tional book that has a dust jacket, table of con­ tents,  and index.  (It is wise for the teacher to bring a small supply of books for those partici­ pants who neglect to bring a book.)
- b.  In  opening  the  session,  explain  the  rationale and  objectives  of  the  exercise.
- c.  It adds zest to the exercise if you suggest that each participant exchange his or her book with another  participant,  so  that  each  is  working with an unfamiliar book.
- d.  Ask the participants to take the following steps:
- (1)  Turn  to  the  front  of  the  dust  jacket  and read what the publisher has  to  say  about the purpose of the book.
- (2)  Turn  to  the  rear  of  the  dust  jacket  and read  what the  publisher  has  to  say  about the author and his or her qualifications to write such a book.
- (3)  Turn  to the  front  matter (introduction, foreword,  preface)  and  read  the  author' s or editor'  orientation to the book. s
- (4)  Turn to the table of contents and see how the  author  has  organized  the  information

- into chapters, subsections, or other content categories.
- (5)  Put  the  book  down,  get  out  a  sheet  of paper, and  write  down three questions about  things you  have  become  curious about as a result of this preliminary exam­ ination of the book.
- (6)  Now that you have thought of three ques­ tions,  review the first question and find in it  a  key  word  or  phrase  that  you  think might be in  the book'   index. s
- (7)  Turn  to  the  index  and  look  up  that  key word or phrase.  If the word or phrase  is not there,  think  of  a  synonym  and  see  if the  synonym  is  there.  If it isn'   then  see t, if the table of contents can lead you to the page  of the  book  where  the  question  can be  answered.
- (8)  Now turn to that part of the book that deals with your question and get the answer.  If the author refers to material in other parts of the book, follow his leads until you have all the  information  relevant  to  your  ques­ tion.
- (9)  If time  allows,  follow  the  same  procedure with  the  second  and  third  questions.
- e.  Now engage the participants in  an  analysis  of their experience.  Such questions  as  the follow­ ing usually  produce  deepened  insights:
- (1)  How  differently  did  you  feel  about  using a  book  as  a  resource  from  the  way  you usually  feel about reading  a book?
- (2)  Is there any difference in the quality of the information  you  have  gained?

## Learning Resource M Exercise in Using Human

## Resources Proactively

## Rationale

The rationale for this exercise is the same as for Learning Resource  L.

## Objectives

The  objectives  of  this  exercise  are  to  help  the  learner (1) gain an understanding of the concept of proactive use of human resources,  and  (2)  have  an  initial  experience in  practicing  the  skills  of  using  a  human  resource  pro­ actively.

## Exercise

- a.  If this exercise is not being conducted in con­ junction  with  Learning  Resource  L,  explain the  rationale,  given  in  Learning  Resource  L, and  the  above  objectives.
- b.  Ask each participant to pair off with one of the other participants he or she knows least about.
- c.  Ask the participants in each pair to take fifteen minutes each describing to the other what he or

- she  perceives  to  be  the principal resources  he or  she  possesses  (as  a  result  of  experiences, previous training,  reading,  etc.)  that might  be useful to others.
- d.  Ask  each  participant  to  take  five  minutes  to formulate three questions he or she would like to get answers to from his or her partner.
- e.  Give each participant fifteen minutes to get the answers to his or her questions from the partner.
- f. Engage  the  participants  in  an  analysis  of  the experience by asking questions similar to those in Learning Resource L.

## Types of  Evidence

## for Different Objectives

Different types of evidence are required for assessing the accomplishment of different objectives. The examples be­ low may provide guidance in thinking of ways you might go  about  getting  evidence  that  is  appropriate  for  your objectives.

Objective KNOWLEDGE

UNDERSTANDING

SKILLS

Types of Evidence

Reports  of  knowledge  acquired, as  in  essays,  examinations,  oral presentations, audiovisual presen­ tations.

Examples of utilization of knowl­ edge  in  solving  problems,  as  in critical incident cases, simulation games, proposals of action proj­ ects,  research projects with  con­ clusions  and  recommendations.

Performance  exercises,  with  rat­ ings  by  observers.

## ATTITUDES

## VALUES

Attitudinal  rating  scales;  perfor­ mance  in  role  playing,  critical incident cases, simulation games, sensitivity groups, etc., with feed­ back  from  observers.

Value rating scales; performance in value clarification groups, crit­ ical incident cases, simulation games,  etc.,  with feedback from observers.

## Learning Resource O Some Examples of Rating Scales

The  instruments  reproduced  on  the  next  few  pages  are examples  of rating  scales  that  were  constructed  by  stu­ dents in one of my courses  (ED 559E:  Adult Learning) to collect or validate evidence of accomplishment of vari­ ous objectives.

They  are  presented  here  in  the  hope  that  they  may stimulate ideas for constructing your own instruments.

## Guidelines for Contract Learning

Many students find that the idea of constructing learning con­ tracts for the first  time  is so strange  that they becom e over­ anxious. They have been so conditioned to having teachers tell them what they are to learn and how they are to learn it that they become confused and worried when confronted with the responsibility  of  thinking  through  what  they  want  to  learn and how they will go about learning it. These guidelines have been developed in the hope that they will facilitate your en­ tering into this process with more security and greater ease.

## Why Contract Learning?

One of the most significant findings from research about adult learning  (see, for example, Allen Tough'  The Adult'  Learn­ s s ing Projects)  is that when adults go about learning something naturally  (as  contrasted  with  being  taught),  they  are  highly self-directing. Evidence is accumulating that what adults learn on  their  own  initiative  they  learn  more  deeply  and  perma­ nently than what they learn by being taught.  In fact,  there is strong  evidence  from  both  psychotherapeutical  and  develop-

mental  psychological  research  that  a  prime  characteristic  of adultness is the need and capacity to be self-directing.

But it is a fact of life  that when  an  individual  enters  into certain  educational  situations,  such  as  professional  prepara­ tion,  given requirements  are imposed on him. The profession itself- as  represented  by  licensing  boards,  certification  stan­ dards,  and  acceptance by peers- specifies that certain knowl­ edges,  skills,  attitudes,  and  values  must  have  been  acquired as  a  condition  for admission  to  the  profession.  Colleges  and universities  spell  out  minimum  standards  of  achievement  as conditions for awarding their degrees.

The learning contract is  a means  of reconciling  these  ' im­ posed'   requirements  from  institutions  and  society  with  the learners'need  to  be  self-directing.  It  enables  them  to  blend these  requirements  in  with  their  own  personal  goals  and  ob­ jectives, to choose  their own ways of achieving them, and to measure their own progress toward achieving them. The learn­ ing contract thus makes visible the mutual responsibilities  of the learner, the teacher, and the institution.

## How do you develop a learning contract?

Step 1.  In the opening session of the course you will be given a syllabus which contains a)  a list of the ' given'objectives of the course, b)  a list of references containing information rel­ evant to these objectives, and c)  a list of ' inquiry units'speci­ fying the kinds of questions with which the course deals. The course instructor will review these elements and dialogue with you for clarification and understanding. You have the respon­ sibility  to take  the  initiative  in  probing to  eliminate  any  con ­ fusion at this  point.

Between the first and the second sessions you will  have the responsibility  of  familiarizing  yourself  with  the  territory  the course  is  designed  to  explore- scan  the  literature,  talk  with people who are experienced  in the field of study,  and  reflect on  your  own  model  of  excellence  for  yourself.  In  this  step you are developing your model of competencies  (knowledges,

skills, attitudes, and  values) regarding  the  content  of  the course- a model  which  includes  the  objectives  given  in  the syllabus that are relevant to you plus your own personal ob­ jectives that go beyond those given in the syllabus.

Step 2.  In the second session you will be given a set of blank contract forms  along  with  some  examples  of contracts  from previous courses. Notice that the contract forms include one form for a B-level contract and one form for an A  -level con­ tract. Y ou may contract for a B only, if you wish. But if you wish  to contract for  an A,  both  the  B-level  and  the A -level forms are to be filled out.

What  is  the  difference  between  a  B-level  and  an  A  -level contract? A  B-level contract is based on the  accomplishment of  the  ' given' objectives  contained  in  the  syllabus,  on  the assumption that these describe the core content of the course that all students should acquire in order to be able to perform adequately  in  this  aspect  of  the  field.  An  A-level  contract, however, should specify objectives over and above these ' gen­ eralist'objectives; it should describe learnings that would en­ able you to perform with distinction in  one or  more  aspects of the content. The difference, in short, is between ' adequate' accomplishment and ' distinguished'  accomplishment. Whether or not your contract achieves  this  difference  acceptably  is  a matter for negotiation between you  and the instructor- with consultation from your peers.

Now you are ready to start filling out the first column of the contract form- ' Learning Objectives.'   Start with  the B-level contract. First, review the objectives in the syllabus. Y ou may already  have  accomplished  one  or  more  of  these  objectives through previous study or experience. If so, you don'  need to t include them  in  your contract,  but instead  attach  a  separate slip  to  the  contract  indicating  how  you  accomplished  them and  what  evidence you  have  that  you  did  accomplish  them.

Any objectives in the syllabus that you have not already ac­ complished should be inserted in the contract. You don'  need t to follow the wording used in the syllabus; you may put the

objectives  into  your  own  context- but  if  you  do,  indicate which objectives in the syllabus each of your objectives covers. Also, be sure that your objectives describe what you will learn, not what actions you will take. You may state them in what­ ever terms  are  most meaningful to  you- content  acquisition, behavioral performance, or directions of growth. But remem­ ber that they are learning objectives. Then, if you wish to con­ tract  for  an  A,  specify  what  objectives  (one  or  more)  you propose  to  accomplish  that  will  result  in  distinguished  per­ formance.

When you have finished listing your objectives, move over to  the  second column- ' Learning  Resources  and  Strategies,' and describe how you propose to go about accomplishing each objective.  Identify the  resources  (material  and  human)  you plan to use and the strategies you will employ in making use of them. The more specific you are in describing the resources and strategies, the more helpful the instructor can be in mak­ ing  further  suggestions.  Think  particularly  of people  in  the university (especially fellow students in this course)  and in the community who have expertness in the content area of the ob­ jective.  For  certain  kinds  of  objectives,  especially  those  in­ volving skills or attitudes, the most appropriate resource may be  your  own  experience  (through  a  field  project  or  experi­ ment)  and the most appropriate strategy may be  analysis  of that experience.

After completing the second column, move over to the third column- ' Evidence  of  Accomplishment  of  Objectives,' and specify  what  evidence  you  propose  to  collect.  Perhaps  the following  examples  of  evidence  will  stimulate  your  thinking about what evidence you might accumulate:

T Y P E  O F  O B J E C T I V E Knowledge

## E X A M P L E S  O F  E V I D E N C E

Reports of knowledge  acquired,  as in  essays,  examinations,  oral  pre­ sentations, audiovisual presenta­ tions; annotated bibliographies.

## T Y P E  O F  O B J E C T I V E Understanding

Skills

Attitudes

## E X A M P L E S  O F  E V I D E N C E

Examples  of  utilization  of  knowl­ edge in solving problems, as in ac­ tion projects, research projects with conclusions  and  recommendations, plans for curriculum change, etc.

Performance exercises,  video-taped performances,  etc.,  with ratings by observers.

Attitudinal rating scales; perfor­ mance in real situations, role play­ ing,  simulation games, critical inci­ dent cases, etc., with feedback from participants and/or observers.

Values

Value rating scales; performance in value  clarification  groups,  critical incident cases, simulation exercises, etc., with  feedback  from  partici­ pants  and/or observers.

After you have specified what evidence you will gather for each objective in  the third  column,  move  over to the fourth column- ' Criteria and  Means for Validating Evidence.'  For each objective, first specify what criteria you propose the evi­ dence will be judged  by.  The  criteria will  vary  according to the  type  of  objective.  For  example,  appropriate  criteria  for knowledge objectives might include comprehensiveness, depth, precision, clarity, authentication, usefulness, scholarliness, etc. For  skill  objectives,  more  appropriate  criteria may  be  poise, speed, flexibility, gracefulness, precision,  imaginativeness,  etc. After you have specified the criteria,  indicate the means  you propose to use to have the evidence judged according to these criteria. For example, if you produce a paper or report, who will  you have read  it  and what are their qualifications? Will they express  their judgments by rating scales,  descriptive  re-

ports, evaluative reports, or how? One of the actions that help to differentiate  ' distinguished'from  ' adequate'  performance in  self-directed  learning  is  the  wisdom  with  which  a  learner selects  his  or  her  validators.  In  this  course,  the  appropriate validators for certain objectives may be faculty members; for other objectives it may be peers in the course  (such as your consultation  team or  your  inquiry  team);  but  for  many  ob­ jectives  the most appropriate validators will be expert practi­ tioners out in the community.

Step 3.  After you have completed the first draft of your con­ tract  in the second session, you will participate in selecting a consultation team of three or four peers. Each member of the team will have a chance to review his or her contract with the other members of the team in order to get their reactions and suggestions.

Here are some questions you might ask them  as a way of getting optimal benefit from their help:

Are the learning objectives  clear,  understandable,  and realistic,  and  do  they  describe  what  you  propose  to learn?

Can they think of other objectives you might consider?

D o  the learning strategies  and  resources seem  reason­ able,  appropriate, and efficient?

Can they think  of other resources  and  strategies  you might consider?

Does the evidence seem relevant to the various objec­ tives,  and  would  it convince  them?

Can they suggest other evidence you might consider?

Are the criteria and means for validating the evidence clear, relevant, and convincing?

Can they think of other ways to validate the evidence that you might consider?

Between the second and third sessions you may wish to re­ vise your contracts in the light of the inputs from your con­ sultation  team,  and  as  a  result  o f  further  study  and  further reflection. In  any case,  the contracts  are due to be turned in to  the instructor  at the  beginning of the third session. H e or she will read them between the third and fourth sessions and return  them  to  you  with  comments  at  the  beginning  of  the fourth session. If the comments suggest further revisions, these should be submitted at the beginning of the fifth session.

Step  4.  Between  the  fourth  and  the  next-to-last  session  you will be carrying out the strategies, collecting the evidence, and having  the  evidence  validated  as  specified  in  your  contract. Thus, some of you will be engaging in group learning activi­ ties during this period, while others  of you may be engaging entirely  in  independent  study,  and  still  others  will  be  doing some of both.  At  any time  during this period  you  may find that your ideas about objectives, resources and strategies, and evidence are changing, and you may renegotiate your contract with the instructor accordingly.

Step 5.  At the next-to-last session  (usually the  13th or  14th) bring with  you  your contract  in  its  final  form,  the  evidence you have collected, and your evaluator'  validations. The en­ s tire session will be devoted to your presenting this ' package' to your consultation team and getting their reactions, sugges­ tions, and- if called for in your contract- further validations.

This entire package is to be turned in to the instructor at the end of this session. He or she will return it to you, with com ­ ments and his or her judgments, at the last session.  If further negotiation is required at this point because he or she cannot accept the evidence as fulfillment of the contract, it can take place at this session.

Happy self-directed learning!
